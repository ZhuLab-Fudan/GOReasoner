        "desc": "Activators of KATP channels failed to elicit currents in the presence or absence of co-expressed sulfonylurea receptor. These results show that two components of islet cell KIR channels, CIR and GIRK2, may interact to form heteromeric G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ channels that do not possess the typical properties of KATP channels. The cardiac inward rectifier K+ channel subunit, CIR, does not comprise the ATP-sensitive K+ channel, IKATP. Cardiac IKACh is comprised of two inwardly rectifying K+ channel subunits, CIR and GIRK1 (Krapivinsky, G., Gordon, E. G., Wickman, K., Velimirovic, B., Krapivinsky, L., and Clapham, D. E. (1995) Nature 374, 135-141). A cardiac protein virtually identical to CIR, termed rcKATP-1 (Ashford, M. L. J., Bond, C. T., Blair, T. A., and Adelman, J. P. (1994) Nature 370, 456-459), was reported to form an ATP-sensitive inwardly rectifying K+ channel, IKATP. We attempted to determine whether CIR alone or together with an unknown\nthe target for sulfonylureas used in the treatment of NIDDM, the available data suggest that the identified KATP channel mutations do not play a major role in diabetes. Understanding how KATP channels fit into the overall scheme of glucose homeostasis, on the other hand, promises insight into diabetes and other disorders of glucose metabolism, while understanding the structure and regulation of these channels offers potential for development of novel compounds to regulate cellular electrical activity. G-protein mediated gating of inward-rectifier K+ channels. G-protein regulated inward-rectifier potassium channels (GIRK) are part of a superfamily of inward-rectifier K+ channels which includes seven family members. To date four GIRK subunits, designated GIRK1-4 (also designated Kir3.1-4), have been identified in mammals, and GIRK5 has been found in Xenopus oocytes. GIRK channels exist in vivo both as homotetramers and heterotetramers. In contrast to the other mammalian GIRK family members, GIRK1 can not form functional channels\nkinetics and rectification. Expression of covalently linked subunits demonstrated that the relative subunit positions, as well as stoichiometry, affect heteromeric channel activity. Direct activation of inward rectifier potassium channels by PIP2 and its stabilization by Gbetagamma. Inward rectifier K+ channels, which modulate electrical activity in many cell types, are regulated by protein kinases, guanine-nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and probably actin cytoskeleton. Generation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) by ATP-dependent lipid kinases is known to activate inward rectifier K+ channels in cardiac membrane patches. Here we report that several cloned inward rectifier K+ channels directly bind PIP2, and that this binding correlates with channel activity. Application of ATP or PIP2 liposomes activates the cloned channels. Stabilized by lipid phosphatase inhibitors, PIP2 antibodies potently inhibit each channel with a unique rate (GIRK1/4 approximately GIRK2 >> IRK1 approximately ROMK. Consistent with the faster dissociation of PIP2 from the GIRK channels, the carboxy terminus of\nform an ATP-sensitive inwardly rectifying K+ channel, IKATP. We attempted to determine whether CIR alone or together with an unknown protein(s) participated in the formation of cardiac IKATP. Expression of CIR in insect, oocyte, and mammalian cell systems did not increase the appearance of ATP-sensitive currents, but rather gave rise to unique strongly inwardly rectifying, G protein-regulated K+ currents. CIR protein is found exclusively in atria, in contrast to the predominance of IKATP functional activity in ventricle. Also, CIR was completely depleted from heart membrane after immunodepletion of GIRK1. We conclude that CIR/rcKATP-1 is not a subunit of cardiac IKATP and that GIRK1 is the only channel protein coassociating with CIR in heart. Molecular biology of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels. KATP channels are a newly defined class of potassium channels based on the physical association of an ABC protein, the sulfonylurea receptor, and a K+ inward rectifier subunit. The beta-cell\nalso resulted in a decrease in channel function and termini association. We hypothesize that the hydrophobic nature of this GIRK1 subunit region is critical for interaction between adjacent termini and is permissive for channel gating. In addition, the homologous mutation in cytoplasmic domains of Kir2.1 (L330R) did not disrupt association, suggesting that the overall structural integrity of this region is critical for inward rectifier function. Pancreatic islet cells express a family of inwardly rectifying K+ channel subunits which interact to form G-protein-activated channels. Insulin secretion is associated with changes in pancreatic beta-cell K+ permeability. A degenerate polymerase chain reaction strategy based on the conserved features of known inwardly rectifying K+ (KIR) channel genes was used to identify members of this family expressed in human pancreatic islets and insulinoma. Three related human KIR transcript sequences were found: CIR (also known as cardiac KATP-1), GIRK1, and GIRK2 (KATP-2). The pancreatic islet CIR\na Walker type-A ATP-binding motif in their carboxyl termini, and may be involved in K+ transport in renal epithelial and brain glial cells. uKATP-1 and BIR form with sulfonylurea receptors, the so-called ATP-sensitive K+ channels. Thus, it is a feature of the Kir channel family that each subfamily plays a specific physiological functional role. The (Na+)-activated Kir channels identified electrophysiologically in neurons and cardiac myocytes have not yet been cloned. In this review, we overviewed the current understandings of the features of the molecular structures and functions of the four main subfamilies of Kir channels. Inward rectifier potassium channels. Cloning, expression and structure-function studies. A PCR-based cloning strategy was used to identify novel subunits of the two-transmembrane domain inward rectifier potassium channel family from rat brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, two of these clones (Kir4.1 and Kir2.3) gave rise to inwardly rectifying potassium currents. Two-electrode\nan effect that was reversed in the GIRK4(S418A) mutant. This mechanistic insight into the PKC\u03b5-mediated increase in channel activity because of GIRK4(S418) phosphorylation, provides a precise druggable target to reverse AF-related pathologies due to GIRK overactivity. Familial Sinus Node Disease Caused by a Gain of GIRK (G-Protein Activated Inwardly Rectifying K+ Channel) Channel Function. BACKGROUND: Inherited forms of sinus node dysfunction (SND) clinically include bradycardia, sinus arrest, and chronotropic incompetence and may serve as disease models to understand sinus node physiology and impulse generation. Recently, a gain-of-function mutation in the G-protein gene GNB2 led to enhanced activation of the GIRK (G-protein activated inwardly rectifying K+ channel). Thus, human cardiac GIRK channels are important for heart rate regulation and subsequently, genes encoding their subunits Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 ( KCNJ3 and KCNJ5) are potential candidates for inherited SND in human.METHODS: We performed a combined approach of targeted sequencing of KCNJ3 and KCNJ5\nEvidence that neuronal G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channels are activated by G beta gamma subunits and function as heteromultimers. Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) activate K+ conductances in cardiac atrial cells to slow heart rate and in neurons to decrease excitability. cDNAs encoding three isoforms of a G-protein-coupled, inwardly rectifying K+ channel (GIRK) have recently been cloned from cardiac (GIRK1/Kir 3.1) and brain cDNA libraries (GIRK2/Kir 3.2 and GIRK3/Kir 3.3). Here we report that GIRK2 but not GIRK3 can be activated by G protein subunits G beta 1 and G gamma 2 in Xenopus oocytes. Furthermore, when either GIRK3 or GIRK2 was coexpressed with GIRK1 and activated either by muscarinic receptors or by G beta gamma subunits, G-protein-mediated inward currents were increased by 5- to 40-fold. The single-channel conductance for GIRK1 plus GIRK2 coexpression was intermediate between those for GIRK1 alone and for GIRK2 alone, and voltage-jump kinetics for the\nbased on the physical association of an ABC protein, the sulfonylurea receptor, and a K+ inward rectifier subunit. The beta-cell KATP channel is composed of SUR1, the high-affinity sulfonylurea receptor with multiple TMDs and two NBFs, and KIR6.2, a weak inward rectifier, in a 1:1 stoichiometry. The pore of the channel is formed by KIR6.2 in a tetrameric arrangement; the overall stoichiometry of active channels is (SUR1/KIR6.2)4. The two subunits form a tightly integrated whole. KIR6.2 can be expressed in the plasma membrane either by deletion of an ER retention signal at its C-terminal end or by high-level expression to overwhelm the retention mechanism. The single-channel conductance of the homomeric KIR6.2 channels is equivalent to SUR/KIR6.2 channels, but they differ in all other respects, including bursting behavior, pharmacological properties, sensitivity to ATP and ADP, and trafficking to the plasma membrane. Coexpression with SUR restores the normal channel properties. The key\nGIRK2 and GIRK3 subunits exist in brain. Mechanism of PKC\u03b5 regulation of cardiac GIRK channel gating. G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel activity is regulated by the membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5P2). Constitutive activity of cardiac GIRK channels in atrial myocytes, that is implicated in atrial fibrillation (AF), is mediated via a protein kinase C-\u03b5 (PKC\u03b5)-dependent mechanism. The novel PKC isoform, PKC\u03b5, is reported to enhance the activity of cardiac GIRK channels. Here, we report that PKC\u03b5 stimulation leads to activation of GIRK channels in mouse atria and in human stem cell-derived atrial cardiomyocytes (iPSCs). We identified residue GIRK4(S418) which when mutated to Ala abolished, or to Glu, mimicked the effects of PKC\u03b5 on GIRK currents. PKC\u03b5 strengthened the interactions of the cardiac GIRK isoforms, GIRK4 and GIRK1/4 with PIP2, an effect that was reversed in the GIRK4(S418A) mutant. This mechanistic insight into the PKC\u03b5-mediated increase in channel activity because\nGIRK1 plus GIRK2 coexpression was intermediate between those for GIRK1 alone and for GIRK2 alone, and voltage-jump kinetics for the coexpressed channels displayed new kinetic properties. On the other hand, coexpression of GIRK3 with GIRK2 suppressed the GIRK2 alone response. These studies suggest that formation of heteromultimers involving the several GIRKs is an important mechanism for generating diversity in expression level and function of neurotransmitter-coupled, inward rectifier K+ channels. Mutation of critical GIRK subunit residues disrupts N- and C-termini association and channel function. The subfamily of G-protein-linked inwardly rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs) is coupled to G-protein receptors throughout the CNS and in the heart. We used mutational analysis to address the role of a specific hydrophobic region of the GIRK1 subunit. Deletion of the GIRK1 C-terminal residues 330-384, as well as the point mutation I331R, resulted in a decrease in channel function when coexpressed with GIRK4 in oocytes and in\n10-fold. Thus Gbetagamma activates GIRK channels by stabilizing interactions between PIP2 and the K+ channel. Functional and biochemical evidence for G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels composed of GIRK2 and GIRK3. G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K(+) (GIRK) channels are widely expressed in the brain and are activated by at least eight different neurotransmitters. As K(+) channels, they drive the transmembrane potential toward E(K) when open and thus dampen neuronal excitability. There are four mammalian GIRK subunits (GIRK1-4 or Kir 3.1-4), with GIRK1 being the most unique of the four by possessing a long carboxyl-terminal tail. Early studies suggested that GIRK1 was an integral component of native GIRK channels. However, more recent data indicate that native channels can be either homo- or heterotetrameric complexes composed of several GIRK subunit combinations. The functional implications of subunit composition are poorly understood at present. The purpose of this study was to examine the functional and\nand absorption of K+ ions across cell membrane. Recent molecular biological dissection has shown that the DNAs encoding Kir channels constitute a new family of K+ channels whose subunits contain two putative transmembrane domains and a pore-forming region. So far, more than ten cDNAs of Kir channel subunits have been isolated and classified into four subfamilies: 1) IRK subfamily (IRK1-3/Kir1.1-1.3), 2) GIRK subfamily (GIRK1-4/Kir3.1-3.4), 3) ATP-dependent Kir subfamily (ROMK1/Kir1.1, K(AB)-2/Kir4.1), and 4) ATP-sensitive Kir subfamily (uKATP-1/Kir6.1, BIR/Kir6.2). Xenopus oocytes injected with the cRNAs of IRKs elicit classical Kir channel currents. GIRKs, as heteromultimers, compose the G protein-gated Kir (KG) channels, which are regulated by a variety of Gi/Go-coupled inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors such as m2-mus-carinic, serotonergic (5HT1A), GABAB, somatostatin and opioid (mu, delta, kappa) receptors. ROMK1 and KAB-2 are characterized with a Walker type-A ATP-binding motif in their carboxyl termini, and may be involved in K+ transport in renal epithelial and\nexcitability of neurons and may contribute to the resting potential. Interestingly, only the GIRK1 and 4 subunits are distributed in the atrial and sinoatrial node cells of the heart and are involved in the regulation of cardiac rate. Our main objective of this review is to assess the current understanding of the G-protein modulation of GIRK channels and their physiological importance in mammals. Inwardly rectifying potassium channels: their molecular heterogeneity and function. A variety of cells including cardiac myocytes and neuronal cells possess inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) channels through which currents flow more readily in the inward direction than outward. These K+ channels play pivotal roles in maintenance of the resting membrane potential, in regulation of the action potential duration, in receptor-dependent inhibition of cellular excitability, and in the secretion and absorption of K+ ions across cell membrane. Recent molecular biological dissection has shown that the DNAs encoding Kir channels\nimplications of subunit composition are poorly understood at present. The purpose of this study was to examine the functional and biochemical properties of GIRK channels formed by the co-assembly of GIRK2 and GIRK3, the most abundant GIRK subunits found in the mammalian brain. To examine the properties of a channel composed of these two subunits, we co-transfected GIRK2 and GIRK3 in CHO-K1 cells and assayed the cells for channel activity by patch clamp. The most significant difference between the putative GIRK2/GIRK3 heteromultimeric channel and GIRK1/GIRKx channels at the single channel level was an approximately 5-fold lower sensitivity to activation by Gbetagamma. Complexes containing only GIRK2 and GIRK3 could be immunoprecipitated from transfected cells and could be purified from native brain tissue. These data indicate that functional GIRK channels composed of GIRK2 and GIRK3 subunits exist in brain. Mechanism of PKC\u03b5 regulation of cardiac GIRK channel gating. G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium\nare potential candidates for inherited SND in human.METHODS: We performed a combined approach of targeted sequencing of KCNJ3 and KCNJ5 in 52 patients with idiopathic SND and subsequent whole exome sequencing of additional family members in a genetically affected patient. A putative novel disease-associated gene variant was functionally analyzed by voltage-clamp experiments using various heterologous cell expression systems (Xenopus oocytes, CHO cells, and rat atrial cardiomyocytes).RESULTS: In a 3-generation family with SND we identified a novel variant in KCNJ5 which leads to an amino acid substitution (p.Trp101Cys) in the first transmembrane domain of the Kir3.4 subunit of the cardiac GIRK channel. The identified variant cosegregated with the disease in the family and was absent in the Exome Variant Server and Exome Aggregation Consortium databases. Expression of mutant Kir3.4 (\u00b1native Kir3.1) in different heterologous cell expression systems resulted in increased GIRK currents ( IK,ACh) and a reduced inward rectification which was\nWhen expressed in Xenopus oocytes, two of these clones (Kir4.1 and Kir2.3) gave rise to inwardly rectifying potassium currents. Two-electrode voltage clamp commands to potentials negative to EK evoked inward potassium-selective currents which rapidly reached a peak amplitude and then relaxed to a steady-state level. Differences in the extent of current relaxation, the degree of rectification, and the voltage-dependent block by external cesium were detected. Two other members of this family (Kir5.1 and Kir3.4) did not produce macroscopic currents, when expressed by themselves, yet both subunits modified the currents when coexpressed with other specific members of the Kir family. Expression of chimeric subunits between Kir4.1 and either Kir5.1 or Kir3.4 suggested that the transmembrane domains determine the specificity of subunit heteropolymerization, while the C-terminal domains contribute to alterations in activation kinetics and rectification. Expression of covalently linked subunits demonstrated that the relative subunit positions, as well as stoichiometry, affect heteromeric\nas the point mutation I331R, resulted in a decrease in channel function when coexpressed with GIRK4 in oocytes and in COS-7 cells. Surface protein expression of GIRK1 I331R coexpressed with GIRK4 was comparable with wild type, indicating that subunits assemble and are correctly localized to the membrane. Subsequent mutation of homologous residues in both the GIRK4 subunit and Kir2.1 (Gbetagamma-independent inward rectifier) also resulted in a decrease in channel function. Intracellular domain associations resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of the GIRK1 N and C termini and GIRK4 N and C termini. The point mutation I331R in the GIRK1 C terminus or L337R in the GIRK4 C terminus decreased the association between the N and C termini. Mutation of a GIRK1 N-terminal hydrophobic residue, predicted structurally to interact with the C-terminal domain, also resulted in a decrease in channel function and termini association. We hypothesize that the hydrophobic nature of this GIRK1\nGIRK2 >> IRK1 approximately ROMK. Consistent with the faster dissociation of PIP2 from the GIRK channels, the carboxy terminus of GIRK1 binds 3H-PIP2 liposomes more weakly than does that of IRK1 or ROMK1. Mutation of a conserved arginine to glutamine at position 188 reduces the ability of ROMK1 to bind PIP2 and increases its sensitivity to inhibition by PIP2 antibodies. Interactions between GIRK channels and PIP2 are modulated by the betagamma subunits of the G protein (Gbetagamma). When GIRK1/4 channels are allowed to run down completely, they are not activated by addition of Gbetagamma alone, but application of PIP2 activates them in minutes without Gbetagamma and in just seconds with Gbetagamma. Finally, coexpression of Gbetagamma with GIRK channels slows the inhibition of K+ currents by PIP2 antibodies by more than 10-fold. Thus Gbetagamma activates GIRK channels by stabilizing interactions between PIP2 and the K+ channel. Functional and biochemical evidence for\nin different heterologous cell expression systems resulted in increased GIRK currents ( IK,ACh) and a reduced inward rectification which was not compensated by intracellular spermidine. Moreover, in silico modeling of heterotetrameric mutant GIRK channels indicates a structurally altered binding site for spermine.CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, an inherited gain-of-function mutation in the human GIRK3.4 causes familial human SND. The increased activity of GIRK channels is likely to lead to a sustained hyperpolarization of pacemaker cells and thereby reduces heart rate. Modulation of human GIRK channels may pave a way for further treatment of cardiac pacemaking.",

The perfusion-biotinylated proteins and proteins bound to them were isolated with CaptAvidin-agarose beads, separated with SDS-PAGE, and sliced into continuous gel pieces for LC-MS/MS protein identification (LTQ, Thermo Electron Corp.). 17 integral and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked membrane proteins and 44 non-integral membrane proteins were identified. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy confirmed ACVRL1, H(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1, NHE2, and TauT expression in the IMCDs. Basement membrane and basolateral membrane proteins were biotinylated via incubation of IMCD suspensions with biotinylation reagents on ice. 23 integral and GPI-linked membrane proteins and 134 non-integral membrane proteins were identified.

Retromer is a membrane-associated heteropentameric coat complex that functions in the endosome-to-Golgi retrieval of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor, the Wntless protein and other membrane proteins of physiological significance. Retromer comprises two functional subcomplexes: the cargo-selective subcomplex is a trimer of the VPS35, VPS29, VPS26 proteins, whereas the sorting nexin proteins, Snx1 and Snx2 function to tubulate the endosomal membrane. Unlike the sorting nexins, which contain PtdIns3P-binding PX domains, the cargo-selective VPS35/29/26 complex has no lipid-binding domains and its recruitment to the endosomal membrane remains mechanistically uncharacterised. In this study we show that the VPS35/29/26 complex interacts with the small GTPase Rab7 and requires Rab7 for its recruitment to the endosome. We show that the Rab7K157N mutant that causes the peripheral neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, does not interact with the VPS35/29/26 complex,\nkinases, scaffold proteins, SNARE proteins, motor proteins, small GTP-binding proteins, and related proteins that may be involved in vasopressin-stimulated AQP2, UT-A1, and ENaC regulation.

The Ezrin, Radixin, and Moesin (ERM) proteins play a major role in organizing cortical domains by assembling membrane protein complexes and linking them to the cortical actin cytoskeleton. Many studies have focused on the individual roles of the ERM proteins in stabilizing the membrane-cytoskeleton interface, controlling the distribution and function of apical membrane complexes, regulating the small GTPase Rho, or establishing cell-cell junctions. We previously found that deletion of the mouse Ezrin gene yields severe defects in apical integrity throughout the developing intestinal epithelium, resulting in\nWe show that the Rab7K157N mutant that causes the peripheral neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, does not interact with the VPS35/29/26 complex, resulting in a weakened association with the membrane. We have also identified a novel retromer-interacting protein, TBC1D5, which is a member of the Rab GAP family of proteins that negatively regulates VPS35/29/26 recruitment and causes Rab7 to dissociate from the membrane. We therefore propose that recruitment of the cargo-selective VPS35/29/26 complex is catalysed by Rab7 and inhibited by the Rab-GAP protein, TBC1D5. LC-MS/MS analysis of apical and basolateral plasma membranes of rat renal collecting duct cells. We used biotinylation and streptavidin affinity chromatography to label and enrich proteins from apical and basolateral membranes of rat kidney inner medullary collecting ducts (IMCDs) prior to LC-MS/MS protein identification. To enrich apical membrane proteins and bound peripheral membrane proteins, IMCDs were perfusion-labeled with primary amine-reactive biotinylation reagents at 2 degrees C using a\na different approach, an anti-GFP-functionalized surface was used to capture in situ expressed K-K via its sfGFP tag. Interestingly, only the K-K-functionalized capture surface prepared by the latter strategy was able to interact with K-K's small binding partners. This generalizable approach can be further extended to other membrane proteins for developing direct binding assays involving small ligands. Adaptation of the wine bacterium Oenococcus oeni to ethanol stress: role of the small heat shock protein Lo18 in membrane integrity. Malolactic fermentation in wine is often carried out by Oenococcus oeni. Wine is a stressful environment for bacteria because ethanol is a toxic compound that impairs the integrity of bacterial membranes. The small heat shock protein (sHsp) Lo18 is an essential actor of the stress response in O. oeni. Lo18 prevents the thermal aggregation of proteins and plays a crucial role in membrane quality control. Here, we investigated the interaction between Lo18\nsorting and assembly machinery (SAM complex) of the outer membrane plays a central role in this process. The SAM complex mediates the membrane integration of \u03b2-barrel precursor proteins including Tom40. The small Tom proteins Tom5 and Tom6 associate with the precursor of Tom40 at the SAM complex at an early stage of the assembly process and play a stimulatory role in the formation of the mature TOM complex. A fraction of the SAM components interacts with the outer membrane protein mitochondrial distribution and morphology protein 10 (Mdm10) to form the SAM-Mdm10 machinery; however, different views exist on the function of the SAM-Mdm10 complex. We report here that the third small Tom protein, Tom7, plays an inhibitory role at two distinct steps in the biogenesis of the TOM complex. First, Tom7 plays an antagonistic role to Tom5 and Tom6 at the early stage of Tom40 assembly at the SAM complex. Second,\nmembrane interactions. This study illustrates how integrative modeling based on varied low-resolution structural data can inform biologically relevant hypotheses, even in the absence of high-resolution data. On-chip membrane protein cell-free expression enables development of a direct binding assay: A curious case of potassium channel KcsA-Kv1.3. Despite the significant role integral membrane proteins (IMPs) play in the drug discovery process, it remains extremely challenging to express, purify, and in vitro stabilize them for detailed biophysical analyses. Cell-free transcription-translation systems have emerged as a promising alternative for producing complex proteins, but they are still not a viable option for expressing IMPs due to improper post-translational folding of these proteins. We have studied key factors influencing in vitro folding of cell-free-expressed IMPs, particularly oligomeric proteins (i.e., ion channels). Using a chimeric ion channel, KcsA-Kv1.3 (K-K), as a model IMP, we have investigated several physiochemical determinants including artificial bilayer environments (i.e., lipid, detergent) for\nmimicked ethanol action by temperature-dependent fluidization of the liposomes. Results suggest that the principal determinant of Lo18-membrane interaction is lipid bilayer phase behavior rather than phospholipid composition. We suggest a model to describe the ethanol adaptation of O. oeni. This model highlights the dual role of Lo18 in the protection of proteins from aggregation and membrane stabilization and suggests how modifications of phospholipid content may be a key factor determining the balance between these two functions. Biogenesis of mitochondria: dual role of Tom7 in modulating assembly of the preprotein translocase of the outer membrane. Biogenesis of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM complex) involves the assembly of the central \u03b2-barrel forming protein Tom40 with six different subunits that are embedded in the membrane via \u03b1-helical transmembrane segments. The sorting and assembly machinery (SAM complex) of the outer membrane plays a central role in this process. The SAM complex\nanalysis, we observed that 65 nonclassical SPM proteins formed 12 highly interconnected clusters with 47 classical SPM proteins, suggesting that they were the more likely SPM candidates. Taken together, the results of this study provide an integrated tool for analyzing the SPM proteome of small brain tissues, as well as a dataset of putative novel SPM proteins to improve the understanding of hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Integrative structure and function of the yeast exocyst complex. Exocyst is an evolutionarily conserved hetero-octameric tethering complex that plays a variety of roles in membrane trafficking, including exocytosis, endocytosis, autophagy, cell polarization, cytokinesis, pathogen invasion, and metastasis. Exocyst serves as a platform for interactions between the Rab, Rho, and Ral small GTPases, SNARE proteins, and Sec1/Munc18 regulators that coordinate spatial and temporal fidelity of membrane fusion. However, its mechanism is poorly described at the molecular level. Here, we determine the molecular architecture of the yeast\nthermal aggregation of proteins and plays a crucial role in membrane quality control. Here, we investigated the interaction between Lo18 and four types of liposomes: one was prepared from O. oeni grown under optimal growth conditions (here, control liposomes), one was prepared from O. oeni grown in the presence of 8% ethanol (here, ethanol liposomes), one was prepared from synthetic phospholipids, and one was prepared from phospholipids from Bacillus subtilis or Lactococcus lactis. We observed the strongest interaction between Lo18 and control liposomes. The lipid binding activity of Lo18 required the dissociation of oligomeric structures into dimers. Protein protection experiments carried out in the presence of the liposomes from O. oeni suggested that Lo18 had a higher affinity for control liposomes than for a model protein. In anisotropy experiments, we mimicked ethanol action by temperature-dependent fluidization of the liposomes. Results suggest that the principal determinant of Lo18-membrane interaction is lipid\nincreases the mitochondrial localization of AGK and subsequently inhibits AGK-mediated AKT phosphorylation. Moreover, the formation of the SMIM26-AGK-SCL25A11 complex maintains mitochondrial glutathione import and respiratory efficiency, which is abrogated by AGK overexpression or SLC25A11 knockdown. This study functionally characterizes the LINC00493-encoded microprotein SMIM26 and establishes its anti-metastatic role in ccRCC, and therefore illuminates the importance of hidden proteins in human cancers. In-depth analysis of the synaptic plasma membrane proteome of small hippocampal slices using an integrated approach. Comprehensive knowledge of the synaptic plasma membrane (SPM) proteome of a distinct brain region in a defined pathological state would greatly advance the understanding of the underlying biology of synaptic plasticity. The development of innovative approaches for studying the SPM proteome of small brain tissues is highly desired. This study presents a suitable protocol that integrates biotinylation-based affinity capture of cell surface-exposed proteins, isolation of synaptosomes, and biochemical extraction of SPM proteins from\nKcsA-Kv1.3 (K-K), as a model IMP, we have investigated several physiochemical determinants including artificial bilayer environments (i.e., lipid, detergent) for K-K in vitro stabilization. We observed that fusion of a 'superfolder' green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) to K-K as a protein expression reporter not only improves the protein yield, but surprisingly facilitates the K-K tetramer formation, probably by enhancing the solubility of monomeric K-K. Additionally, anionic lipids (i.e., DMPG) were found to be essential for the correct folding of cell-free-expressed monomeric K-K into tetramer, underscoring the importance of lipid-protein interaction in maintaining structural-functional integrity of ion channels. We further developed methods to integrate cell-free-expressed IMPs directly onto a biosensor chip. We employed a solid-supported lipid bilayer onto the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) chip to insert nascent K-K in a membrane. In a different approach, an anti-GFP-functionalized surface was used to capture in situ expressed K-K via its sfGFP tag. Interestingly, only\nprotocol that integrates biotinylation-based affinity capture of cell surface-exposed proteins, isolation of synaptosomes, and biochemical extraction of SPM proteins from biotinylated hippocampal slices. The effectiveness of this integrated method was initially confirmed using immunoblot analysis of synaptic markers. Subsequently, we used highly sensitive mass spectrometry and streamlined bioinformatics to analyze the obtained SPM protein-enriched fraction. Our workflow positively identified 241 SPM proteins comprising 85 previously reported classical proteins from the pre- and/or post-synaptic membrane and 156 nonclassical proteins that localized to both the plasma membrane and synapse, and have not been previously reported as SPM proteins. Further analyses revealed considerable similarities in the physicochemical and functional properties of these proteins. Analysis of the interaction network using STRING indicated that the two groups showed a relatively strong functional correlation. Using MCODE analysis, we observed that 65 nonclassical SPM proteins formed 12 highly interconnected clusters with 47 classical SPM proteins, suggesting that\nfunction of Ezrin in building and maintaining the apical domain is essential not only for intestinal morphogenesis but also for homeostasis in the mature intestine. LINC00493-encoded microprotein SMIM26 exerts anti-metastatic activity in renal cell carcinoma. Human microproteins encoded by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) have been increasingly discovered, however, complete functional characterization of these emerging proteins is scattered. Here, we show that LINC00493-encoded SMIM26, an understudied microprotein localized in mitochondria, is tendentiously downregulated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and correlated with poor overall survival. LINC00493 is recognized by RNA-binding protein PABPC4 and transferred to ribosomes for translation of a 95-amino-acid protein SMIM26. SMIM26, but not LINC00493, suppresses ccRCC growth and metastatic lung colonization by interacting with acylglycerol kinase (AGK) and glutathione transport regulator SLC25A11 via its N-terminus. This interaction increases the mitochondrial localization of AGK and subsequently inhibits AGK-mediated AKT phosphorylation. Moreover, the formation of the SMIM26-AGK-SCL25A11 complex maintains\nplays an antagonistic role to Tom5 and Tom6 at the early stage of Tom40 assembly at the SAM complex. Second, Tom7 interacts with Mdm10 that is not bound to the SAM complex, and thus promotes dissociation of the SAM-Mdm10 complex. Since the SAM-Mdm10 complex is required for the biogenesis of Tom22, Tom7 delays the assembly of Tom22 with Tom40 at a late stage of assembly of the TOM complex. Thus, Tom7 modulates the biogenesis of topologically different proteins, the \u03b2-barrel forming protein Tom40 and Tom22 that contains a transmembrane \u03b1-helix.\nfusion. However, its mechanism is poorly described at the molecular level. Here, we determine the molecular architecture of the yeast exocyst complex by an integrative approach, based on a 3D density map from negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) at ~16 \u00c5 resolution, 434 disuccinimidyl suberate and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride cross-links from chemical-crosslinking mass spectrometry, and partial atomic models of the eight subunits. The integrative structure is validated by a previously determined cryo-EM structure, cross-links, and distances from in vivo fluorescence microscopy. Our subunit configuration is consistent with the cryo-EM structure, except for Sec5. While not observed in the cryo-EM map, the integrative model localizes the N-terminal half of Sec3 near the Sec6 subunit. Limited proteolysis experiments suggest that the conformation of Exo70 is dynamic, which may have functional implications for SNARE and membrane interactions. This study illustrates how integrative modeling based on varied low-resolution structural data can inform biologically relevant hypotheses, even\nthat deletion of the mouse Ezrin gene yields severe defects in apical integrity throughout the developing intestinal epithelium, resulting in incomplete villus morphogenesis and neonatal death. However, the molecular function of Ezrin in building the apical surface of the intestinal epithelium was not clear. By deleting Ezrin in the adult mouse intestinal epithelium, we provide evidence that Ezrin performs multiple molecular functions that collaborate to build the functional apical surface of the intestinal epithelium in vivo. The loss of Ezrin-mediated apical integrity in the adult intestine yields severe morphological consequences during intestinal homeostasis, including defects in cell geometry, extrusion, junctional remodeling, and spindle orientation. Surprisingly, deletion of Ezrin either before or after villus morphogenesis yields villus fusion, revealing a previously unrecognized step in intestinal homeostasis. Our studies indicate that the function of Ezrin in building and maintaining the apical domain is essential not only for intestinal morphogenesis but also for",

Finally, using the Stat5 GAS (gamma-activated sequence) element of the beta-casein gene promoter in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrate that PRL induces the SHP-2-Stat5a complex to bind to DNA. The presence of the phosphatase in the protein-bound DNA complex was verified by using polyclonal antisera to SHP-2. Our studies indicate a tight physical and functional interaction between SHP2 and Stat5 required for regulation and perpetuation of PRL-mediated signaling in mammary cells and suggest a potential role for SHP-2 in the nucleus. The protein tyrosine phosphatase PRL-2 interacts with the magnesium transporter CNNM3 to promote oncogenesis. The three PRL (phosphatases of regenerating liver) protein tyrosine phosphatases (PRL-1, -2 and -3) have been identified as key contributors to metastasis in several human cancers, yet\nmodulating intracellular magnesium levels through binding with the CNNM3 magnesium transporter. Interaction of farnesylated PRL-2, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase, with the beta-subunit of geranylgeranyltransferase II. Protein of regenerating liver (PRL)-1, -2, and -3 comprise a subgroup of closely related protein-tyrosine phosphatases featuring a C-terminal prenylation motif conforming to either the consensus sequence for farnesylation, CAAX, or geranylgeranylation, CCXX. Yeast two-hybrid screening for PRL-2-interacting proteins identified the beta-subunit of Rab geranylgeranyltransferase II (betaGGT II). The specific interaction of betaGGT II with PRL-2 but not with PRL-1 or -3 occurred in yeast and HeLa cells. Chimeric PRL-1/-2 molecules were tested for their interaction with betaGGT II, and revealed that the C-terminal region of PRL-2 is required for interaction, possibly the PRL variable region immediately preceeding the CAAX box. Additionally, PRL-2 prenylation is prequisite for betaGGT II binding. As prenylated PRL-2 is localized to the early endosome, we propose that this is where the\nvitro. Nuclear translocation of STAT5a and STAT5b was largely inhibited upon overexpression of PTP1B. The PRL-dependent transcriptional activation of the beta-casein gene promoter was also inhibited by PTP1B. Furthermore, retrovirus-mediated overexpression of PTP1B resulted in dephosphorylation of endogenous STAT5 and down-regulation of beta-casein gene expression in mammary epithelial COMMA-1D cells when the cells were treated with lactogenic hormones. Endogenous tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5 proteins in mammary epithelial COMMA-1D cells as well as tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5a and STAT5b expressed in COS7 cells were co-precipitated by substrate-trapping mutants of recombinant PTP1B. These results strongly suggest that PTP1B dephosphorylates PRL-activated STAT5a and STAT5b, thereby negatively regulating PRL-mediated signaling pathway. Identification of proteins suppressing the functions of oncogenic phosphatase of regenerating liver 1 and 3. The phosphatase of regenerating liver (PRL) family, including PRL-1, PRL-2, and PRL-3, comprises protein tyrosine phosphatases whose deregulation is associated with the tumorigenesis and metastasis of many types of cancer. However, the\nas a control. The dominant negative mutant of SHP-2 was found to inhibit the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA-binding activity of m-Stat5a, m-Stat5b, and the carboxyl-terminal deletion variant m-Stat5adelta749, as well as the transactivation potential of m-Stat5a and m-Stat5b. The dominant negative mutant SHP-1(SH2)2 had no effect. The kinase activity of Jak2 is also dependent on a functional SHP-2 phosphatase. We propose that SHP-2 relieves an inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation event in Jak2 required for Jak2 activity, Stat5 phosphorylation, and transcriptional induction. PRL-3 promotes the motility, invasion, and metastasis of LoVo colon cancer cells through PRL-3-integrin beta1-ERK1/2 and-MMP2 signaling. BACKGROUND: Phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 (PRL-3) plays a causative role in tumor metastasis, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In our previous study, we observed that PRL-3 could decrease tyrosine phosphorylation of integrin beta1 and enhance activation of ERK1/2 in HEK293 cells. Herein we aim to explore the association\nstudy of monodimensional gel electrophoresis of immunoprecipitates from PRL-3-transfected SW480 cells and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis, nucleolar-specific protein nucleolin (NCL) was identified as a novel PRL-3-binding protein. We confirmed physiological interaction between PRL-3 and NCL, and found that PRL-3 phosphatase activity was associated with the suppression of the phospho-NCL levels and nucleolar assembly of NCL protein. In CRC cases, nucleolar NCL expression was correlated not only with higher levels of PRL-3 expression but also with frequent incidence of lymph node metastasis and a higher clinicopathologic stage. These findings suggest that NCL is involved in PRL-3-mediated cancer progression/metastasis signaling, which plays an important role in the acceleration of CRC growth. Dominant negative variants of the SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase inhibit prolactin activation of Jak2 (janus kinase 2) and induction of Stat5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5)-dependent transcription. PRL plays a central role in the regulation of milk protein gene expression\na protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) that is frequently overexpressed in liver metastases of colorectal carcinomas (CRCs). The PTP activity of the PRL-3 protein is indispensable for the promotion of distant metastasis of CRC; however, little is known about the effect of PRL-3 on cell growth. In this study, we investigated a novel protein that can connect to PRL-3 to modulate the proliferation of CRC cells. In CRC-derived SW480 cells, transduction of ectopic wild-type PRL-3, but not the C104S catalytic \"dead\" mutant, up-regulated cell proliferation and increased the population of cells at the S and G(2) /M phases. Also, inhibition of PTP activity of the PRL-3 protein by treatment with the PRL-3 inhibitor suppressed cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner as well as PRL-3 knockdown by RNA interference. Using a comparative study of monodimensional gel electrophoresis of immunoprecipitates from PRL-3-transfected SW480 cells and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis, nucleolar-specific protein nucleolin (NCL)\ntransducer and activator of transcription 5)-dependent transcription. PRL plays a central role in the regulation of milk protein gene expression in mammary epithelial cells and in the growth and differentiation of lymphocytes. It confers its activity through binding to a specific transmembrane, class I hematopoietic receptor. Ligand binding leads to receptor dimerization and activation of the tyrosine kinase Jak (janus kinase) 2, associated with the membrane-proximal, intracellular domain of the receptor. Jak2 phosphorylates and activates Stat5, a member of the Stat (signal transducers and activators of transcription) family. PRL receptor also activates SHP-2, a cytosolic tyrosine phosphatase. We investigated the connection between these two signaling events and derived a dominant negative mutant of SHP-2 comprising the two SH2 domains [SHP-2(SH2)2]. An analogous variant of the SHP-1 phosphatase [SHP-1(SH2)2] was used as a control. The dominant negative mutant of SHP-2 was found to inhibit the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA-binding\nPTP4A1 and its close homolog PTP4A2 are critical promoters of TGF\u03b2 signaling in primary dermal fibroblasts and of bleomycin-induced fibrosis in vivo. PTP4A1 promotes TGF\u03b2 signaling in human fibroblasts through enhancement of ERK activity, which stimulates SMAD3 expression and nuclear translocation. Upstream from ERK, we show that PTP4A1 directly interacts with SRC and inhibits SRC basal activation independently of its phosphatase activity. Unexpectedly, PTP4A2 minimally interacts with SRC and does not promote the SRC-ERK-SMAD3 pathway. Thus, in addition to defining PTP4A1 as a molecule of interest for TGF\u03b2-dependent fibrosis, our study provides information regarding the functional specificity of different members of the PTP4A subclass of phosphatases. Requirement of phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 for the nucleolar localization of nucleolin during the progression of colorectal carcinoma. Phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 (PRL-3) is a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) that is frequently overexpressed in liver metastases of colorectal carcinomas (CRCs). The PTP activity of\nProlactin induces SHP-2 association with Stat5, nuclear translocation, and binding to the beta-casein gene promoter in mammary cells. The Src homology 2 (SH2) domain containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 contributes to prolactin receptor (PRLR) signal transduction to beta-casein gene promoter activation. We report for the first time that SHP-2 physically associates with the signal transducer and activator of transcription-5a (Stat5a), an important mediator of PRLR signaling to milk protein gene activation, in the mouse mammary HC11 and the human breast cancer T47D cells when stimulated with prolactin (PRL) and human growth hormone, respectively. In addition, overexpression studies indicate that the carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-2 is required to maintain tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 and its interaction with SHP-2. Furthermore, we demonstrate by nuclear co-immunoprecipitation and indirect immunofluorescence studies that PRL stimulation of mammary cells leads to the nuclear translocation of SHP-2 as a complex with Stat5a. This process was found to\nprotein 1 light chain 3; MEF: mouse embryonic fibroblast; PLAA: phospholipase A2, activating protein; PTP4A2: protein tyrosine phosphatase 4a2; PUB: NGLY1/PNGase/UBA- or UBX-containing protein; PUL: PLAP, Ufd3, and Lub1; TFEB: transcription factor EB; UBXN6/UBXD1: UBX domain protein 6; UPS: ubiquitin-proteasome system; VCP/p97: valosin containing protein; VCPIP1: valosin containing protein interacting protein 1; YOD1: YOD1 deubiquitinase.\ncomprises protein tyrosine phosphatases whose deregulation is associated with the tumorigenesis and metastasis of many types of cancer. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, aiming to increase understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of PRL-1 and PRL-3, a yeast two-hybrid system was employed to screen for their interacting proteins. Alignment with the NCBI BLAST database revealed 12 interactive proteins: Synaptic nuclear envelope protein 2, emerin, mannose 6-phosphate receptor-binding protein 1, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 10, Rab acceptor 1, tumor protein D52-like 2, selectin P ligand (SELPLG), guanylate binding protein 1, transmembrane and ubiquitin-like domain-containing 2, NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B8, syndecan 4 and FK506-binding protein 8 (FKBP8). These proteins are associated with cell proliferation, apoptosis, immune response, cell fate specification and metabolic process in biological process categories, and involved in various signaling pathways, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and cell adhesion\nfor betaGGT II binding. As prenylated PRL-2 is localized to the early endosome, we propose that this is where the interaction occurs. PRL-2 is not a substrate for betaGGT II, as isoprenoid analysis showed that PRL-2 was solely farnesylated in vivo. Co-expression of the alpha-subunit (alpha) of GGT II, betaGGT II, and PRL-2 resulted in alpha/betaGGT II heterodimer formation and prevented PRL-2 binding. Expression of PRL-2 alone inhibited the endogenous alpha/betaGGT II activity in HeLa cells. Together, these results indicate that the binding of alphaGGT II and PRL-2 to betaGGT II is mutually exclusive, and suggest that PRL-2 may function as a regulator of GGT II activity. A cytosolic protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B specifically dephosphorylates and deactivates prolactin-activated STAT5a and STAT5b. Prolactin (PRL) plays a central and crucial role in the regulation of milk protein gene expression in mammary epithelial cells. PRL binding to its cognate receptor leads to receptor dimerization\nregulation of milk protein gene expression in mammary epithelial cells. PRL binding to its cognate receptor leads to receptor dimerization and activation of the tyrosine kinase Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), associated with the membrane-proximal, intracellular domain of the receptor. In turn, JAK2 phosphorylates and activates STAT5, a member of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family. We have recently reported that 16 different protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) were expressed in lactating mouse mammary gland and mammary epithelial cells (Aoki, N., Kawamura, M., Yamaguchi-Aoki, Y., Ohira, S., and Matsuda, T. (1999) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 125, 669-675). We investigated the involvement of each PTP in PRL signaling. Among the 12 phosphatases including SHP-2 examined, a cytosolic phosphatase PTP1B was found to specifically dephosphorylate STAT5a and STAT5b in transfected COS7 and in vitro. Nuclear translocation of STAT5a and STAT5b was largely inhibited upon overexpression of PTP1B. The PRL-dependent transcriptional activation of the\nprotein tyrosine phosphatases (PRL-1, -2 and -3) have been identified as key contributors to metastasis in several human cancers, yet the molecular basis of their pro-oncogenic property is unclear. Among the subfamily of PRL phosphatases, overexpression of PRL-2 in breast cancer cells has been shown to promote tumor growth by a mechanism that remains to be uncovered. Here we show that PRL-2 regulates intracellular magnesium levels by forming a functional heterodimer with the magnesium transporter CNNM3. We further reveal that CNNM3 is not a phosphorylated substrate of PRL-2, and that the interaction occurs through a loop unique to the CBS pair domains of CNNM3 that exists only in organisms having PRL orthologs. Supporting the role of PRL-2 in cellular magnesium transport is the observation that PRL-2 knockdown results in a substantial decrease of cellular magnesium influx. Furthermore, in PRL-2 knockout mice, serum magnesium levels were significantly elevated as compared with\nsubstantial decrease of cellular magnesium influx. Furthermore, in PRL-2 knockout mice, serum magnesium levels were significantly elevated as compared with control animals, indicating a pivotal role for PRL-2 in regulating cellular magnesium homeostasis. Although the expression levels of CNNM3 remained unchanged after magnesium depletion of various cancer cell lines, the interaction between endogenous PRL-2 and CNNM3 was markedly increased. Importantly, xenograft tumor assays with CNNM3 and a mutant form that does not associate with PRL-2 confirm that CNNM3 is itself pro-oncogenic, and that the PRL-2/CNNM3 association is important for conferring transforming activities. This finding is further confirmed from data in human breast cancer tissues showing that CNNM3 levels correlate positively with both PRL-2 expression and the tumor proliferative index. In summary, we demonstrate that oncogenic PRL-2 controls tumor growth by modulating intracellular magnesium levels through binding with the CNNM3 magnesium transporter. Interaction of farnesylated PRL-2, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase, with the\nPtp4a2 in vivo compromises the recovery of glycerol-injection induced acute kidney injury due to impaired lysophagy and sustained lysosomal damage. Taken together, our data establish PTP4A2 as a critical regulator of VCP and uncover an important role for PTP4A2 in maintaining lysosomal homeostasis through dephosphorylation of VCP at Tyr805. Our study suggests that PTP4A2 targeting could be a potential therapeutic approach to treat cancers and other degenerative diseases by modulating lysosomal homeostasis and macroautophagy/autophagy.Abbreviations: AAA+: ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities; AKI: acute kidney injury; CBB: Coomassie Brilliant Blue; CRISPR: clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats; ELDR: endo-lysosomal damage response; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GST: \u200eglutathione S-transferase; IHC: immunohistochemistry; IP: immunoprecipitation; LAMP1: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1; LC-MS: liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; LGALS3/Gal3: galectin 3; LLOMe: L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MEF: mouse embryonic fibroblast; PLAA: phospholipase A2, activating protein; PTP4A2: protein tyrosine phosphatase 4a2; PUB:\nprocess categories, and involved in various signaling pathways, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and cell adhesion molecules. Interactions of PRL-1 with the prey proteins SELPLG and FKBP8 were confirmed by immunoprecipitation or immunostaining. Furthermore, SELPLG and FKBP8 suppressed PRL-1- or PRL-3-mediated p53 activity. Identification of the proteins interacting with PRL family proteins may provide valuable information to better understand the mechanism of PRL-mediated signal transduction in cancer and other diverse diseases. PTP4A1 promotes TGF\u03b2 signaling and fibrosis in systemic sclerosis. Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis of skin and internal organs. Protein tyrosine phosphatases have received little attention in the study of SSc or fibrosis. Here, we show that the tyrosine phosphatase PTP4A1 is highly expressed in fibroblasts from patients with SSc. PTP4A1 and its close homolog PTP4A2 are critical promoters of TGF\u03b2 signaling in primary dermal fibroblasts and of bleomycin-induced fibrosis\ntyrosine phosphorylation of integrin beta1 and enhance activation of ERK1/2 in HEK293 cells. Herein we aim to explore the association of PRL-3 with integrin beta1 signaling and its functional implications in motility, invasion, and metastasis of colon cancer cell LoVo.METHODS: Transwell chamber assay and nude mouse model were used to study motility and invasion, and metastsis of LoVo colon cancer cells, respectively. Knockdown of integrin beta1 by siRNA or lentivirus were detected with Western blot and RT-PCR. The effect of PRL-3 on integrin beta1, ERK1/2, and MMPs that mediate motility, invasion, and metastasis were measured by Western blot, immunofluorencence, co-immunoprecipitation and zymographic assays.RESULTS: We demonstrated that PRL-3 associated with integrin beta1 and its expression was positively correlated with ERK1/2 phosphorylation in colon cancer tissues. Depletion of integrin beta1 with siRNA, not only abrogated the activation of ERK1/2 stimulated by PRL-3, but also abolished PRL-3-induced motility and invasion of LoVo cells\nnot only abrogated the activation of ERK1/2 stimulated by PRL-3, but also abolished PRL-3-induced motility and invasion of LoVo cells in vitro. Similarly, inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation with U0126 or MMP activity with GM6001 also impaired PRL-3-induced invasion. In addition, PRL-3 promoted gelatinolytic activity of MMP2, and this stimulation correlated with decreased TIMP2 expression. Moreover, PRL-3-stimulated lung metastasis of LoVo cells in a nude mouse model was inhibited when integrin beta1 expression was interfered with shRNA.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that PRL-3's roles in motility, invasion, and metastasis in colon cancer are critically controlled by the integrin beta1-ERK1/2-MMP2 signaling. PTP4A2 promotes lysophagy by dephosphorylation of VCP/p97 at Tyr805. Overexpression of PTP4A phosphatases are associated with advanced cancers, but their biological functions are far from fully understood due to limited knowledge about their physiological substrates. VCP is implicated in lysophagy via collaboration with specific cofactors in the ELDR complex. However, how the\ntheir physiological substrates. VCP is implicated in lysophagy via collaboration with specific cofactors in the ELDR complex. However, how the ELDR complex assembly is regulated has not been determined. Moreover, the functional significance of the penultimate and conserved Tyr805 phosphorylation in VCP has not been established. Here, we use an unbiased substrate trapping and mass spectrometry approach and identify VCP/p97 as a bona fide substrate of PTP4A2. Biochemical studies show that PTP4A2 dephosphorylates VCP at Tyr805, enabling the association of VCP with its C-terminal cofactors UBXN6/UBXD1 and PLAA, which are components of the ELDR complex responsible for lysophagy, the autophagic clearance of damaged lysosomes. Functionally, PTP4A2 is required for cellular homeostasis by promoting lysophagy through facilitating ELDR-mediated K48-linked ubiquitin conjugate removal and autophagosome formation on the damaged lysosomes. Deletion of Ptp4a2 in vivo compromises the recovery of glycerol-injection induced acute kidney injury due to impaired lysophagy and sustained lysosomal damage.",

The recombinant OfHex1, characterized as a homodimer with molecular weight of 130 kDa, exhibited the same enzymatic activities as its native form, which could efficiently degrade the chitooligosaccharide substrate (GlcNAc)2 and release 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) from substrates, 4MU-beta-GlcNAc and 4MU-beta-GalNAc. This work provides a low-costing and high-efficient purification procedure for the preparation of insect beta-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidases. Interrelationship of hexosaminidases A and B: conformation of the common and the unique subunit theory. Human kidney hexosaminidase A (beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase; 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucoside acetamidodeoxyglucohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.30) is a heteropolymer of two immunologically distinct subunits designated as alpha and beta. Hexosaminidase B, however, is a homopolymer comprised entirely of beta subunits. When human kidney hexosaminidase A was dissociated into its subunits by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, three distinct proteins having isoelectric points of pH 7.2.5.4, and\ncutting one beta-GlcNAc unit once from the nonreducing ends of substrates, with a preference for shorter substrates. OfHex1 could hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl beta-GlcNAc, p-nitrophenyl beta-GalNAc and chito-oligosaccharides (degree of polymerization from 2 to 6), but it could not hydrolyze the complex N-glycan substrate (GlcNAc beta-1,2Man alpha-1,6)(GlcNAc beta-1,2Man alpha-1,3)Man beta-1,4GlcNAc beta-1,4GlcNAc-PA as well as the long polymer chitin. Certain structural elements of substrates, the 2-acetamido group and the beta-glycoside bond linkage, were determined to be essential for its activity. The 2.6 kb cDNA encoding OfHex1 was obtained by RT-PCR. Sequence analysis indicated that it was different from reported beta-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidases with N-glycan hydrolytic activities. Real-time PCR determined that its transcriptional level increased dramatically before the molting stage. According to its hydrolytic mode, substrate spectrum, cDNA sequence and mRNA transcriptional level, we deduced that OfHex1 could be mostly involved in insect chitin catabolism and might be a specific target for pesticide development. Expression, purification\nOfHex1 could be mostly involved in insect chitin catabolism and might be a specific target for pesticide development. Expression, purification and characterization of the chitinolytic beta-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase from the insect Ostrinia furnacalis. Insect beta-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidases are of particular interest due to their multiple physiological roles in many life processes. Chitinolytic beta-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidases, which function only in chitin degradation in insects, have long been regarded as species-specific target potentials in developing environmental friendly pesticides. Here the chitinolytic beta-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase from the insect Ostrinia furnacalis was cloned and expressed in the yeast strain, Pichia pastoris, to meet the demands of biochemical studies and drug development. Enzymatic assay as well as Western blot confirmed that the high-level expression could be achieved after the induction of methanol for 120 h. Through the sequential combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, metal chelating chromatography as well as anion exchange chromatography, 7.7 mg of the recombinant OfHex1 with high purity was obtained\nspecialized function of \u03b2-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase as well as making the development of species-specific pesticides a likely reality. A novel beta-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase from the insect Ostrinia furnacalis (Guen\u00e9e). Exploiting specific targets is of specific interest in developing eco-friendly pesticides. We isolated, purified and characterized a novel beta-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase (OfHex1) from the fifth instar larva integument of the Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis (Guen\u00e9e). OfHex1 was purified 1468-fold to homogeneity with an activity yield of 20% by four column chromatography steps. Under denaturing conditions, the molecular mass of OfHex1 was determined to be 67.0 kDa by MS and SDS/PAGE, but 128 kDa by gel filtration chromatography, suggesting that it was in the form of a homodimer. Its pI was 4.7 as determined by IEF electrophoresis. OfHex1 was shown to be an exo-splitting enzyme, acting by cutting one beta-GlcNAc unit once from the nonreducing ends of substrates, with a preference for shorter substrates. OfHex1 could hydrolyze\nto 'hit two birds with one stone', which maybe become a novel strategy in pest control. Structural determinants of an insect beta-N-Acetyl-D-hexosaminidase specialized as a chitinolytic enzyme. \u03b2-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase has been postulated to have a specialized function. However, the structural basis of this specialization is not yet established. OfHex1, the enzyme from the Asian corn borer Ostrinia furnacalis (one of the most destructive pests) has previously been reported to function merely in chitin degradation. Here the vital role of OfHex1 during the pupation of O. furnacalis was revealed by RNA interference, and the crystal structures of OfHex1 and OfHex1 complexed with TMG-chitotriomycin were determined at 2.1 \u00c5. The mechanism of selective inhibition by TMG-chitotriomycin was related to the existence of the +1 subsite at the active pocket of OfHex1 and a key residue, Trp(490), at this site. Mutation of Trp(490) to Ala led to a 2,277-fold decrease in sensitivity toward TMG-chitotriomycin\nOfHex1 was built through the ligand-supported homology modeling approach. The binding modes of its substrate and inhibitor were proposed through docking and cluster analysis. The pocket's size and shape of OfHex1 differ from that of human \u03b2-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase, which determined that allosamidin can selectively inhibit OfHex1 instead of human \u03b2-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase. Moreover, the multi-target characteristics of allosamidin that inhibit enzymes from different families, OfHex1 (EC 3.2.1.52; GH20) and chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14; GH18), were compared. The common -1/+1 sugar-binding site of chitinase and OfHex1, and the -2/-3 sugar-binding site in chitinase contribute to the binding of allosamidin. This work, at molecular level, proved that OfHex1 could be a potential species-specific target for novel green pesticide design and also provide the possibility to develop allosamidin or its derivatives as a new type of insecticide to 'hit two birds with one stone', which maybe become a novel strategy in pest control. Structural determinants of an\nkey residue, Trp(490), at this site. Mutation of Trp(490) to Ala led to a 2,277-fold decrease in sensitivity toward TMG-chitotriomycin as well as an 18-fold decrease in binding affinity for the substrate (GlcNAc)(2). Although the overall topology of the catalytic domain of OfHex1 shows a high similarity with the human and bacterial enzymes, OfHex1 is distinguished from these enzymes by large conformational changes linked to an \"open-close\" mechanism at the entrance of the active site, which is characterized by the \"lid\" residue, Trp(448). Mutation of Trp(448) to Ala or Phe resulted in a more than 1,000-fold loss in enzyme activity, due mainly to the effect on k(cat). The current work has increased our understanding of the structure-function relationship of OfHex1, shedding light on the structural basis that accounts for the specialized function of \u03b2-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase as well as making the development of species-specific pesticides a likely reality. A novel beta-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase from\nDynamic O-glycosylation of nuclear and cytosolic proteins: further characterization of the nucleocytoplasmic beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, O-GlcNAcase. beta-O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is an abundant and dynamic post-translational modification implicated in protein regulation that appears to be functionally more similar to phosphorylation than to classical glycosylation. There are nucleocytoplasmic enzymes for the attachment and removal of O-GlcNAc. Here, we further characterize the recently cloned beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, O-GlcNAcase. Both recombinant and purified endogenous O-GlcNAcase rapidly release free GlcNAc from O-GlcNAc-modified peptide substrates. The recombinant enzyme functions as a monomer and has kinetic parameters (K(m) = 1.1 mm for paranitrophenyl-GlcNAc, k(cat) = 1 s(-1)) that are similar to those of lysosomal hexosaminidases. The endogenous O-GlcNAcase appears to be in a complex with other proteins and is predominantly localized to the cytosol. Overexpression of the enzyme in living cells results in decreased O-GlcNAc modification of nucleocytoplasmic proteins. Finally, we show that the enzyme is a substrate for caspase-3 but,\nresults in decreased O-GlcNAc modification of nucleocytoplasmic proteins. Finally, we show that the enzyme is a substrate for caspase-3 but, surprisingly, the cleavage has no effect on in vitro O-GlcNAcase activity. These studies support the identification of this protein as an O-GlcNAcase and identify important interactions and modifications that may regulate the enzyme and O-GlcNAc cycling. A modeling study for structure features of \u03b2-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase from Ostrinia furnacalis and its novel inhibitor allosamidin: species selectivity and multi-target characteristics. Insect \u03b2-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase, a chitin degrading enzyme, is physiologically important during the unique life cycle of the insect. OfHex1, a \u03b2-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase from the insect, Ostrinia furna, which was obtained by our laboratory (Gen Bank No.: ABI81756.1), was studied by molecular modeling as well as by molecular docking with its inhibitor, allosamidin. 3D model of OfHex1 was built through the ligand-supported homology modeling approach. The binding modes of its substrate and inhibitor were proposed through\nkidney hexosaminidase A was dissociated into its subunits by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, three distinct proteins having isoelectric points of pH 7.2.5.4, and 4.3 were isolated. The fraction having an isoelectric point of pH 7.2, designated as beta fraction, was electrophoretically and immunologically identical to hexosaminidase B and was enzymatically active. The proteins having isoelectric points of pH 5.4 and 4.3, designated as hexosaminidase Ai and alpha fractions, respectively, were enzymatically inactive and crossreacted with antiserum against hexosaminidase A and not with antiserum against hexosaminidase B. Upon incubation of p-hydroxymercuribenzoate-treated hexosaminidase A with dithiothreitol,, hexosaminidase A activity, as well as antigenicity, was regenerated, indicating that alpha and beta subunits hybridize to form hexosaminidase A. Antibodies raised in rabbits against beta fractions reacted with both hexosaminidase A and B, whereas the antibodies against alpha and hexosaminidase Ai fractions reacted only against hexosaminidase A. This would indicate that both fractions are composed only of subunits\nand hexosaminidase Ai fractions reacted only against hexosaminidase A. This would indicate that both fractions are composed only of subunits unique to hexosaminidase A. The molecular weights of alpha,beta, and hexosaminidase Ai fractions were estimated to be 47,000, 120,000, and 180,000 respectively, by Sephadex gel filtration. Upon urea-sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide electrophoresis, each of the three fractions dissociated into a single polypeptide having a molecular weight of approximately 18,000. It is concluded that p-hydroxymercuribenzoate dissociates hexosaminidase A, (alphabeta)3, into its subunits, and the beta subunits can reassociate to form relatively stable hexosaminidase B, (betabeta)3, while the alpha subunits reassociate in both the dimeric state, alpha2, and a polymeric state, alpha8.",

Therefore, when comparing or analyzing PTH-(1-84)/PTH-(7-84) ratios, the employed PTH assays must be identical. The whole PTH assay and the PTH-(1-84)/PTH-(7-84) ratio allow more meaningful interpretation of PTH trends, and offer a non-invasive means to more accurately diagnose bone disease in this population. Structural and functional characterization of peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase from Klebsiella pneumoniae. Klebsiella pneumoniae is a member of the ESKAPE panel of pathogens that are top priority to tackle AMR. Bacterial peptidyl tRNA hydrolase (Pth), an essential, ubiquitous enzyme, hydrolyzes the peptidyl-tRNAs that accumulate in the cytoplasm because of premature termination of translation. Pth cleaves the ester bond between 2' or 3' hydroxyl of the ribose in the tRNA and C-terminal carboxylate of the peptide, thereby making free tRNA available for repeated cycles of protein synthesis and preventing cell death by alleviating tRNA starvation. Pth structures have been\nwith biological effects opposite to those of hPTH(1-84) was believed to explain their limitations, particularly in renal failure, and prompted the evolution of a third generation of PTH assays. The last is based on a 1-4 epitope to reveal PTH(1-84) and not hPTH(7-84). It also permits an indirect evaluation of non-(1-84) PTH fragments by subtracting a 3rd generation PTH value from a 2nd generation PTH value and the calculation of a PTH(1-84)/non-(1-84) PTH ratio. The combination of a third generation PTH value with the PTH(1-84)/non-(1-84) PTH ratio value has in some studies improved the differential diagnosis of bone diseases associated with renal failure. But more studies are required to see whether PTH(1-84)/PTH fragment ratios will improve the clinical performance of PTH concentrations used alone. Structural basis for the substrate recognition and catalysis of peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase. Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (Pth) cleaves the ester bond between the peptide and the tRNA of peptidyl-tRNA\nHigh-resolution crystal structure of peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase from Thermus thermophilus. Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (Pth) cleaves the ester bond between the peptide and the tRNA of peptidyl-tRNA molecules, which are the products of defective translation, to recycle the tRNA for further rounds of protein synthesis. Pth is ubiquitous in nature, and its activity is essential for bacterial viability. Here, we have determined the crystal structure of Pth from Thermus thermophilus (TtPth) at 1.00 \u00c5 resolution. This is the first structure of a Pth from a thermophilic bacterium and the highest resolution Pth structure reported so far. The present atomic resolution data enabled the calculation of anisotropic displacement parameters for all atoms, which revealed the directionality of the fluctuations of key regions for the substrate recognition. Comparisons between TtPth and mesophilic bacterial Pths revealed that their structures are similar overall. However, the structures of the N- and C-terminal, loop-helix \u03b14, and helix \u03b16 regions\n7-84 PTH were given simultaneously, the 7-84 PTH decreased the phosphaturic response by 50.2% (P < 0.005). Finally, in surgically excised parathyroid glands from six uremic patients, we found that 44.1% of the total intracellular PTH was the non-PTH (1-84), most likely PTH 7-84.CONCLUSION: In patients with chronic renal failure, the presence of high circulating levels of non-1-84 PTH fragments (most likely 7-84 PTH) detected by the \"intact\" assay and the antagonistic effects of 7-84 PTH on the biological activity of 1-84 PTH explain the need of higher levels of \"intact\" PTH to prevent adynamic bone disease. Crystal structure of a human peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase reveals a new fold and suggests basis for a bifunctional activity. Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (Pth) activity releases tRNA from the premature translation termination product peptidyl-tRNA. Two different enzymes have been reported to encode such activity, Pth present in bacteria and eukaryotes and Pth2 present in archaea and\nhighest range (1.92 to 9.75; P < 0.001), and the C/T ratio had a higher range (1.69 to 6.11; P < 0.01) than the T/CA ratio (1.15 to 1.86). Human (h) PTH (1-84) represented 32.7 and 4.3% of circulating PTH in hypo- and hypercalcemic HPLC profiles, respectively. These numbers were 5 and 0.9% for amino-terminal (N)-PTH, an amino-terminal form of PTH distinct from hPTH (1-84), 7.3 and 6.8% for non-(1-84) PTH or large C-PTH fragments with a partially preserved N structure, and 54.9 and 88.1% for C-PTH fragments missing a N structure. The HPLC C-PTH fragments to hPTH (1-84) ratio had the most extensive range (1.67 to 20.58). Despite their quantitative differences, all ratios identified identical behavior of PTH fragments relative to PTH (1-84).CONCLUSIONS: PTH assay ratios are an adequate tool to investigate the modulation of PTH molecular forms, even if all PTH assays show some undesirable cross-reactivity with certain\ncardiomyocytes the effect of PTH can be antagonized by PTH-rP. This antagonism seems due to a hydrophobic replacement at position 29. Parathyroid hormone and its fragments in children with chronic renal failure. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) immunoradiometric assays (IRMA) exhibit cross-reactivity between 1-84 PTH and long carboxyl-terminal-PTH (C-PTH) molecules. C-PTH antagonizes the biological actions of 1-84 PTH and circulates in excess in chronic renal failure (CRF), partially explaining why supra-physiological PTH levels are recommended to maintain bone turnover. Furthermore, the ratio 1-84 PTH/C-PTH may be related to bone turnover. This study characterizes the 1-84 PTH/C-PTH ratio in children with varying severity of CRF and levels of PTH. Two hundred and forty-one children with CRF, managed with the aim of preventing the development of hyperparathyroidism, had PTH measured by 'intact' IRMA and a new more specific Cyclase-Activating-PTH (CAP) IRMA. C-PTH levels were calculated by subtracting CAP-IRMA from 'intact' IRMA. Fifty-three controls with\nand catalysis of peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase. Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (Pth) cleaves the ester bond between the peptide and the tRNA of peptidyl-tRNA molecules, which are produced by aborted translation, to recycle tRNA for further rounds of protein synthesis. Pth is ubiquitous in nature, and its enzymatic activity is essential for bacterial viability. We have determined the crystal structure of Escherichia coli Pth in complex with the tRNA CCA-acceptor-T\u03a8C domain, the enzyme-binding region of the tRNA moiety of the substrate, at 2.4 \u00c5 resolution. In combination with site-directed mutagenesis studies, the structure identified the amino acid residues involved in tRNA recognition. The structure also revealed that Pth interacts with the tRNA moiety through the backbone phosphates and riboses, and no base-specific interactions were observed, except for the interaction with the highly conserved base G53. This feature enables Pth to accept the diverse sequences of the elongator-tRNAs as substrate components. Furthermore, we propose an\nwithin 24 h (123 +/- 3%; means +/- S.D., n = 4). PTH-rP(7-34) (1 nm to 1 microm) failed to induce CK activity in cardiomyocytes. Given simultaneously, PTH-rP (1 mum) reduced the stimulation of CK activity by PTH(1-84), PTH(1-34), and PTH(28-48) by 94 +/- 9, 79 +/- 8, and 69 +/- 14%, respectively (means +/- S.D., n = 4). In contrast, PTH-rP(7-34) was sufficient to stimulate proliferation of chicken chondrocytes. Thus, PTH-rP exerts different effects on cardiomyocytes and classical target cells for PTH. A synthetic hybrid peptide was synthesized, [Ala29]PTH(28-48), in which alanine replaced glutamine at position 29, as in the PTH-rP molecule. In contrast to PTH(28-48), this mutated peptide [Ala29]PTH(28-48) had no intrinsic activity but antagonized the effect of PTH(1-84) and PTH(28-48) on cardiomyocytes. The results demonstrate that on cardiomyocytes the effect of PTH can be antagonized by PTH-rP. This antagonism seems due to a hydrophobic replacement at position\nwith chronic renal failure. Eventually, it was demonstrated that these assays, which used 13-34 epitopes, reacted with large C-PTH fragments having a partially preserved amino-terminal (N) structure, also called non-(1-84) PTH. These fragments accounted for up to 50% of I-PTH immunoreactivity in renal failure patients. hPTH(7-84), a surrogate of non-(1-84) PTH fragments, was demonstrated to cause hypocalcemia and to antagonize hPTH(1-34) and hPTH(1-84) calcemic effect in vivo and to inhibit bone resorption in vitro via a C-PTH receptor, different from the type I PTH/PTHrP receptor. This suggested a dual control of calcium concentration via N- and C-PTH molecular forms. This also explained why the ratio of C-PTH fragments/I-PTH was so well regulated both acutely and chronically in various experimental conditions. The fact that I-PTH assays detected circulating PTH molecular forms with biological effects opposite to those of hPTH(1-84) was believed to explain their limitations, particularly in renal failure, and prompted\nof PTH fragments/PTH(1-84) ratios derived from three generations of PTH assays. CONTEXT: The quantitative evaluation of circulating PTH peaks revealed by PTH assays after HPLC separation constitutes the best way to study the behavior of PTH molecular forms, but it is also impractical.OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the regulation of circulating PTH molecular forms by calcium through the use of PTH fragments/PTH (1-84) ratios derived from PTH assays with different specificities before and after HPLC separation of circulating PTH.DESIGN: CaCl2 and Na citrate were infused in eight volunteers. PTH was measured in serum and HPLC fractions at different calcium concentrations in PTH assays reacting with regions 1-2 (CA), 12-18 (T), and 65-69 (C) of the PTH structure.RESULTS: From hypo- to hypercalcemia, the C/CA ratio had the highest range (1.92 to 9.75; P < 0.001), and the C/T ratio had a higher range (1.69 to 6.11; P\nantagonizes the action of parathyroid hormone on adult cardiomyocytes. Ventricular cardiomyocytes have been identified as target cells for parathyroid hormone (PTH). A structurally related peptide hormone, parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTH-rP), is expressed in the heart. In the present study, it was investigated whether PTH-rP can mimic or modify effects of PTH on cardiomyocytes. The investigated effect was induction of creatine kinase (CK) activity, which is associated with cardiac hypertrophy. PTH and PTH-rP have a similar secondary structure within the active domain 28 34, with exception of amino acid 29. At this position the hydrophilic glutamine in the PTH molecule corresponds to hydrophobic alanine in the PTH-rP molecule. Synthetic PTH or PTH-rP peptides covering domain 28 34 and recombinant full-length PTH(1 84) were used. PTH(28 48) (100 nm) induced CK activity within 24 h (123 +/- 3%; means +/- S.D., n = 4). PTH-rP(7-34) (1 nm to 1 microm) failed to\nsignificance of which requires further investigation in children. Role of methionine 71 in substrate recognition and structural integrity of bacterial peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase. BACKGROUND: Bacterial peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (Pth) is an essential enzyme that alleviates tRNA starvation by recycling prematurely dissociated peptidyl-tRNAs. The specificity of Pth for N-blocked-aminoacyl-tRNA has been proposed to be contingent upon conserved residue N14 forming a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of the first peptide bond in the substrate. M71 is involved in forming a conserved hydrogen bond with N14. Other interactions facilitating this recognition are not known.METHODS: The structure, dynamics, and stability of the M71A mutant of Pth from Vibrio cholerae (VcPth) were characterized by X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, MD simulations and DSC.RESULTS: Crystal structure of M71A mutant was determined. In the structure, the dimer interface is formed by the insertion of six C-terminal residues of one molecule into the active site of another molecule. The side-chain\nfragments may exert a hypocalcemic effect by contributing to skeletal resistance to 1-84 PTH.METHODS: The dynamic secretion of both 1-84 PTH and non-1-84 PTH was evaluated during the induction of hypo- and hypercalcemia in eight hemodialysis patients.RESULTS: The basal ionized calcium concentration was 1.23 +/- 0.03 mmol/L at which time I-PTH, W-PTH, and non-1-84 PTH values were 276 +/- 78 pg/mL, 164 +/- 48 pg/mL, and 102 +/- 28 pg/mL, respectively. The induction of hypo- and hypercalcemic changes resulted in a sigmoidal response for all three PTH moieties, I-PTH, W-PTH, and non-1-84 PTH. During hypocalcemia, maximal values of W-PTH were greater than those of non-1-84 PTH. But during hypercalcemia, minimal values of W-PTH and non-1-84 PTH were similar. Neither the set points nor the basal/maximal ratios for W-PTH, I-PTH, and non-1-84 PTH were different. At the baseline ionized calcium concentration, the W-PTH (1-84 PTH)/non-1-84 PTH ratio was 1.53 +/- 0.15.\nnon-1-84 PTH were different. At the baseline ionized calcium concentration, the W-PTH (1-84 PTH)/non-1-84 PTH ratio was 1.53 +/- 0.15. Changes in ionized calcium resulted in a sigmoidal relationship with hypocalcemia, increasing this ratio to a maximum of 2.01 +/- 0.30 and hypercalcemia decreasing this ratio to a minimum of 1.18 +/- 0.15 (P < 0.01 vs baseline for both hypo- and hypercalcemia).CONCLUSION: Although acute changes in serum calcium produce similar secretory responses in 1-84 PTH and non-1-84 PTH, the secretory responses are not proportional for these PTH moieties. Changes in the serum calcium concentration modulate the ratio of 1-84 PTH/non-1-84 PTH in a sigmoidal pattern with hypocalcemia maximizing this ratio. Whether changes in the 1-84 PTH/non-1-84 PTH ratio specifically modulate the calcemic action and other biologic effects of 1-84 PTH remain to be determined. PTH revisited. Recent investigations of parathyroid hormone (PTH) have advanced our understanding of its circulating\na new more specific Cyclase-Activating-PTH (CAP) IRMA. C-PTH levels were calculated by subtracting CAP-IRMA from 'intact' IRMA. Fifty-three controls with normal renal function were also recruited. Mean 'intact' IRMA correlated with CAP-IRMA ( r=0.98), but was higher ( P<0.001). The mean 1-84 PTH/C-PTH ratio was lower than controls in dialysis patients ( P=0.022) and those with a glomerular filtration rate <30 ml/min per m(2 )( P=0.033). This ratio was comparable to controls when the PTH level was normal, but was lower with PTH levels outside the normal range ( P<0.01). These data suggest that CAP-IRMA gives a more accurate assessment of actual PTH levels than 'intact' IRMA in CRF. Maintenance of normal PTH levels throughout the course of CRF permits the maintenance of a normal 1-84 PTH/C-PTH ratio, the clinical significance of which requires further investigation in children. Role of methionine 71 in substrate recognition and structural integrity of bacterial\n0.001). Similar results were found in 14 renal transplant patients. In osteoblast-like cells, ROS 17.2, 1-84 PTH (10-8 mol/L) increased cAMP from 18.1 +/- 1.25 to 738 +/- 4.13 mmol/well. Conversely, the same concentration of 7-84 PTH had no effect. In parathyroidectomized rats fed a calcium-deficient diet, 7-84 PTH was not only biologically inactive, but had antagonistic effects on 1-84 PTH in bone. Plasma calcium was increased (0.65 mg/dL) two hours after 1-84 PTH treatment, while 7-84 PTH had no effect. When 1-84 PTH and 7-84 PTH were given simultaneously in a 1:1 molar ratio, the calcemic response to 1-84 PTH was decreased by 94%. In normal rats, the administration of 1-84 PTH increased renal fractional excretion of phosphate (11.9 to 27.7%, P < 0.001). However, when 1-84 PTH and 7-84 PTH were given simultaneously, the 7-84 PTH decreased the phosphaturic response by 50.2% (P < 0.005). Finally, in surgically\ntool to investigate the modulation of PTH molecular forms, even if all PTH assays show some undesirable cross-reactivity with certain circulating forms of PTH. Small Molecule Docking Supports Broad and Narrow Spectrum Potential for the Inhibition of the Novel Antibiotic Target Bacterial Pth1. Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolases (Pths) play ancillary yet essential roles in protein biosynthesis by recycling peptidyl-tRNA. In E. coli, inhibition of bacterial Pth1 leads to accumulation of peptidyl-tRNA, depletion of aminoacyl-tRNA, and cell death. Eukaryotes have multiple Pths and Pth1 knock out was shown to have no effect on viability in yeast. Thereby, bacterial Pth1 is a promising target for novel antibiotic development. With the abundance of Pth1 structural data, molecular docking was used for virtual screening of existing, commercially available antibiotics to map potential interactions with Pth enzymes. Overall, 83 compounds were docked to eight different bacterial Pth1 and three different Pth2 structures. A variety of compounds demonstrated\ntRNA available for repeated cycles of protein synthesis and preventing cell death by alleviating tRNA starvation. Pth structures have been determined in peptide-bound or peptide-free states. In peptide-bound state, highly conserved residues F67, N69 and N115 adopt a conformation that is conducive to their interaction with peptide moiety of the substrate. While, in peptide-free state, these residues move away from the catalytic center, perhaps, in order to facilitate release of hydrolysed peptide. Here, we present a novel X-ray crystal structure of Pth from Klebsiella pneumoniae (KpPth), at 1.89 \u00c5 resolution, in which out of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit, one reflects the peptide-bound while the other reflects peptide-free conformation of the conserved catalytic site residues. Each molecule of the protein has canonical structure with seven stranded \u03b2-sheet structure surrounded by six \u03b1-helices. MD simulations indicate that both the forms converge over 500 ns simulation to structures with wider\nonly the first six amino acids of the PTH molecule. Thus, this new IRMA assay (Whole PTH) measures only the biologically active 1-84 PTH molecule.METHODS: Using this new IRMA assay (Whole PTH) and the Nichols \"intact\" PTH assay, we compared the ability of each assay to recognize human PTH (hPTH) 1-84 and hPTH 7-84 and examined the percentage of non-1-84 PTH in circulation and in parathyroid glands. Possible antagonistic effects of the 7-84 PTH fragment on the biological activity of 1-84 PTH in rats were also tested.RESULTS: In 28 uremic patients, PTH values measured with the Nichols assay, representing a combined measurement of both hPTH 1-84 and hPTH 7-84, were 34% higher than with the Whole assay (hPTH 1-84 only); the median PTH was 523 versus 318 pg/mL (P < 0.001). Similar results were found in 14 renal transplant patients. In osteoblast-like cells, ROS 17.2, 1-84 PTH (10-8 mol/L) increased\nboth W-PTH and I-PTH concentrations was found in horses with N2HPT. In horses with CRF, W-PTH and I-PTH values were very low and no increase in I-PTH was observed.CONCLUSIONS: The W-PTH assay can be used for measurement of equine PTH.POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: The use of W-PTH assay is likely to improve the diagnosis of mineral metabolism in horses. Dynamics of PTH secretion in hemodialysis patients as determined by the intact and whole PTH assays. BACKGROUND: Renal hyperparathyroidism is assessed by measurement of parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. The intact PTH assay (I-PTH) not only reacts with 1-84 PTH but also with large, truncated fragments of non-1-84 PTH. Because the whole PTH assay (W-PTH) is specific for 1-84 PTH, non-1-84 PTH is determined by subtracting W-PTH from I-PTH values. These large circulating PTH fragments may exert a hypocalcemic effect by contributing to skeletal resistance to 1-84 PTH.METHODS: The dynamic secretion of both 1-84",

Cystinosis is an inherited lysosomal storage disease characterized by defective transport of cystine out of lysosomes. However, the causative gene, CTNS, encodes a seven transmembrane domain lysosomal protein, cystinosin, unrelated to known transporters. To investigate the molecular function of cystinosin, the protein was redirected from lysosomes to the plasma membrane by deletion of its C-terminal GYDQL sorting motif (cystinosin-DeltaGYDQL), thereby exposing the intralysosomal side of cystinosin to the extracellular medium. COS cells expressing cystinosin-DeltaGYDQL selectively take up L-cystine from the extracellular medium at acidic pH. Disruption of the transmembrane pH gradient or incubation of the cells at neutral pH strongly inhibits the uptake. Cystinosin-DeltaGYDQL is directly involved in the observed cystine transport, since this activity is highly reduced when the GYDQL motif is restored and is abolished upon introduction of a point mutation inducing early-onset cystinosis. We conclude\nmTORC1 Activator SLC38A9 Is Required to Efflux Essential Amino Acids from Lysosomes and Use Protein as a Nutrient Structures of bacterial homologues of SWEET transporters in two distinct conformations Cystinosin, the small GTPase Rab11, and the Rab7 effector RILP regulate intracellular trafficking of the chaperone-mediated autophagy receptor LAMP2A New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 Structures of cystinosin in lumen-open conformation (A) Crystal structure of cystinosin bound to nanobody P10.

The ribbon representation\nwhen the GYDQL motif is restored and is abolished upon introduction of a point mutation inducing early-onset cystinosis. We conclude that cystinosin represents a novel H(+)-driven transporter that is responsible for cystine export from lysosomes, and propose that cystinosin homologues, such as mammalian SL15/Lec35 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ERS1, may perform similar transport processes at other cellular membranes. Structure and Mechanism of Human Cystine Exporter Cystinosin Summary Lysosomal amino acid efflux by proton-driven transporters is essential for lysosomal homeostasis, amino acid recycling, mTOR signaling, and maintaining lysosomal pH. To unravel mechanisms of these transporters, we focus on cystinosin, a prototypical lysosomal amino acid transporter that exports cystine to the cytosol, where its reduction to cysteine supplies this limiting amino acid for diverse fundamental processes and controlling nutrient adaptation. Cystinosin mutations cause cystinosis, a devastating lysosomal storage disease. Here, we present structures of human cystinosin in lumen-open, cytosol-open, and cysteine-bound states, which\na crystallization chaperone, yielded crystals in lipidic cubic phase that diffracted X-rays to 3.4 \u00c5 resolution (Figure S2 and Table S1). Overall, cystinosin resembles a Sarracenia-like structure with the luminal N-terminal domain (NTD) protruding from the TMD (Figure 1A). Cystinosin\u2019s NTD adopts a \u03b2-sandwich fold, resembling an immunoglobulin domain. The TMD contains seven transmembrane (TM) helices. The N-terminal TMs 1\u20133 and C-terminal TMs 5\u20137 form two similar triple helix bundles (THB) that are connected by an inversion linker helix, TM4 (Figure 1B). A large solvent-accessible cavity opens on the luminal side and extends deep into the transporter, indicating a lumen-open conformation. In parallel, we pursued cryo-EM studies to investigate cystinosin\u2019s main conformational states. Cystinosin-binding antibody 3H5 fragments (Fab3H5) were generated to provide a fiducial mark to facilitate particle alignment. This allowed us to determine structures of wild-type (WT) human cystinosin in two conformational states (Figure S3 and Table S2). Cystinosin-Fab3H5\nunclear. In proliferating cells, lysosomal concentrations of amino acids are generally lower than whole cells, with one remarkable exception: cystine, the oxidized dimeric form of cysteine. Cystine is ~ 30-fold more concentrated in lysosomes compared to the cytosol, where it is quickly reduced into cysteine. Lysosomal cystine serves as the predominant reservoir for intracellular cysteine, the least abundant and often limiting amino acid. Cystine efflux is governed by the proton-coupled transporter cystinosin, which regulates the cytosolic level of cysteine for diverse fundamental processes, such as antioxidant glutathione synthesis and transfer RNA thiolation. During fasting, lysosomal cystine efflux mediated by cystinosin controls the cellular response to nutrient restriction through limiting TORC1 activity. Thus, cystinosin is crucial both for maintaining cystine and cysteine availability, and for regulating the response of signaling pathways to nutrient status. Cystinosin dysfunction leads to the accumulation of cystine inside lysosomes and causes cystinosis. Cystinosin is the founding\ndialyzed overnight in buffer containing 10 mM HEPES pH7.5 and 10 mM NaCl. Fab3H5 was further purified by a Hitrap Q column (Cytiva) and used for cryo-EM studies. Nanobody selection and purification Nanobody against human cystinosin was obtained through phage display following published protocols. Purified recombinant cystinosin with mutation of glycosylation sites (N36A, N41A, N51A, N66A, N84A, N104A and N107A) in the NTD was used to screen specific binders. After four rounds of selection, nanobody clones that bound to cystinosin were isolated and sequenced. Individual nanobody was expressed in E.coli BL21 (DE3) and purified by HisPur cobalt resin (ThermoScientific) according to the standard protocol. Purified nanobodies were assessed by their ability of cystinosin binding through both pull-down assay and analytical SEC. Selenomethionine (Se-Met) labeled nanobody was expressed according to a standard protocol. Nanobody P10 and Se-Met labeled P10 were purified similarly and used for co-crystallization with cystinosin. Crystallization and crystal\nto specifically analyze the function of the GYDQL motif. This chimeric protein was targeted to lysosomes in a manner similar to cystinosin and was partially mislocalized to the PM in AP-3 knockdown cells where it also accumulated in the trans-Golgi network and early endosomes. Together with the fact that the surface levels of cystinosin and of the CD63-GYDQL chimeric protein were not increased when clathrin-mediated endocytosis was impaired, our data show that the tyrosine-based motif of cystinosin is a 'strong' AP-3 interacting motif responsible for lysosomal targeting of cystinosin by a direct intracellular pathway. Severity of phenotype in cystinosis varies with mutations in the CTNS gene: predicted effect on the model of cystinosin. Infantile nephropathic cystinosis is a rare, autosomal recessive disease caused by a defect in the transport of cystine across the lysosomal membrane and characterized by early onset of renal proximal tubular dysfunction. Late-onset cystinosis, a rarer form\nopen conformation at the luminal side. A closed conformation on the cytosolic side in conjunction with an open conformation on the luminal side, matches well with a transporter in a lumen-open conformation. Therefore, the luminal gate mutations of cystinosin favor the lumen-open conformation. In contrast, cytosolic gate mutations, Q145A or Q284A, shifted the distance distribution of the cytosolic pair towards the longer distance and the luminal pair towards the shorter distance (Figure 5D and Figure S5A\u2013C), consistent with structural features of cystinosin in a cytosol-open conformation. Thus, cytosolic gate mutations favor a cytosol-open conformation. These results suggest interactions at either the luminal gate or the cytosolic gate can maintain or drive closure of the respective gate and play critical roles in conformational switch of cystinosin. pH-dependent conformational changes Cystinosin is a proton-coupled symporter that harnesses the lysosomal proton gradient to facilitate cystine efflux. In a cell-based uptake assay where cystinosin\na proton-coupled symporter that harnesses the lysosomal proton gradient to facilitate cystine efflux. In a cell-based uptake assay where cystinosin was redirected to plasma membrane, the uptake activity increases with a decrease of extracellular pH. To investigate how a proton is coupled to the conformational switch of cystinosin, we monitored distance distributions across ten titration steps between pH 5.0 and 9.5 (Figure 6A\u2013B and Figure S5D\u2013F). At a high pH, the long-distance distribution of the luminal pair and the short-distance distribution of the cytosolic pair indicates cystinosin is predominantly in a lumen-open conformation. As the pH decreased, the distance distribution of the cytosolic pair shifted towards the long distance while that of the luminal pair shifted towards the short distance, suggesting that protonation of cystinosin favors cytosol-open conformations. At a low pH, cystinosin is predominantly in a cytosol-open conformation. During the titration, the distance distributions of the luminal and cytosolic\nallowed us to determine structures of wild-type (WT) human cystinosin in two conformational states (Figure S3 and Table S2). Cystinosin-Fab3H5 purified at pH 7.5 yielded a lumen-open conformation structure at 3.4 \u00c5 resolution, which superimposes well onto the crystal structure (Figure 1C\u2013D). Our structures, derived with two distinct techniques, cross-validate each other. In contrast, cystinosin-Fab3H5 purified at pH 5.0 yielded a 3.2 \u00c5 resolution cytosol-open structure with pronounced conformational changes in the TMD that result in a large central cavity accessible from the cytosol (Figure 2A\u2013B). Structural comparisons with other transporters revealed that cystinosin\u2019s NTD shares a similar fold to that of Niemann-Pick protein C2 (Figure S4A). Cystinosin\u2019s TMD adopts a similar fold to eukaryotic SWEET sugar transporters and KDEL receptors, despite their low sequence similarity (~ 19% and ~ 23% identity to SWEET (PDB: 5CTG) and KDELR (PDB: 6I6B), respectively) and divergent functions (Figure S4C\u2013D). This supports previous predictions\nthese residues\u2019 proposed roles in shaping conformational transitions. Cystinosin and the Ragulator-Rag complex interaction Cystinosin regulates the mTOR pathway through its cystine transport activity and binding to the Ragulator-Rag complex, but the molecular basis for the engagement between cystinosin and the Ragulator-Rag complex is unclear. An intriguing observation was that the N288K substitution suppresses cystinosin\u2019s interaction with the Ragulator-Rag complex (also see Figure 7A). Based on our structures, N288 is located near the cytosolic end of TM5 and is not on the exterior surface of the protein. Conceivably, N288K may induce structural/conformational changes in cystinosin and impact its interaction with the Ragulator-Rag complex. We thus determined the cryo-EM structures of N288K at pH 5.0 and pH 7.5 (3.0 and 3.1 \u00c5 resolution, respectively) (Figure 7B and Figure S7).

For three patients, the age of onset of cystinosis was <7 years but the course of the disease was milder than the infantile nephropathic form. This suggests that the missense mutations found in these individuals allow production of functional protein and may also indicate regions of cystinosin which are not functionally important. Interaction between galectin-3 and cystinosin uncovers a pathogenic role of inflammation in kidney involvement of cystinosis. Inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of many disorders. However, the underlying mechanisms are often unknown. Here, we test whether cystinosin, the protein involved\nto nutrient status. Cystinosin dysfunction leads to the accumulation of cystine inside lysosomes and causes cystinosis. Cystinosin is the founding member of the PQ-loop transporter family, whose members are characterized by a pair of highly conserved proline-glutamine motifs. These transporters share limited sequence similarity with transporters of known structure. They shuttle amino acids across the lysosomal membrane, playing essential roles in supporting lysosome functions, maintaining amino acid homeostasis, and transducing nutrient signaling. Cystinosin is well conserved across species (Figure S1) and unique for its strict substrate selectivity for cystine. Other known lysosomal amino acid transporters, including other PQ-loop transporters, generally recognize a range of amino acids with overlapping properties. For example, PQLC2, mediates lysosomal efflux of cationic amino acids such as arginine, lysine, histidine, and ornithine. Yet the molecular determinants that underlie substrate selectivity and the transport cycle of cystinosin\u2014or any other PQ-loop transporters\u2014have remained obscure. Another key feature of\nof WT at pH 5.2. Hence, we postulate that D346 is a key protonation site for the proton-dependent conformational transition of cystinosin. To probe cystinosin\u2019s conformation under a condition that better mimics the lysosomal environment, we aimed to carry out DEER studies on cystinosin reconstituted into liposomes with asymmetric pH across the membrane. Given that cystinosin reconstituted into liposomes yielded a mixed orientation (Figure S6D), we developed a strategy to release spin labels on the liposome exterior with the mild and membrane-impermeable reducing reagent TCEP, which breaks the spin label disulfide attachment. As a result, subsequent to background correction, only proteins with spin labels on the liposome interior are EPR DEER detectable (Figure S6F). Under our experimental conditions, the reconstituted liposomes showed a proton gradient across the membrane (Figure S6B\u2013C) with negligible TCEP permeability (Figure S6E). Continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW-EPR) kinetic studies showed a bi-exponential release of free\nexpressed on the plasma membrane (except G337R and L338P, which cause protein destabilization/misfolding and show no detectable surface expression). Cell-surface expression of cystinosin mutants was assessed by anti-FLAG M1 antibody staining. At 24 hours post transfection, cells were washed twice with staining buffer (buffer A supplemented with 2mM CaCl2), then incubated with anti-FLAG M1 antibody labeled with Alexa647 (Alexa Fluor647 NHS Ester, Invitrogen) for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. To saturate cystinosin molecules on cell surface, 2.0\u00d7105 cells were stained with M1-647 antibody at a final concentration of 1 \u03bcM. After another two washes with ice-cold staining buffer, cells were analyzed by BD Accuri C6 Plus flow cytometer. Experiments were repeated three times and surface-expression levels of cystinosin variants were quantified by the mean fluorescence of Alexa647 (Figure S4H). To assess the biochemical behavior of cystinosin mutants, cells were solubilized for 1 hour at 4 \u00b0C in solution containing 20\ncaptured in cytosol-open and lumen-open states Cystine-bound structure and functional analyses demonstrate substrate selectivity DEER studies reveal proton-driven conformational changes Cystinosin engages the Ragulator-Rag components in a conformation-dependent manner Cystinosin is a Component of the Vacuolar H+-ATPase-Ragulator-Rag Complex Controlling Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 Signaling. Cystinosis is a rare autosomal recessive storage disorder characterized by defective lysosomal efflux of cystine due to mutations in the CTNS gene encoding the lysosomal cystine transporter, cystinosin. Lysosomal cystine accumulation leads to crystal formation and functional impairment of multiple organs. Moreover, cystinosis is the most common inherited cause of renal Fanconi syndrome in children. Oral cysteamine therapy delays disease progression by reducing intracellular cystine levels. However, because cysteamine does not correct all complications of cystinosis, including Fanconi syndrome, we hypothesized that cystinosin could have novel roles in addition to transporting cystine out of the lysosome. By coimmunoprecipitation experiments and mass spectrometry, we found\nprotein samples were purified similarly with minor changes. 100 mM cystine stock was made in 1 M HCl due to its low solubility in neutral pH conditions. Buffers were supplemented with 1mM cystine immediately prior to use, yielding a final pH of ~7.0. Cells were sonicated in lysis buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH8.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM cystine (Alfa Asar). The SEC buffer contained 20 mM HEPES pH8.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Cystine, and 0.06% Digitonin. To assemble cystinosin-Fab3H5 complex, purified cystinosin was incubated with Fab3H5 at a 1:1.5 molar ratio at 4 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. The mixture was then purified by SEC using the aforementioned buffers (Figure S3G). Peak fractions were collected and concentrated to ~5 mg/ml for grid preparation. Generation of anti-human cystinosin antibody 3H5 IgG-3H5, a mouse monoclonal anti-human cystinosin antibody, was prepared by fusion of SP2-mIL6 mouse myeloma cells (ATCC no.\nBuffer 5.2 and treated with TCEP at a cystinosin:TCEP molar ratio of 1:50. 100 mM TCEP solution was made in Buffer 5.2. The removal of exterior spin labels was monitored by EPR (Figure S6G\u2013H). After 6 hours, the exterior buffer of proteoliposomes was adjusted to pH 7.4 with 1M HEPES pH7.4. Samples were flash frozen at a protein concentration of 40 \u03bcM with 10% deuterated glycerol for DEER experiments. Deglycosylation assay Cystinosin is heavily glycosylated in the NTD. To determine the orientation of reconstituted cystinosin, 10\u201320 \u03bcg protein in liposomes were incubated with 50 units Endo D (NEB) at 37 \u00b0C for 3 hours. The reaction was stop by 4 \u00d7 SDS-loading buffer and protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel (Figure S6D). ACMA assay The assay was adapted from fluorescence-based ion flux assay (Figure S6B\u2013C). In brief, 2 \u03bcl of 100 \u03bcM cystinosin in pH 5.2 liposomes was added into\nstandard protocol. Nanobody P10 and Se-Met labeled P10 were purified similarly and used for co-crystallization with cystinosin. Crystallization and crystal structure determination. Cystinosin and nanobody P10 were incubated at a 1:1.5 molar ratio for 30 min and purified by SEC. Peak fractions containing cystinosin-P10 complex were concentrated to a final concentration of 60 mg/ml. Cystinosin-P10 complex was reconstituted into lipidic cubic phase (LCP) by mixing protein with monoolein (Sigma) at a 2:3 ratio (w/w). Crystals were grown in 12% PEG400, 80 mM Li2SO4, and 50 mM MES pH 6.0 at 20 \u00b0C. Diffraction data were collected from multiple crystals, processed with HKL2000, and merged using XDS. The initial molecular replacement was carried out using truncated and modified nanobody Nb80 and truncated and modified EcSemiSWEET as the search models in Phaser. For the complex with Se-Met nanobody, selenium atoms of Se-Met nanobody were located by MR-SAD in Phaser. Model building and",

MICU1 is associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane and has two canonical EF hands that are essential for its activity, indicating a role in calcium sensing. MICU1 represents the founding member of a set of proteins required for high-capacity mitochondrial calcium uptake. Its discovery may lead to the complete molecular characterization of mitochondrial calcium uptake pathways, and offers genetic strategies for understanding their contribution to normal physiology and disease. Crystal structure of calcium-free human sorcin: a member of the penta-EF-hand protein family. Sorcin is a 22 kD calcium-binding protein that is found in a wide variety of cell types, such as heart, muscle, brain and adrenal medulla. It belongs to the penta-EF-hand (PEF) protein family, which contains five EF-hand motifs that associate with\na multimolecular structure, the MCU complex, which differs among various tissues. Its activity is indeed controlled by different components that cooperate to modulate specific channeling properties. We here investigate the role of MICU3, an EF-hand containing protein expressed at high levels, especially in brain. We show that MICU3 forms a disulfide bond-mediated dimer with MICU1, but not with MICU2, and it acts as enhancer of MCU-dependent mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Silencing of MICU3 in primary cortical neurons impairs Ca2+ signals elicited by synaptic activity, thus suggesting a specific role in regulating neuronal function. Crystal structure of calpain-3 penta-EF-hand (PEF) domain - a homodimerized PEF family member with calcium bound at the fifth EF-hand. Calpains are Ca(2+) dependent intracellular cysteine proteases that cleave a wide range of protein substrates to help implement Ca(2+) signaling in the cell. The major isoforms of this enzyme family, calpain-1 and calpain-2, are heterodimers of a large\nthe matrix. MICU1 contains an EF-hand calcium binding domain and is found in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS), where it serves as a calcium-sensing gatekeeper, keeping the channel closed when calcium levels are low and opening the channel in response to transient rises. Its paralog and binding partner, MICU2, has not been extensively characterized. Other proteins, including leucine-zipper EF-hand containing transmembrane protein 1 (LETM1), mitochondrial calcium uniporter regulator 1 (MCUR1), mitochondrial sodium calcium exchanger (NCLX), transient receptor potential 3 (TRCP3), and uncoupling protein 2 and 3 (UPC2 and 3) are also crucial for mitochondrial calcium physiology, but their physical relation to the uniplex are unclear. We took a biochemical approach to fully characterize composition the uniporter complex. We stably expressed MCU tagged with the FLAG epitope at its carboxy terminus (MCU-FLAG) in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293T cells. MCU-FLAG restored mitochondrial calcium uptake in cells in which MCU was depleted with\nseparated by a cleft and their putative active sites can catalyze isomerazation of two bonds within a polypeptide chain in extended conformation. These structural results are of prime interest for understanding biological functions of ER resident FKBPs containing EF-hand motifs. The leucine zipper EF-hand containing transmembrane protein-1 EF-hand is a tripartite calcium, temperature, and pH sensor. Leucine Zipper EF-hand containing transmembrane protein-1 (LETM1) is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein that mediates mitochondrial calcium (Ca2+ )/proton exchange. The matrix residing carboxyl (C)-terminal domain contains a sequence identifiable EF-hand motif (EF1) that is highly conserved among orthologues. Deletion of EF1 abrogates LETM1 mediated mitochondrial Ca2+ flux, highlighting the requirement of EF1 for LETM1 function. To understand the mechanistic role of this EF-hand in LETM1 function, we characterized the biophysical properties of EF1 in isolation. Our data show that EF1 exhibits \u03b1-helical secondary structure that is augmented in the presence of Ca2+ .\npermeability transition pore (mPTP). Additionally, this review presents the use of advanced new methods that can be readily adapted by any investigator to enable them to carry out quantitative Ca2+ measurements in mitochondria while controlling the inner mitochondrial membrane potential, \u0394\u03a8m. FhCaBP2: a Fasciola hepatica calcium-binding protein with EF-hand and dynein light chain domains. FhCaBP2 is a Fasciola hepatica protein which belongs to a family of helminth calcium-binding proteins which combine an N-terminal domain containing two EF-hand motifs and a C-terminal dynein light chain-like (DLC-like) domain. Its predicted structure showed two globular domains joined by a flexible linker. Recombinant FhCaBP2 interacted reversibly with calcium and manganese ions, but not with magnesium, barium, strontium, copper (II), colbalt (II), iron (II), nickel, lead or potassium ions. Cadmium (II) ions appeared to bind non-site-specifically and destabilize the protein. Interaction with either calcium or magnesium ions results in a conformational change in which the\nscreen identifies Letm1 as a mitochondrial Ca2+/H+ antiporter NCLX is an essential component of mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange EMRE is an essential component of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex The mitochondrial uniporter is a highly selective calcium channel in the organelle\u2019s inner membrane. Its molecular components include the EF-hand containing proteins mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 (MICU1) and MICU2 and the pore forming subunit mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). We sought to achieve a full molecular characterization of the uniporter holocomplex (uniplex). Quantitative mass spectrometry of affinity-purified uniplex recovered MICU1 and MICU2, MCU and its paralog MCUb, and essential MCU regulator (EMRE), a previously uncharacterized protein. EMRE is a 10 kD, metazoan specific protein with a single transmembrane domain. In its absence, uniporter channel activity was lost despite intact MCU expression and oligomerization. EMRE was required for the interaction of MCU with MICU1 and MICU2. Hence, EMRE is essential for in vivo uniporter\ndomain would release the amphipathic \u03b1-helix. We propose a mechanism for ATP-Mg/Pi carriers in which the amphipathic \u03b1-helix becomes mobile upon release of calcium and could block the transport of substrates across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Graphical abstract Highlights The mechanism of calcium-regulation in the ATP-Mg/Pi carrier is unresolved. The human ATP-Mg/Pi carrier is monomeric in the presence and absence of calcium. In the presence of calcium an amphipathic \u03b1-helix binds in a cleft of EF-hand 3/4. Without calcium the amphipathic \u03b1-helix is released from the regulatory domain. Regulation could occur by the amphipathic \u03b1-helix blocking substrate translocation. Introduction The mitochondrial ATP-Mg/Pi carrier (APC) is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family of transport proteins. Mitochondrial carriers are typically located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and fulfil the vital role of shuttling nucleotides, amino acids, inorganic ions, keto acids, fatty acids and cofactors between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytosol.\nbrain and adrenal medulla. It belongs to the penta-EF-hand (PEF) protein family, which contains five EF-hand motifs that associate with membranes in a calcium-dependent manner. Prototypic members of this family are the calcium-binding domains of calpain, such as calpain dVI. Full-length human sorcin has been crystallized in the absence of calcium and the structure determined at 2.2 A resolution. Apart from an extended N-terminal portion, the sorcin molecule has a globular shape. The C-terminal domain is predominantly alpha-helical, containing eight alpha-helices and connecting loops incorporating five EF hands. Sorcin forms dimers through the association of the unpaired EF5, confirming this as the mode of association in the dimerization of PEF proteins. Comparison with calpain dVI reveals that the general folds of the individual EF-hand motifs are conserved, especially that of EF1, the novel EF-hand motif characteristic of the family. Detailed structural comparisons of sorcin with other members of PEF indicate\nA survey of the interaction of calcium ions with mitochondria from different tissues and species The mitochondrial calcium uniporter is a highly selective ion channel MICU1 encodes a mitochondrial EF hand protein required for Ca(2+) uptake Integrative genomics identifies MCU as an essential component of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter A forty-kilodalton protein of the inner membrane is the mitochondrial calcium uniporter Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake 1 (MICU1) and mitochondrial ca2+ uniporter (MCU) contribute to metabolism-secretion coupling in clonal pancreatic beta-cells MICU1 Is an Essential Gatekeeper for MCU-Mediated Mitochondrial Ca(2+) Uptake that Regulates Cell Survival Mitochondrial calcium uptake from physiological-type pulses of calcium.

Based on the identification of a conserved central substrate binding site flanked by two salt bridge networks on either side, an alternating access mechanism has been proposed for substrate transport through carrier proteins. The linker region between the N-terminal regulatory domain and the C-terminal carrier domain contains an amphipathic \u03b1-helix of unknown function. In the structure this \u03b1-helix is bound to EF-hand pair 3 and 4, analogous to the binding of a calmodulin recognition sequence motif to the hydrophobic pockets in the EF-hands of calmodulin. Another member of the carrier family of proteins, the aspartate/glutamate carrier (AGC), also displays a calcium-dependence for activity and has an N-terminal regulatory domain that contains EF-hands. Structures of both the calcium-bound and calcium-free states of the regulatory domain of\nEF1, the novel EF-hand motif characteristic of the family. Detailed structural comparisons of sorcin with other members of PEF indicate that the EF-hand pair EF1-EF2 is likely to correspond to the two physiologically relevant calcium-binding sites and that the calcium-induced conformational change may be modest and localized within this pair of EF-hands. Overall, the results derived from the structural observations support the view that, in sorcin, calcium signaling takes place through the first pair of EF-hands. MICU2, a Paralog of MICU1, Resides within the Mitochondrial Uniporter Complex to Regulate Calcium Handling Mitochondrial calcium uptake is present in nearly all vertebrate tissues and is believed to be critical in shaping calcium signaling, regulating ATP synthesis and controlling cell death. Calcium uptake occurs through a channel called the uniporter that resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Recently, we used comparative genomics to identify MICU1 and MCU as the key regulatory and putative\nand solute carriers, which are also involved in ion transport. Although the influx of Ca(2+) across the inner mitochondrial membrane maintains metabolic functions and cell death signal transduction, the mechanisms that regulate mitochondrial Ca(2+) accumulation are unclear. Solute carriers--solute carrier 25A23 (SLC25A23), SLC25A24, and SLC25A25--represent a family of EF-hand-containing mitochondrial proteins that transport Mg-ATP/Pi across the inner membrane. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of SLC25A23 but not SLC25A24 and SLC25A25 decreases mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake and reduces cytosolic Ca(2+) clearance after histamine stimulation. Ectopic expression of SLC25A23 EF-hand-domain mutants exhibits a dominant-negative phenotype of reduced mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake. In addition, SLC25A23 interacts with mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter (MCU; CCDC109A) and MICU1 (CBARA1) while also increasing IMCU. In addition, SLC25A23 knockdown lowers basal mROS accumulation, attenuates oxidant-induced ATP decline, and reduces cell death. Further, reconstitution with short hairpin RNA-insensitive SLC25A23 cDNA restores mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake and superoxide production. These findings indicate that SLC25A23 plays an\nprotein and to begin characterizing its Ca2+-dependent interaction with protein binding targets, the three-dimensional structure of mts1 was determined in the apo state by NMR spectroscopy. As with other S100 protein family members, mts1 is a symmetric homodimer held together by noncovalent interactions between two helices from each subunit (helices 1, 4, 1', and 4') to form an X-type four-helix bundle. Each subunit of mts1 has two EF-hand Ca2+-binding domains: a pseudo-EF-hand (or S100-hand) and a typical EF-hand that are brought into proximity by a small two-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. The S100-hand is formed by helices 1 and 2, and is similar in conformation to other members of the S100 family. In the typical EF-hand, the position of helix 3 is similar to that of another member of the S100 protein family, calcyclin (S100A6), and less like that of other S100 family members for which three-dimensional structures are available in the\nCrystal structure of human grancalcin, a member of the penta-EF-hand protein family. Grancalcin is a Ca(2+)-binding protein expressed at high level in neutrophils. It belongs to the PEF family, proteins containing five EF-hand motifs and which are known to associate with membranes in Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Prototypic members of this family are Ca(2+)-binding domains of calpain. Our recent finding that grancalcin interacts with L-plastin, a protein known to have actin bundling activity, suggests that grancalcin may play a role in regulation of adherence and migration of neutrophils. The structure of human grancalcin has been determined at 1.9 A resolution in the absence of calcium (R-factor of 0.212 and R-free of 0.249) and at 2. 5 A resolution in the presence of calcium (R-factor of 0.226 and R-free of 0.281). The molecule is predominantly alpha-helical: it contains eight alpha-helices and only two short stretches of two-stranded beta-sheets between the loops of paired\nwith short hairpin RNA-insensitive SLC25A23 cDNA restores mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake and superoxide production. These findings indicate that SLC25A23 plays an important role in mitochondrial matrix Ca(2+) influx. MICU1 encodes a mitochondrial EF hand protein required for Ca(2+) uptake. Mitochondrial calcium uptake has a central role in cell physiology by stimulating ATP production, shaping cytosolic calcium transients and regulating cell death. The biophysical properties of mitochondrial calcium uptake have been studied in detail, but the underlying proteins remain elusive. Here we use an integrative strategy to predict human genes involved in mitochondrial calcium entry based on clues from comparative physiology, evolutionary genomics and organelle proteomics. RNA interference against 13 top candidates highlighted one gene, CBARA1, that we call hereafter mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 (MICU1). Silencing MICU1 does not disrupt mitochondrial respiration or membrane potential but abolishes mitochondrial calcium entry in intact and permeabilized cells, and attenuates the metabolic coupling between cytosolic\nEMRE was required for the interaction of MCU with MICU1 and MICU2. Hence, EMRE is essential for in vivo uniporter current and additionally bridges the calcium-sensing role of MICU1 and MICU2 with the calcium conducting role of MCU. The mitochondrial calcium uniporter is a highly selective channel that moves calcium ions across mitochondrial inner membrane. Although its physiology has been studied for decades, a complete description of its molecular composition has remained elusive. Recently, integrative genomics methods enabled the discovery of the uniporter pore, mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), and its regulatory subunits, mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 and 2 (MICU1 and 2). MCU is an integral membrane protein that is essential for the electrophysiologically defined uniporter current; it has two transmembrane domains, and orients both its N and C termini into the matrix. MICU1 contains an EF-hand calcium binding domain and is found in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS), where it\nhave emerged more recently and represents a metazoan innovation. Its identification should help us understand how the activity and regulation of this ancient channel evolved.

Interaction with either calcium or magnesium ions results in a conformational change in which the protein's surface becomes more hydrophobic. The EF-hand domain alone was able to interact with calcium and manganese ions; the DLC-like domain was not. Alteration of a residue (Asp-58 to Ala) in the second EF-hand motif in this domain abolished ion-binding activity. This suggests that the second EF-hand is the one responsible for ion-binding. FhCaBP2 homodimerizes and the extent of dimerization was not affected by calcium ions or by the aspartate to alanine substitution in the second EF-hand. The isolated EF-hand and DLC-like domains are both capable of homodimerization. FhCaBP2 interacted with the calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine, chlorpromazine, thiamylal and W7. Interestingly, while chlorpromazine and thiamylal interacted with the EF-hand domain (as expected), trifluoperazine and W7 bound to the DLC-like domain.

Adaptability in herpesviruses: glycoprotein D-independent infectivity of pseudorabies virus. Initial contact between herpesviruses and host cells is mediated by virion envelope glycoproteins which bind to cellular receptors. In several alphaherpesviruses, the nonessential glycoprotein gC has been found to interact with cell surface proteoglycans, whereas the essential glycoprotein gD is involved in stable secondary attachment. In addition, gD is necessary for penetration, which involves fusion between virion envelope and cellular cytoplasmic membrane. As opposed to other alphaherpesvirus gD homologs, pseudorabies virus (PrV) gD is not required for direct viral cell-to-cell spread. Therefore, gD- PrV can be passaged in noncomplementing cells by cocultivating infected and noninfected cells. Whereas infectivity was found to be strictly cell associated in early passages, repeated passaging resulted in the appearance\nrole of individual glycoproteins in assembly has been difficult. To overcome this problem, a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein-binding assay was used in this study to test the interaction between the cytoplasmic tail of one specific viral glycoprotein, gD, and tegument proteins. The study demonstrated that the 38 kDa tegument protein VP22 bound specifically to the gD tail. This association was dependent on arginine and lysine residues at positions 5 and 6 in the gD tail. In addition, HSV-1 capsids bound the gD tail and exhibited a similar sequence dependence. It is concluded that VP22 may serve as a linker protein, mediating the interaction of the HSV capsid with gD. Disulfide bond structure of glycoprotein D of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Glycoprotein D (gD) is a structural component of the herpes simplex virus envelope which is essential for virus penetration. The function of this protein is highly dependent\nthat affect specific activities identify domains of gD involved in the interactions with entry receptors and fusogenic glycoproteins and with cellular proteins required to block apoptosis. The evidence that glycosylation of gD is required for blocking apoptosis supports the conclusion that the interacting protein is the mannose-6 phosphate receptor. Three-dimensional structure of herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoprotein D at 2.4-nanometer resolution. Herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoprotein D (gD) is essential for virus infectivity and is responsible for binding to cellular membrane proteins and subsequently promoting fusion between the virus envelope and the cell. No structural data are available for gD or for any other herpesvirus envelope protein. Here we present a three-dimensional model for the baculovirus-expressed truncated protein gD1(306t) based on electron microscopic data. We demonstrate that gD1(306t) appears as a homotetramer containing a pronounced pocket in the center of the molecule. Monoclonal antibody binding demonstrates that the\ninhibitors. The domains of glycoprotein D required to block apoptosis induced by herpes simplex virus 1 are largely distinct from those involved in cell-cell fusion and binding to nectin1. Glycoprotein D (gD) interacts with two alternative protein receptors, nectin1 and HveA, to mediate herpes simplex virus (HSV) entry into cells. Fusion of the envelope with the plasma membrane requires, in addition to gD, glycoproteins gB, gH, and gL. Coexpression of the four glycoproteins (gD, gB, gH, and gL) promotes cell-cell fusion. gD delivered in trans is also capable of blocking the apoptosis induced by gD deletion viruses grown either in noncomplementing cells (gD(-/-)) or in complementing cells (gD(-/+)). While ectopic expression of cation-independent mannose-6 phosphate receptor blocks apoptosis induced by both stocks, other requirements differ. Thus, apoptosis induced by gD(-/-) virus is blocked by full-length gD (or two gD fragments reconstituting a full-length molecule), whereas ectopic expression of the gD\nIn summary, our data demonstrate the existence of a gD-independent mode of initiation of infection in PrV and indicate that the essential function(s) that gD performs in wild-type PrV infection can be compensated for after passaging. Therefore, regarding the requirement for gD, PrV seems to be intermediate between herpes simplex virus type 1, in which gD is necessary for penetration and cell-to-cell spread, and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which lacks a gD gene. Our data show that the relevance of an essential protein can change under selective pressure and thus demonstrate a way in which VZV could have evolved from a PrV-like ancestor. Glycoprotein D of herpes simplex virus (HSV) binds directly to HVEM, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and a mediator of HSV entry. Glycoprotein D (gD) is a structural component of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) envelope which is essential for virus entry into host\nfor virion gD and that the interaction between these proteins is a step in HSV entry into HVEM-expressing cells. Binding of herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D to nectin-1 exploits host cell adhesion. Multiple surface envelope proteins are involved in the human herpes simplex virus type 1 entry and fusion. Among them, glycoprotein D (gD) has an important role by binding to the host receptors such as herpes virus entry mediator and nectin-1. Although the complex structure of gD with herpes virus entry mediator has been established, the binding mode of gD with the nectin-1 is elusive. Nectin-1 is a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig)-like (three Ig-like domains) cell adhesion molecules and is believed to form a homodimer to exert its functions. Here we report the complex structure of gD and nectin-1 (three Ig domains), revealing that gD binds the first Ig domain of nectin-1 in a similar mode to the\nnow we have been unable to demonstrate a direct interaction between gD and gH/gL. Here, we used a highly sensitive surface plasmon resonance technique to clearly demonstrate that gD and gH/gL interact. Furthermore, using multiple MAbs with defined epitopes, we have delineated a domain on gD that is independent of that used for receptor binding and which likely represents the gH/gL interaction domain. Targeting this interaction to prevent fusion may enhance both therapeutic and vaccine strategies. Structure-based analysis of the herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D binding site present on herpesvirus entry mediator HveA (HVEM). Binding of herpes simplex virus (HSV) envelope glycoprotein D (gD) to a cell surface receptor is an essential step of virus entry. We recently determined the crystal structure of gD bound to one receptor, HveA. HveA is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family and contains four characteristic cysteine-rich domains (CRDs). The first two\nN-terminal amino acid sequencing. The results show that cysteine 1 (amino acid [aa] 66) is bonded to cysteine 5 (aa 189), cysteine 2 (aa 106) is bonded to cysteine 6 (aa 202), and cysteine 3 (aa 118) is bonded to cysteine 4 (aa 127). Thus, the biochemical analysis of gD-2 agrees with the genetic analysis of gD-1. A similar disulfide bond arrangement is postulated to exist in other gD homologs. Separation of receptor-binding and profusogenic domains of glycoprotein D of herpes simplex virus 1 into distinct interacting proteins. The 369-residue glycoprotein D (gD) is the entry, receptor-binding protein of herpes simplex virus 1. The common receptors for viral entry are nectin-1, HveA, and a specific O-linked sulfated proteoglycan. The major receptor-binding sites of gD are at the N terminus, whereas the domain required for fusion of viral envelope with the plasma membrane is at the C terminus of the ectodomain\ninduced by gD(-/-) mutant virus stocks can be blocked by in trans delivery of viral genes that encode either intact gD or a mixture of two genes encoding the glycoprotein ectodomain plus transmembrane domain (gD-B) and transmembrane domain plus the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of the protein (gD-D), respectively. Since the presence of the transmembrane domains was critical for precluding apoptosis in the bipartite system, the question arose whether the two components, gD-B and gD-D, form a heterodimer mediated by an unpaired cysteine located in the transmembrane domain. We report the following. (i) The substitution of the unpaired cysteine with serine in either gD-B or gD-D truncated forms of gD disabled the ability of gD-D and gD-B to block apoptosis. (ii) Immunoprecipitation of gD-D coprecipitated gD-B only from lysates of cells transduced with gD-D and gD-B containing the cysteine in the transmembrane domains. Replacement of cysteine with serine ablated coprecipitation of\nStructure-based mutagenesis of herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D defines three critical regions at the gD-HveA/HVEM binding interface. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) entry into cells requires the binding of glycoprotein D (gD) to one of several cell surface receptors. The crystal structure of gD bound to one of these receptors, HveA/HVEM, reveals that the core of gD comprises an immunoglobulin fold flanked by a long C-terminal extension and an N-terminal hairpin loop. HveA is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family and contains four cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) characteristic of this family. Fourteen amino acids within the gD N-terminal loop comprise the entire binding site for HveA. To determine the contribution of each gD contact residue to virus entry, we constructed gD molecules mutated in these amino acids. We determined the abilities of the gD mutants to bind receptors, facilitate virus entry, and mediate cell-cell fusion. Seven of the gD\nnectin-1 (three Ig domains), revealing that gD binds the first Ig domain of nectin-1 in a similar mode to the nectin-1 homodimer interaction. The key amino acids responsible for nectin-1 dimerization are also used for gD/nectin-1 binding. This result indicates that binding of gD to nectin-1 would preclude the nectin-1 dimerization, consequently abolishing its cell adhesion function. Truncated forms of glycoprotein D of herpes simplex virus 1 capable of blocking apoptosis and of low-efficiency entry into cells form a heterodimer dependent on the presence of a cysteine located in the shared transmembrane domains. Earlier studies have shown that herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) virions of mutant lacking glycoprotein D (gD) and made in either complementing (gD(-/+) stocks) or noncomplementing cells (gD(-/-) stocks) induce apoptosis. Subsequent studies have shown that apoptosis induced by gD(-/-) mutant virus stocks can be blocked by in trans delivery of viral genes that encode either intact\ntransduced with gD-D and gD-B containing the cysteine in the transmembrane domains. Replacement of cysteine with serine ablated coprecipitation of the components. (ii) The mixture of gD-D and gD-B complemented at a low level gD(-/+) virions. We conclude that the gD-B and gD-D can form a heterodimer dependent on the presence of cysteines in the transmembrane domain and the heterodimer can substitute for intact gD but at a much reduced efficiency. Surface Plasmon Resonance Reveals Direct Binding of Herpes Simplex Virus Glycoproteins gH/gL to gD and Locates a gH/gL Binding Site on gD. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) requires fusion between the viral envelope and host membrane. Four glycoproteins, gD, gH/gL, and gB, are essential for this process. To initiate fusion, gD binds its receptor and undergoes a conformational change that hypothetically leads to activation of gH/gL, which in turn triggers the fusion protein gB to undergo rearrangements leading to membrane\nencode executable functions required for viral entry into cells and suggest that the receptor-binding ligand must interact with but need not alter the structure of the residual portion of gD to effect virus entry. This finding opens the way for the development of a family of recombinant viruses in which the profusion domain of gD and independently furnished, interacting receptor-binding domains effect entry of the virus via a range of receptors. Effects of herpes simplex virus on structure and function of nectin-1/HveC. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) entry requires the interaction between the envelope glycoprotein D (gD) and a cellular receptor such as nectin-1 (also named herpesvirus entry mediator C [HveC]) or HveA/HVEM. Nectin-1 is a cell adhesion molecule found at adherens junctions associated with the cytoplasmic actin-binding protein afadin. Nectin-1 can act as its own ligand in a homotypic interaction to bridge cells together. We used a cell aggregation assay\nappears as a homotetramer containing a pronounced pocket in the center of the molecule. Monoclonal antibody binding demonstrates that the molecule is oriented such that the pocket protrudes away from the virus envelope. The cytoplasmic tail of herpes simplex virus envelope glycoprotein D binds to the tegument protein VP22 and to capsids. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) capsids assemble, mature and package their viral genome in the nucleoplasm. They then exit the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where they acquire their final tegument and envelope. The molecular mechanism of cytoplasmic envelopment is unclear, but evidence suggests that the viral glycoprotein tails play an important role in the recruitment of tegument and capsids at the final envelopment site. However, due to redundancy in protein-protein interactions among the viral glycoproteins, genetic analysis of the role of individual glycoproteins in assembly has been difficult. To overcome this problem, a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein-binding assay was\nHSV entry. Our results also suggest that an intermolecular beta-sheet formed between gD and HveA residues 35 to 37 contributes to binding and that a C37-C19 disulfide bond in CRD1 is a critical component of HveA structure necessary for gD binding. The results argue that CRD2 is required for gD binding mainly to provide structural support for a gD binding site in CRD1. Only one mutant, HveA-R75A, exhibited enhanced gD binding. While some mutations influenced complex formation, the majority did not affect HSV entry, suggesting that most contact residues contribute to HveA receptor function collectively rather than individually. This structure-based dissection of the gD-HveA binding site highlights the contribution of key residues within HveA to gD binding and HSV entry and defines a target region for the design of small-molecule inhibitors. The domains of glycoprotein D required to block apoptosis induced by herpes simplex virus 1 are largely distinct from\nCRD2 contributes to HveA binding. None of the gD mutations prevented interaction with nectin-1, another gD receptor. However, when cotransfected with the other glycoproteins required for fusion, two gD mutants gained the ability to mediate fusion of cells expressing nectin-2, a gD receptor that interacts with several laboratory-derived gD mutants but not with wild-type gD. Thus, results from this panel of gD mutants as well as those of previous studies (A. Carfi, S. H. Willis, J. C. Whitbeck, C. Krummenacher, G. H. Cohen, R. J. Eisenberg, and D. C. Wiley, Mol. Cell 8:169-179, 2001, and S. A. Connolly, D. J. Landsburg, A. Carfi, D. C. Wiley, R. J. Eisenberg, and G. H. Cohen, J. Virol. 76:10894-10904, 2002) provide a detailed picture of the gD-HveA interface and the contacts required for functional interaction. The results demonstrate that of the 35 gD and HveA contact residues that comprise the gD-HveA interface, only\na 30-min period of infection, as reflected by a decrease in the CK41 epitope and an increase in the CK35 epitope. The level of detection of virion gD on the cell surface increased within 5 min of infection in a receptor-dependent manner. These observations suggest that cell surface nectin-1 and gD may undergo conformational changes during HSV entry as part of an evolving interaction between the viral envelope and the cell plasma membrane.\nthe domain required for fusion of viral envelope with the plasma membrane is at the C terminus of the ectodomain (residues 260-310). In the course of retargeting gD to the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) receptor for potential therapeutic applications, we obtained a genetically engineered infectious virus in which the receptor-binding domain consisting of the N-terminal domain of uPA fused to residues 33-60 of gD was separated from an independently expressed C-terminal domain of gD containing residues 219-369. The intervening sequences (residues 62-218) were replaced by a stop codon and a promoter for the C-terminal domain of gD. The physical interaction of the two components was reconstructed by coimmunoprecipitation of the N-terminal domain of uPA with the C-terminal domain of gD. These results indicate that codons 61-218 of gD do not encode executable functions required for viral entry into cells and suggest that the receptor-binding ligand must interact with but need\nof the herpes simplex virus envelope which is essential for virus penetration. The function of this protein is highly dependent on its structure, and its structure is dependent on maintenance of three intact disulfide bonds. gD contains six cysteines in its ectodomain whose spacing is conserved among all its homologs in other alphaherpesviruses as well as Marek's disease virus. For other proteins, conservation of cysteine spacing correlates with conservation of disulfide bond structure. We have now solved the disulfide bond structure of gD-1 and gD-2 of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, respectively. Two approaches were used. First, we constructed 15 double-Cys mutants of gD-1, representing all possible disulfide pairs. In each case, codons for cysteines were changed to serine. We reasoned that if two cysteines normally form a disulfide bond, double mutations which eliminate one proper bond should be less harmful to gD structure than double mutations which\n(gD) is a structural component of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) envelope which is essential for virus entry into host cells. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells are one of the few cell types which are nonpermissive for the entry of many HSV strains. However, when these cells are transformed with the gene for the herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), the resulting cells, CHO-HVEM12, are permissive for many HSV strains, such as HSV-1(KOS). By virtue of its four cysteine-rich pseudorepeats, HVEM is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily of proteins. Recombinant forms of gD and HVEM, gD-1(306t) and HVEM(200t), respectively, were used to demonstrate a specific physical interaction between these two proteins. This interaction was dependent on native gD conformation but independent of its N-linked oligosaccharides, as expected from previous structure-function studies. Recombinant forms of gD derived from HSV-1(KOS)rid1 and HSV-1(ANG) did not bind to HVEM(200t), explaining the inability",

Integral membrane protein complexes consisting of proteins and small molecules that act as cofactors have important functions in all organisms. To form functional complexes, cofactor biosynthesis must be coordinated with the production of corresponding apoproteins. To examine this coordination, we study bacteriorhodopsin (BR), a light-induced proton pump in the halophilic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum. This complex consists of a retinal cofactor and bacterioopsin (BO), the BR apoprotein. To examine possible novel regulatory mechanisms linking BO and retinal biosynthesis, we deleted bop, the gene that encodes BO. bop deletion resulted in a dramatic increase of bacterioruberins, carotenoid molecules that share biosynthetic precursors with retinal. Additional studies revealed that bacterioruberins accumulate in the absence of BO regardless of the presence of retinal or BR, suggesting that BO inhibits bacterioruberin biosynthesis to increase the availability of carotenoid precursors for retinal biosynthesis. To further examine this potential\nHalobacterium salinarum Bacteriorhodopsin consists of the bacterioopsin protein and a retinal cofactor. In this article, we further characterize a novel regulatory mechanism in which bacterioopsin promotes retinal production by inhibiting a reaction that consumes lycopene, a retinal precursor. By expressing H. salinarum genes in a different organism, Haloferax volcanii, we demonstrated that bacterioopsin alone is sufficient for this inhibition. We also found that an opsin from Haloarcula vallismortis has inhibitory activity, suggesting that this regulatory mechanism might be found in other organisms. Conformational changes in bacteriorhodopsin associated with protein-protein interactions: a functional alpha I-alpha II helix switch? Fourier transform infrared spectra of bacteriorhodopsin samples were obtained in conditions in which the aggregation state of the protein (i.e., monomeric or trimeric) was modified by different treatments. Two approaches were followed: (1) renaturation of bacteriorhodopsin starting from bacterioopsin dissolved in SDS and (2) reconstitution of bacterioopsin in Halobacterium lipid liposomes at two\nproduce ion-pumping rhodopsin complexes that allow them to maintain electrochemical gradients when aerobic respiration is inhibited. Rhodopsins require a protein, an opsin, and an organic cofactor, retinal. We previously demonstrated that in Halobacterium salinarum, bacterioopsin (BO), when not bound by retinal, inhibits the production of bacterioruberin, a biochemical pathway that shares intermediates with retinal biosynthesis. In this work, we used heterologous expression in a related halophilic archaeon, Haloferax volcanii, to demonstrate that BO is sufficient to inhibit bacterioruberin synthesis catalyzed by the H. salinarum lycopene elongase (Lye) enzyme. This inhibition was observed both in liquid culture and in a novel colorimetric assay to quantify bacterioruberin abundance based on the colony color. Addition of retinal to convert BO to the bacteriorhodopsin complex resulted in a partial rescue of bacterioruberin production. To explore if this regulatory mechanism occurs in other organisms, we expressed a Lye homolog and an opsin from Haloarcula vallismortis\na strategy for creating three-dimensional crystals of integral membrane proteins which involves the addition of a large soluble domain to the membrane protein to provide crystallization contacts. As a test of this strategy we designed a fusion between the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin (BR) and the catalytic subunit of aspartyl transcarbamylase from Escherichia coli. The fusion protein (designated BRAT) was initially expressed in E. coli at 51 mg/liter of culture, to yield active aspartyl transcarbamylase and an unfolded bacterio-opsin (BO) component. In Halobacterium salinarum, BRAT was expressed at a yield of 7 mg/liter of culture and formed a high-density purple membrane. The visible absorption properties of BRAT were indistinguishable from those of BR, demonstrating that the fusion with aspartyl transcarbamylase had no effect on BR structure. Electron microscopy of BRAT membrane sheets showed that the fusion protein was trimeric and organized in a two-dimensional crystalline lattice similar to that in the\nexplore if this regulatory mechanism occurs in other organisms, we expressed a Lye homolog and an opsin from Haloarcula vallismortis in H. volcaniiH. vallismortis cruxopsin-3 expression inhibited bacterioruberin synthesis catalyzed by H. vallismortis Lye but had no effect when bacterioruberin synthesis was catalyzed by H. salinarum or H. volcanii Lye. Conversely, H. salinarum BO did not inhibit H. vallismortis Lye activity. Together, our data suggest that opsin-mediated inhibition of Lye is potentially widespread and represents an elegant regulatory mechanism that allows organisms to efficiently utilize ion-pumping rhodopsins obtained through lateral gene transfer.IMPORTANCE Many enzymes are complexes of proteins and nonprotein organic molecules called cofactors. To ensure efficient formation of functional complexes, organisms must regulate the production of proteins and cofactors. To study this regulation, we used bacteriorhodopsin from the archaeon Halobacterium salinarum Bacteriorhodopsin consists of the bacterioopsin protein and a retinal cofactor. In this article, we further characterize a novel\nrenaturation of bacteriorhodopsin starting from bacterioopsin dissolved in SDS and (2) reconstitution of bacterioopsin in Halobacterium lipid liposomes at two different lipid/protein ratios. Concomitant with the gradual recovery of the native interactions between transmembrane helices, we observed clear and gradual changes in the infrared absorption spectra in the amide I band and also in the band at 1741 cm-1. These processes were found to be compatible with the two-state oligomerization model. The whole set of experiments shows that the band at 1665 cm-1 in the deconvoluted spectra appears only when monomers interact forming trimers, even when the lattice is not present. This implies that the trimeric organization of bacteriorhodopsin is responsible for the unique features described in the amide I of purple membrane. The spectroscopic changes detected can be attributed to changes in secondary structure compatible with the interconversion of alpha I and alpha II helices. However, the exact nature\nthat BO inhibits bacterioruberin biosynthesis to increase the availability of carotenoid precursors for retinal biosynthesis. To further examine this potential regulatory mechanism, we characterized an enzyme, encoded by the lye gene, that catalyzes bacterioruberin biosynthesis. BO-mediated inhibition of bacterioruberin synthesis appears to be specific to the H. salinarum lye-encoded enzyme, as expression of a lye homolog from Haloferax volcanii, a related archaeon that synthesizes bacterioruberins but lacks opsins, resulted in bacterioruberin synthesis that was not reduced in the presence of BO. Our results provide evidence for a novel regulatory mechanism in which biosynthesis of a cofactor is promoted by apoprotein-mediated inhibition of an alternate biochemical pathway. Specifically, BO accumulation promotes retinal production by inhibiting bacterioruberin biosynthesis.

We are testing a strategy for creating three-dimensional crystals of integral membrane proteins which involves the addition of a large soluble domain to\nsheets showed that the fusion protein was trimeric and organized in a two-dimensional crystalline lattice similar to that in the BR purple membrane. Following solubilization and size-exclusion purification in sodium dodecyl sulfate, the BO portion of the fusion was quantitatively refolded in tetradecyl maltoside (TDM). Ultracentrifugation demonstrated that BR and BRAT-TDM mixed micelles had molecular masses of 138 and 162 kDa, respectively, with a stoichiometry of one protein per micelle. High TDM concentrations (>20 mM) were required to maintain BRAT solubility, hindering three-dimensional crystallization trials. We have demonstrated that BR can functionally accommodate massive C-terminal fusions and that these fusions may be expressed in quantities required for structural investigation in H. salinarum.

        "desc": "or indirectly upon priming by activated macrophages and DCs (Newman & Riley,). The latter potently activates NK cells in vivo in a process that requires the formation of an immunological synapse (IS) between activated macrophages or DCs, and NK cells. At the IS, myeloid cells and NK cells exchange soluble and contact\u2010dependent activating signals (Newman & Riley,). Once activated, NK cells deploy cytolytic activity to eliminate infected and malignantly transformed cells and contribute to the regulation of adaptive cells by producing cytokines including IFN\u2010\u03b3, IL\u201010 and TNF (Vivier et al,). Ebihara et al identified calcium homeostasis modulator 6 (CALHM6), also known as IFN regulatory factor 3\u2010dependent NK\u2010activating molecule (INAM), as a membrane protein induced in activated macrophages and DCs. CALHM6 was required to induce IFN\u2010\u03b3 secretion, but not cytotoxicity, from NK cells. Consequently, CALHM6 deficiency resulted in poor anti\u2010tumour immunity against IFN\u2010sensitive metastatic tumours and reduced efficacy of IFN\u2010dependent, poly(I:C)\u2010based\nin IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells interacting with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid-stimulated accessory cells. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid strongly promotes the antitumor activity of NK cells via TLR3/Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adaptor molecule 1 and melanoma differentiation-associated protein-5/mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein pathways. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid acts on accessory cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (M\u03c6s) to secondarily activate NK cells. In a previous study in this context, we identified a novel NK-activating molecule, named IFN regulatory factor 3-dependent NK-activating molecule (INAM), a tetraspanin-like membrane glycoprotein (also called Fam26F). In the current study, we generated INAM-deficient mice and investigated the in vivo function of INAM. We found that cytotoxicity against NK cell-sensitive tumor cell lines was barely decreased in Inam(-/-) mice, whereas the number of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells was markedly decreased in the early phase. Notably, deficiency of INAM in NK and accessory cells, such as CD8\u03b1(+) conventional DCs and M\u03c6s, led to a robust decrease in\nthe endosomal membrane and interacts with the adaptor toll/interleukin 1 receptor homology domain-containing adaptor molecule 1 (TICAM-1; TRIF). TICAM-1 signals culminate in interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF) 3 activation. Co-culture of mDC pretreated with the TLR3 ligand polyI:C and natural killer (NK) cells resulted in NK cell activation. This activation was triggered by cell-to-cell contact but not cytokines. Using expression profiling and gain/loss-of-function analyses of mDC genes, we tried to identify a TICAM-1-inducing membrane protein that participates in mDC-mediated NK activation. Of the nine candidates screened, one contained a tetraspanin-like sequence and satisfied the screening criteria. The protein, referred to as IRF-3-dependent NK-activating molecule (INAM), functioned in both the mDC and NK cell to facilitate NK activation. In the mDC, TICAM-1, IFN promoter stimulator 1, and IRF-3, but not IRF-7, were required for mDC-mediated NK activation. INAM was minimally expressed on NK cells, was up-regulated in response to polyI:C, and\nof INAM in NK and accessory cells, such as CD8\u03b1(+) conventional DCs and M\u03c6s, led to a robust decrease in IFN-\u03b3 production. In conformity with this phenotype, INAM effectively suppressed lung metastasis of B16F10 melanoma cells, which is controlled by NK1.1(+) cells and IFN-\u03b3. These results suggest that INAM plays a critical role in NK-CD8\u03b1(+) conventional DC (and M\u03c6) interaction leading to IFN-\u03b3 production from NK cells in vivo. INAM could therefore be a novel target molecule for cancer immunotherapy against IFN-\u03b3-suppressible metastasis. FAM26F: An Enigmatic Protein Having a Complex Role in the Immune System. Mammalian immune system is a complex amalgam of diverse cellular and noncellular components such as cytokines, receptors and co-receptors. FAM26F (family with sequence similarity 26, member F) is a recently identified tetraspanin-like membrane glycoprotein which is predicted to make homophilic interactions and potential synapses between several immune cells including CD4+, CD8+, NK, dendritic cells and\n7 (IRF7)-mediated interferon signal transduction by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus viral IRF homolog vIRF3 The ORF45 protein of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is associated with purified virions Evasion and subversion of interferon-mediated antiviral immunity by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus: an overview IRF-4-mediated CIITA transcription is blocked by KSHV encoded LANA to inhibit MHC II presentation Herpes simplex virus 1-encoded tegument protein VP16 abrogates the production of beta interferon (IFN) by inhibiting NF-\u03baB activation and blocking IFN regulatory factor 3 to recruit its coactivator CBP Varicella-zoster virus immediate-early protein ORF61 abrogates the IRF3-mediated innate immune response through degradation of activated IRF3 Regulation of interferon regulatory factor-3 by the hepatitis C virus serine protease Hepatitis C virus NS2 and NS3/4A proteins are potent inhibitors of host cell cytokine/chemokine gene expression Hepatitis C virus NS5A protein modulates IRF-7-mediated interferon-\u03b1 signaling siRNA targeting the IRF2 transcription factor inhibits leukaemic cell growth MicroRNA 125b inhibition of B\nwere required for mDC-mediated NK activation. INAM was minimally expressed on NK cells, was up-regulated in response to polyI:C, and contributed to mDC-NK reciprocal activation via its cytoplasmic tail, which was crucial for the activation signal in NK cells. Adoptive transfer of INAM-expressing mDCs into mice implanted with NK-sensitive tumors caused NK-mediated tumor regression. We identify a new pathway for mDC-NK contact-mediated NK activation that is governed by a TLR signal-derived membrane molecule. Is 14-3-3 the Combination to Unlock New Pathways to Improve Metabolic Homeostasis and \u03b2-Cell Function? Since their discovery nearly five decades ago, molecular scaffolds belonging to the 14-3-3 protein family have been recognized as pleiotropic regulators of diverse cellular and physiological functions. With their ability to bind to proteins harboring specific serine and threonine phosphorylation motifs, 14-3-3 proteins can interact with and influence the function of docking proteins, enzymes, transcription factors, and transporters that have essential roles\nthe phosphorylation state, conformation, and function of PU.1 via activation of casein kinase II JAK2 V617F-dependent upregulation of PU.1 expression in the peripheral blood of myeloproliferative neoplasm patients Differential phosphorylations of Spi-B and Spi-1 transcription factors Interferon induces up-regulation of Spi-1/PU.1 in human leukemia K562 cells PU.1 recruits a second nuclear factor to a site important for immunoglobulin kappa 3' enhancer activity PU.1, interferon regulatory factor 1, and interferon consensus sequence-binding protein cooperate to increase gp91(phox) expression Pip, a novel IRF family member, is a lymphoid-specific, PU.1-dependent transcriptional activator Assembly requirements of PU.1-Pip (IRF-4) activator complexes: inhibiting function in vivo using fused dimers Roles of IFN consensus sequence binding protein and PU.1 in regulating IL-18 gene expression A dual cis-regulatory code links IRF8 to constitutive and inducible gene expression in macrophages PU.1/Interferon regulatory factor interactions: mechanisms of transcriptional regulation The many faces of CREB Deficient long-term memory in mice with\nNK sensitive tumors. Current review provides a comprehensive basis to propose that FAM26F expression level is at least a hallmark for IFN-\u03b3-lead immune responses and thus can proficiently be regarded as an early diagnostic marker. Future investigation dissecting the role of FAM26F in activation of various immune cell populations in local amplification by cell-cell contact is crucial to provide the missing link imperative for elucidating the relevance of this protein in immune responses. Rubicon Modulates Antiviral Type I Interferon (IFN) Signaling by Targeting IFN Regulatory Factor 3 Dimerization. Rubicon is part of a Beclin-1-Vps34-containing autophagy complex. Rubicon induces antimicrobial responses upon Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation and functions as a feedback inhibitor to prevent unbalanced proinflammatory responses depending on dectin-1 signaling. However, the role played by Rubicon during antiviral immune responses, particularly the type I interferon (IFN) responses, remains largely unknown. Here, we report that Rubicon acts as a negative regulator\nand gating mechanism of human calcium homeostasis modulator 2 Bacterial manipulation of NK cell regulatory activity increases susceptibility to Listeria monocytogenes infection A Batf3/Nlrp3/IL\u201018 axis promotes natural killer cell IL\u201010 production during Listeria monocytogenes infection Cryo\u2010EM structures of calcium homeostasis modulator channels in diverse oligomeric assemblies Brefeldin a redistributes resident and itinerant Golgi proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum Innate and adaptive immune responses during Listeria monocytogenes infection Cryo\u2010EM structures and functional properties of CALHM channels of the human placenta Neural and immunological synaptic relations Cytotoxic immunological synapses Identification of a polyI:C\u2010inducible membrane protein that participates in dendritic cell\u2010mediated natural killer cell activation TBK1 and IKKepsilon act like an OFF switch to limit NLRP3 inflammasome pathway activation EUCOMM\u2013the European conditional mouse mutagenesis program Obscurin\u2010like 1, OBSL1, is a novel cytoskeletal protein related to obscurin ATP release and purinergic signaling in NLRP3 inflammasome activation Specific immunity to Listeria monocytogenes in the absence\ndecreases InsP(3)R-dependent calcium release and alters normal signaling patterns. In the present study, we further characterized the role of N-CGB and identified roles for C-CGB. The effect of N-CGB on calcium release depended upon endogenous levels of cellular CGB, whereas the regulatory effect of C-CGB was apparent regardless of endogenous levels of CGB. When either full-length CGB or C-CGB was expressed in cells, calcium transients were increased. Additionally, the calcium signal initiation site was altered upon C-CGB expression in neuronally differentiated PC12 and SHSY5Y cells. These results show that CGB has numerous regulatory roles and that CGB is a critical component in modulating InsP(3)R-dependent calcium signaling.

Knockdown of TMEM33 increased host ifn transcription. Subsequently, we found that TMEM33 was colocalized in the ER and interacted with the RLR cascades, whereas MAVS was degraded by TMEM33 during the K48-linked ubiquitination. On the other hand, TMEM33 reduced the phosphorylation of mediator of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation (MITA)/IRF3 by acting as a decoy substrate of TBK1, which was also phosphorylated. A functional domain assay revealed that the N-terminal transmembrane domain 1 (TM1) and TM2 regions of TMEM33 were necessary for IFN suppression. Finally, TMEM33 significantly attenuated the host cellular antiviral capacity by blocking the IFN response. Taken together, our findings provide insight into the different mechanisms employed by TMEM33 in cellular IFN-mediated antiviral process. The ion channel CALHM6 controls bacterial infection\u2010induced cellular cross\u2010talk at the immunological synapse Abstract Membrane ion channels of the calcium homeostasis modulator (CALHM) family promote cell\u2013cell crosstalk at neuronal synapses via\nadhesion molecules, chemokines, and inflammatory cytokines among others. From all TLRs, the most well-known is TLR4, that recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of many bacteria. Besides LPS, other TLR4 ligands include several viral proteins and a variety of endogenous proteins such as low-density lipoprotein, beta-defensins, and heat shock proteins. TLR4 is activated upon ligand binding. As such TLR4 downstream signaling pathways either work in a manner dependent on the universal adapter protein called Myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), or in a MyD88-independent way (Figure 2, right side). In the MyD88-dependent arm of TLR4 signaling, MyD88 recruits IL-1R-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4), and IRAK1 which leads to their phosphorylation and in turn results in the association of IRAK with the ubiquitin ligase Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). TRAF6 then activates transforming growth factor-\u03b2 activating kinase (TAK1), which subsequently leads to phosphorylation of I\u03baB protein complex, composed of the\nstable protein that has been well-conserved throughout evolution. It is a signal peptide deprived transmembrane protein that is secreted through non-classical pathway. The presence of a single well-conserved Ca_hom_mod domain indicated FAM26F to be a cation channel involved in the transport of molecules. A potential N-glycosylation and 14 phosphorylation sites were also predicted, along with four interacting partners of FAM26F. The secondary and tertiary structures of FAM26F were determined. Moreover, the presence of an immunoglobulin-like fold in FAM26F emphasized its role in immune responses.CONCLUSION: This is the first in silico structural and functional characterization of FAM26F which will be helpful in better understanding the role of FAM26F in the context of the immune system and may also lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets. INAM plays a critical role in IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells interacting with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid-stimulated accessory cells.

The versatility of intracellular calcium as a second messenger is seen in its ability to mediate opposing events such as neuronal cell growth and apoptosis. A leading hypothesis used to explain how calcium regulates such divergent signaling pathways is that molecules responsible for maintaining calcium homeostasis have multiple roles. For example, chromogranin B (CGB), a calcium binding protein found in secretory granules and in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, buffers calcium and also binds to and amplifies the activity of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R). Previous studies have identified two conserved domains of CGB, an N-terminal domain (N-CGB) and a C-terminal domain (C-CGB). N-CGB binds to the third intraluminal loop of the InsP(3)R and inhibits binding of full-length CGB. This displacement of CGB decreases InsP(3)R-dependent calcium release and alters normal signaling patterns. In the present study, we further characterized the role of N-CGB\nvarious stimulants such as polyI:C, LPS, INF gamma and TNF alpha, and via various anticipated pathways including TLR3, TLR4 IFN-\u03b2 and Dectin-1. Moreover, the synergistic expression of FAM26F on both NK-cells and myeloid dendritic cells is required to activate NK-cells against tumors via its cytoplasmic tail, thus emphasizing the therapeutic potential of FAM26F for NK sensitive tumors. Although a considerable amount of evidence is present regarding the potential role of FAM26F in immune modulation, the exact function and modulatory pathways of this gene are yet to be elucidated. We aimed to completely characterize FAM26F in order to apprehend its function and role in the immune responses.RESULTS: The results revealed human FAM26F to be located at chromosomal position 6q22.1. FAM26F mRNA contains 1141bp coding region encoding a 315 amino acid long, stable protein that has been well-conserved throughout evolution. It is a signal peptide deprived transmembrane protein that is secreted through",

        "desc": "genes that encode detoxifying enzymes and antioxidant proteins. The induction of these genes confers resistance against xenobiotic and oxidative stresses. Recently, the constitutive stabilization of Nrf2 was found in various human cancers, and cancers with high Nrf2 levels are associated with poor prognosis. Consistently, the role of Nrf2 in determining the efficacy of cisplatin was also demonstrated in ovarian cancer. Moreover, many Keap1 mutations or loss of heterozygosity in the Keap1 locus has been identified in lung cancer. Therefore, identification of new factors involved in Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathways may benefit NSCLC patients with drug resistance in future. We recently used a new method, Cross-Value Association Analysis (CVAA), to analyze the pan-cancer dataset, and identified numerous new differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including Progestin and AdipoQ Receptor 4 (PAQR4), a member of the progestin and adipoQ receptor (PAQR) family, which includes 11 members (PAQR1 to PAQR11) in the human genome. The conservation\nare abrogated by PAQR3 knockdown, indicating that the effect of DDB2 on the cancer cells is mediated by PAQR3. Collectively, our studies not only pinpoint that DDB2 is a post-translational regulator of PAQR3, but also indicate that DDB2 may play an active role in tumorigenesis via regulating PAQR3. PAQR4 promotes chemoresistance in non-small cell lung cancer through inhibiting Nrf2 protein degradation Purpose: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide. We have previously identified many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from large scale pan-cancer dataset using the Cross-Value Association Analysis (CVAA) method. Here we focus on Progestin and AdipoQ Receptor 4 (PAQR4), a member of the progestin and adipoQ receptor (PAQR) family localized in the Golgi apparatus, to determine their clinical role and mechanism in the development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: The protein expression profile of PAQR4 was examined by IHC using tissue microarrays, and\nto the G(i) protein. Similar to G protein-coupled receptors, dissociation of the receptor/G protein complex results in a decrease in ligand binding to the mPRalphas and mutation of the C-terminal, and third intracellular loop of st-mPRalpha causes loss of ligand-dependent G protein activation. Phylogenetic analysis indicates the mPRs are members of a progesterone and adipoQ receptor (PAQR) subfamily that is only present in chordates, whereas other PAQRs also occur in invertebrates and plants. Progesterone and adipoQ receptors are related to the hemolysin3 family and have origins in the Eubacteria. Thus, mPRs arose from Eubacteria independently from members of the GPCR superfamily, which arose from Archeabacteria, suggesting convergent evolution of seven-transmembrane hormone receptors coupled to G proteins.

The present studies\ntogether with DDB1 and CUL4A (cullin 4A). PAQR3 (progestin and adipoQ receptor family member III) is a newly discovered tumour suppressor that is implicated in the development of many types of human cancers. In the present paper, we report that DDB2 is involved in ubiquitination and degradation of PAQR3. DDB2 is able to interact with PAQR3 in vivo and in vitro. Both overexpression and knockdown experiments reveal that the protein expression level, protein stability and polyubiquitination of PAQR3 are changed by DDB2. Negative regulation of EGF (epidermal growth factor)- and insulin-induced signalling by PAQR3 is also altered by DDB2. At the molecular level, Lys(61) of PAQR3 is targeted by DDB2 for ubiquitination. The cell proliferation rate and migration of gastric cancer cells are inhibited by DDB2 knockdown and such effects are abrogated by PAQR3 knockdown, indicating that the effect of DDB2 on the cancer cells is mediated by PAQR3. Collectively,\nthe development of predictive biomarkers and specific targeted small molecule inhibitors have led to improvements in some NSCLC patients' survival rates and quality of life. Unfortunately, there is still no effective biomarker for the majority of NSCLC patients, thus chemotherapy is their first choice treatment option. However, the problem of recurrent drug or chemotherapy resistance remains as a major challenge. In this study (Figure 5G), we identified that PAQR4, a member of the progestin and adipoQ receptor (PAQR) family, and also the closest homologue of PAQR3, is highly expressed in NSCLC cancerous tissues and cell lines. It's knockdown leads to inhibition of cell proliferation, mainly through inducing cellular apoptosis, both in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, we have shown that PAQR4 competes with Keap1 to interact with and to inhibit Nrf2 protein degradation. This activity is different from the adaptive role of PAQR3 facilitating Keap1-Nrf2 complex formation and protein degradation,\nThe steady-state level of CDK4 protein is regulated by antagonistic actions between PAQR4 and SKP2 and involved in tumorigenesis. CDK4 is crucial for G1-to-S transition of cell cycle. It is well established that ubiquitin-mediated degradations of CDK inhibitors and cyclins are pivotal for the timely and unidirectional progression of cell cycle. However, how CDK4 itself is modulated by ubiquitin-mediated degradation has been elusive. Here we report that the steady-state level of CDK4 is controlled by PAQR4, a member of the progestin and adipoQ receptor family, and SKP2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Knockdown of PAQR4 leads to reduction of cell proliferation, accompanied by reduced protein level of CDK4. PAQR4 reduces polyubiquitination and degradation of CDK4. PAQR4 interacts with the C-terminal lobe of CDK4. On the other hand, SKP2 also interacts with the C-terminal lobe of CDK4 and enhances polyubiquitination and degradation of CDK4. Importantly, PAQR4 and SKP2 bind to the same\nthe C-terminal lobe of CDK4 and enhances polyubiquitination and degradation of CDK4. Importantly, PAQR4 and SKP2 bind to the same region in CDK4, and PAQR4 competes with SKP2 for the binding, thereby abrogating SKP2-mediated ubiquitination of CDK4. Using a two-stage DMBA/TPA-induced skin cancer model, we find that PAQR4-deleted mice are resistant to chemical carcinogen-induced tumor formation. Collectively, our findings reveal that the steady-state level of CDK4 is controlled by the antagonistic actions between PAQR4 and SKP2, contributing to modulation of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. DDB2 is involved in ubiquitination and degradation of PAQR3 and regulates tumorigenesis of gastric cancer cells. DDB2 (damage-specific DNA-binding protein 2) is the product of the xeroderma pigmentosum group E gene which is involved in the initiation of nucleotide excision repair via an ubiquitin ligase complex together with DDB1 and CUL4A (cullin 4A). PAQR3 (progestin and adipoQ receptor family member III) is a newly discovered tumour\nthe progestin and adipoQ receptor (PAQR) family, which includes 11 members (PAQR1 to PAQR11) in the human genome. The conservation of the PAQR proteins between human and mouse orthologues is high. The prototypes in this family are PAQR5-8 that function as membrane receptors for progesterone, as well as AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 (i.e., PAQR1 and PAQR2) are surface receptors for adiponectin and play important roles in metabolic regulation. Especially, PAQR3, the closest homologue of PAQR4, has been recently discovered as a novel tumor suppressor deregulated in various types of human cancers including colon cancer, gastric cancer, bladder cancer, liver cancer, osteosarcoma, breast cancer, and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. PAQR3 functions as a tumor suppressor mainly due to its negative regulation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade. Moreover, PAQR3 was identified as an adaptor protein that facilitates Keap1-Nrf2 complex formation leading to Nrf2 degradation and modulates antioxidant response. Recent studies demonstrated that CDK4\nTheir Role in Regulating Progesterone's Ability to Suppress Human Granulosa/Luteal Cells from Entering into the Cell Cycle. The present studies were designed to determine the role of progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1), PGRMC2, progestin and adipoQ receptor 7 (PAQR7), and progesterone receptor (PGR) in mediating the antimitotic action of progesterone (P4) in human granulosa/luteal cells. For these studies granulosa/luteal cells of 10 women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation were isolated, maintained in culture, and depleted of PGRMC1, PGRMC2, PAQR7, or PGR by siRNA treatment. The rate of entry into the cell cycle was assessed using the FUCCI cell cycle sensor to determine the percentage of cells in the G1/S stage of the cell cycle. PGRMC1, PGRMC2, PAQR7, and PGR mRNA levels were assessed by real-time PCR and their interactions monitored by in situ proximity ligation assays (PLAs).

We show that cDNAs for the mPR\nrecently discovered in spotted seatrout and homologous genes were identified in other vertebrates. We show that cDNAs for the mPR alpha subtypes from spotted seatrout (st-mPRalpha) and humans (hu-mPRalpha) encode progestin receptors that display many functional characteristics of G protein-coupled receptors. Flow cytometry and immunocytochemical staining of whole MDA-MB-231 cells stably transfected with the mPRalphas using antibodies directed against their N-terminal regions show the receptors are localized on the plasma membrane and suggest the N-terminal domain is extracellular. Both recombinant st-mPRalpha and hu-mPRalpha display high affinity (Kd 4.2-7.8 nm), limited capacity (Bmax 0.03-0.32 nm), and displaceable membrane binding specific for progestins. Progestins activate a pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibitory G protein (G(i)) to down-regulate membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase activity in both st-mPRalpha- and hu-mPRalpha-transfected cells. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate the receptors are directly coupled to the G(i) protein. Similar to G protein-coupled receptors, dissociation of the receptor/G protein complex results in a decrease in\nIt is a member of the PAQR family involved in the regulation of a number of biological processes including metabolism and cancer development. To investigate the potential roles of PAQR4 in tumorigenesis, we examined its expression in various cancer types using gene expression profiling interactive analysis, and found that PAQR4 is highly expressed in many cancer types (Figure S1A; Table 1). In addition, we surveyed PAQR4 protein expression in NSCLC (including lung SCC and ADC) and noncancerous control lung tissues (NCLT) by immunohistochemical staining (IHC) using a tissue microarray (Figure S1B-C; Table 2). The percentage of positive PAQR4 expression was significantly higher in ADC tissues (65.9%) than that in NCLT tissues (40.8%). Furthermore, we found that PAQR4 is upregulated in both lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma by UALCAN software (Figure 1A-B) . Next, we found that PAQR4 high expression correlates with a worse overall survival rate, using a\nadaptor protein that facilitates Keap1-Nrf2 complex formation leading to Nrf2 degradation and modulates antioxidant response. Recent studies demonstrated that CDK4 protein level is controlled by the antagonistic actions between PAQR4 and SKP2, which contribute to the regulation of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. However, whether PAQR4 is involved in antioxidant or drug resistance functions in cancers remains elusive. In this study, we explored the potential antioxidant function of PAQR4 in NSCLC. Results PAQR4 is highly expressed in NSCLC In our previous study, we developed a new method called CVAA (Cross-Value Association Analysis), which functions without a normalization and distribution assumption. We applied it to large-scale pan-cancer transcriptome data generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, and successfully discovered numerous new differentially expressed genes (DEGs). PAQR4 is one of these DEGs. It is a member of the PAQR family involved in the regulation of a number of biological processes including metabolism\nwith 10\u03bcM BrdU (Abcam, Cat# ab142567) for 20 min, and fixed with 4% PFA (paraformaldehyde). Cells were then incubated with BrdU (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat# 5292s, dilution 1:1000) primary antibody followed by secondary antibody detection (Abclonal, Cat# 61303, dilution 1:500). Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). For colony formation assay, indicated cells were seeded in agar medium in 6-well plate with 3\u00d7103 cells per well supplemented with 2 mL 10% FBS cell culture medium, and the medium changed every 3 days for 2~3 weeks. Indicated cells were fixed with 4% PFA and stained with crystal violet. Xenograft tumor formation assay in vivo Male nude mice aged 5 weeks were randomly divided into different groups, and were then injected with 2 independent PAQR4 knockdown cell lines or scramble control shRNA cells, (1\u00d7106 cells/ subcutaneously). Nude mice were monitored every day, xenograft tumor weights and volumes were measured with a\nNrf2 protein degradation. This activity is different from the adaptive role of PAQR3 facilitating Keap1-Nrf2 complex formation and protein degradation, and decreased expression of PAQR3 in NSCLC can also lead to chemoresistance by increasing Nrf2 stability. Consistent with this finding, we identified that PAQR3 is decreased in NSCLC. Furthermore, PAQR4 knockdown promotes the sensitivity of cancerous cell to DDP/ Paclitaxel treatment through decreasing Nrf2 protein levels. The underlying mechanism of why PAQR4 behaves differently from PAQR3 in NSCLC is still unknown, and deciphering the expression regulation of these two family members under different cellular or tissue context might be able to resolve this mystery. For example, the promoter methylation levels or transcriptional regulation mechanisms may be different. Due to lack of commercial or homemade antibodies detecting PAQR4, we were unable to determine the protein expression patterns of PAQR4 both in cancerous tissues or cell lines. Therefore, whether endogenous PAQR4 interacts\nIndeed, we identified many PAQR4 mutants in NSCLC by applying the cBioPortal web resource (Figure 1D; Table 3-4), suggesting that PAQR4 plays potential important role in lung homeostasis. PAQR4 knockdown inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation and induces cellular apoptosis NSCLC cell lines SPC-A1 and GLC-82 were chosen to further validate the functional roles of PAQR4. We inhibited PAQR4 mRNA expression with two lenti-viral shRNAs (Materials and Methods), and verified the inhibition efficiency by real-time RT-PCR (Figure 1F-G). As expected, stable knockdown of PAQR4 inhibited SPC-A1 and GLC-82 cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro, and this effect could be rescued by PAQR4 overexpression (Figure 1H-J and Figure S1D, E, I, J). Indeed, we observed that PAQR4 knockdown significantly decreased the ratio of BrdU-positive cells in SPC-A1 and GLC-82 (Figure 1K-L and Figure S1F-G).

Methamphetamine (MA) impairs vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) and dopamine transporter (DAT) function and expression, increasing intracellular DA levels that lead to neurotoxicity. The trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) is activated by MA, but when the receptor is not activated, MA-induced neurotoxicity is increased. To investigate interactions among TAAR1, VMAT2, and DAT, transporter function and expression were measured in transgenic Taar1 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice 24 hours following a binge-like regimen (four intraperitoneal injections, 2 hours apart) of MA (5 mg/kg) or the same schedule of saline treatment. Striatal synaptosomes were separated by fractionation to examine the function and expression of VMAT2 localized to cytosolic and membrane-associated vesicles. DAT was measured in whole synaptosomes.

The Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1 Agonist 3-Iodothyronamine Induces Biased Signaling at the Serotonin 1b Receptor. Trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) belong to the class A G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and are evolutionary related to aminergic receptors. TAARs have been identified to mediate effects of trace amines. TAAR1 signaling is mainly mediated via activation of the Gs/adenylyl cyclase pathway. In addition to classical trace amines, TAAR1 can also be activated by the thyroid hormone derivative 3-iodothyronamine (3-T1AM). Pharmacological doses of 3-T1AM induced metabolic and anapyrexic effects, which might be centrally mediated in the hypothalamus in rodents. However, the observed anapyrexic effect of 3-T1AM persists in Taar1 knock-out mice which raises the question whether further GPCRs are potential targets for 3-T1AM and mediate the observed physiological effect. Anapyrexia has been observed to be related to action on aminergic receptors such as the serotonin receptor 1b (5-HT1b).\nsurface, i.e., on membrane-associated vesicles. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Methamphetamine stimulates the G protein-coupled receptor TAAR1 to affect dopaminergic function and neurotoxicity. Here we demonstrate that a functional TAAR1 protects a specific subcellular fraction of VMAT2, but not the dopamine transporter, from methamphetamine-induced effects, suggesting new directions in pharmacotherapeutic development for neurodegenerative disorders. Ligand recognition and G-protein coupling of trace amine receptor TAAR1. Trace-amine-associated receptors (TAARs), a group of biogenic amine receptors, have essential roles in neurological and metabolic homeostasis1. They recognize diverse endogenous trace amines and subsequently activate a range of G-protein-subtype signalling pathways2,3. Notably, TAAR1 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for treating psychiatric disorders4,5. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its ability to recognize different ligands remain largely unclear. Here we present nine cryo-electron microscopy structures, with eight showing human and mouse TAAR1 in a complex with an array of ligands, including the endogenous 3-iodothyronamine, two antipsychotic agents, the\nReceptor 1: Pharmacology, Neurochemistry, and Clinical Implications. Biogenic amines are a collection of endogenous molecules that play pivotal roles as neurotransmitters and hormones. In addition to the \"classical\" biogenic amines resulting from decarboxylation of aromatic acids, including dopamine (DA), norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin (5-HT), and histamine, other biogenic amines, present at much lower concentrations in the central nervous system (CNS), and hence referred to as \"trace\" amines (TAs), are now recognized to play significant neurophysiological and behavioral functions. At the turn of the century, the discovery of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a phylogenetically conserved G protein-coupled receptor that is responsive to both TAs, such as \u03b2-phenylethylamine, octopamine, and tyramine, and structurally-related amphetamines, unveiled mechanisms of action for TAs other than interference with aminergic pathways, laying the foundations for deciphering the functional significance of TAs and its mammalian CNS receptor, TAAR1.

These structures reveal a rigid consensus binding motif in TAAR1 that binds to endogenous trace amine stimuli and two extended binding pockets that accommodate diverse chemotypes. Combined with mutational analysis, functional assays and molecular dynamic simulations, we elucidate the structural basis of drug polypharmacology and identify the species-specific differences between human and mouse TAAR1. Our study provides insights into the mechanism of ligand recognition and G-protein selectivity by TAAR1, which may help in the discovery of ligands or therapeutic strategies for neurological and metabolic disorders.

Biogenic amines are a collection of endogenous molecules that play pivotal roles as\nand other monoamine receptors. We identify a lid-like extracellular loop 2 helix/loop structure and a hydrogen-bonding network in the ligand-binding pockets, which may contribute to the ligand recognition in TAAR1. These findings shed light on the ligand recognition mode and activation mechanism for TAAR1 and should guide the development of next-generation therapeutics for drug addiction and various neurological disorders. Structure-Based Discovery of Mouse Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 5 Antagonists. Trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) were discovered in 2001 as new members of class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). With the only exception of TAAR1, TAAR members (TAAR2-9, also known as noncanonical olfactory receptors) were originally described exclusively in the olfactory epithelium and believed to mediate the innate perception of volatile amines. However, most noncanonical olfactory receptors are still orphan receptors. Given its recently discovered nonolfactory expression and therapeutic potential, TAAR5 has been the focus of deorphanization campaigns that led to the discovery\nTAAR1, their intricate neurochemistry and pharmacology, and their relevance for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease. Functional interaction between trace amine-associated receptor 1 and dopamine D2 receptor. The ability of dopamine receptors to interact with other receptor subtypes may provide mechanisms for modulating dopamine-related functions and behaviors. In particular, there is evidence suggesting that the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) affects the dopaminergic system by regulating the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons or by altering dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) responsiveness to ligands. TAAR1 is a G\u03b1(s) protein-coupled receptor that is activated by biogenic amines, \"trace amines,\" such as \u03b2-phenylethylamine (\u03b2-PEA) and tyramine that are normally found at low concentrations in the mammalian brain. In the present study, we investigated the biochemical mechanism of interaction between TAAR1 and D2R and the role this interaction plays in D2R-related signaling and behaviors. Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer biosensor for cAMP, we demonstrated that the\nthe functional significance of TAs and its mammalian CNS receptor, TAAR1. Although, its molecular interactions and downstream targets have not been fully elucidated, TAAR1 activation triggers accumulation of intracellular cAMP, modulates PKA and PKC signaling and interferes with the \u03b2-arrestin2-dependent pathway via G protein-independent mechanisms. TAAR1 is uniquely positioned to exert direct control over DA and 5-HT neuronal firing and release, which has profound implications for understanding the pathophysiology of, and therefore designing more efficacious therapeutic interventions for, a range of neuropsychiatric disorders that involve aminergic dysregulation, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, mood disorders, and addiction. Indeed, the recent development of novel pharmacological tools targeting TAAR1 has uncovered the remarkable potential of TAAR1-based medications as new generation pharmacotherapies in neuropsychiatry. This review summarizes recent developments in the study of TAs and TAAR1, their intricate neurochemistry and pharmacology, and their relevance for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease. Functional interaction between trace amine-associated receptor\ninteraction plays in D2R-related signaling and behaviors. Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer biosensor for cAMP, we demonstrated that the D2R antagonists haloperidol, raclopride, and amisulpride were able to enhance selectively a TAAR1-mediated \u03b2-PEA increase of cAMP. Moreover, TAAR1 and D2R were able to form heterodimers when coexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and this direct interaction was disrupted in the presence of haloperidol. In addition, in mice lacking TAAR1, haloperidol-induced striatal c-Fos expression and catalepsy were significantly reduced. Taken together, these data suggest that TAAR1 and D2R have functional and physical interactions that could be critical for the modulation of the dopaminergic system by TAAR1 in vivo. Recognition of methamphetamine and other amines by trace amine receptor TAAR1. Trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), the founding member of a nine-member family of trace amine receptors, is responsible for recognizing a range of biogenic amines in the brain, including the\nnine-member family of trace amine receptors, is responsible for recognizing a range of biogenic amines in the brain, including the endogenous \u03b2-phenylethylamine (\u03b2-PEA)1 as well as methamphetamine2, an abused substance that has posed a severe threat to human health and society3. Given its unique physiological role in the brain, TAAR1 is also an emerging target for a range of neurological disorders including schizophrenia, depression and drug addiction2,4,5. Here we report structures of human TAAR1-G-protein complexes bound to methamphetamine and \u03b2-PEA as well as complexes bound to RO5256390, a TAAR1-selective agonist, and SEP-363856, a clinical-stage dual agonist for TAAR1 and serotonin receptor 5-HT1AR (refs. 6,7). Together with systematic mutagenesis and functional studies, the structures reveal the molecular basis of methamphetamine recognition and underlying mechanisms of ligand selectivity and polypharmacology between TAAR1 and other monoamine receptors. We identify a lid-like extracellular loop 2 helix/loop structure and a hydrogen-bonding network in the ligand-binding\neffect. Anapyrexia has been observed to be related to action on aminergic receptors such as the serotonin receptor 1b (5-HT1b). This receptor primarily activates the Gi/o mediated pathway and PLC signaling through the G\u03b2\u03b3 of Gi/o. Since the expression profiles of TAAR1 and 5-HT1b overlap, we questioned whether 3-T1AM may activate 5-HT1b. Finally, we also evaluated heteromerization between these two GPCRs and tested signaling under co-expressed conditions. In this study, we showed, that 3-T1AM can induce Gi/o signaling through 5-HT1b in a concentration of 10 \u03bcM. Strikingly, at 5-HT1b the ligand 3-T1AM only activates the Gi/o mediated reduction of cAMP accumulation, but not PLC activation. Co-stimulation of 5-HT1b by both ligands did not lead to additive or synergistic signaling effects. In addition, we confirmed the capacity for heteromerization between TAAR1 and 5-HT1b. Under co-expression of TAAR1 and HTR1b, 3-T1AM action is only mediated via TAAR1 and activation of 5-HT1b is\nand 5-HT1b. Under co-expression of TAAR1 and HTR1b, 3-T1AM action is only mediated via TAAR1 and activation of 5-HT1b is abrogated. In conclusion, we found evidence for 5-HT1b as a new receptor target for 3-T1AM, albeit with a different signaling effect than the endogenous ligand. Altogether, this indicates a complex interrelation of signaling effects between the investigated GPCRs and respective ligands.\nrecently discovered nonolfactory expression and therapeutic potential, TAAR5 has been the focus of deorphanization campaigns that led to the discovery of a few druglike antagonists. Here, we report four novel TAAR5 antagonists identified through high-throughput screening, which, along with the four ligands published in the literature, constituted our starting point to design a computational strategy for the identification of TAAR5 ligands. We developed a structure-based virtual screening protocol that allowed us to identify three new TAAR5 antagonists with a hit rate of 10%. Despite lacking an experimental structure, we accurately modeled the TAAR5 binding site by integrating comparative sequence- and structure-based analyses of serotonin receptors with homology modeling and side-chain optimization. In summary, we have identified seven new TAAR5 antagonists that could serve as lead candidates for the development of new treatments for depression, anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases. The Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1 Agonist 3-Iodothyronamine Induces Biased Signaling at the\nsynaptosomes. VMAT2-mediated [3H]DA uptake inhibition was increased in Taar1 KO mice in synaptosomal and vesicular fractions, but not the membrane-associated fraction, compared with Taar1 WT mice. There was no difference in [3H]dihydrotetrabenazine binding to the VMAT2 or [125I]RTI-55 binding to the DAT between genotypes, indicating activation of TAAR1 does not affect VMAT2 or DAT expression. There was also no difference between Taar1 WT and KO mice in DAT-mediated [3H]DA uptake inhibition following in vitro treatment with MA. These findings provide the first evidence of a TAAR1-VMAT2 interaction, as activation of TAAR1 mitigated MA-induced impairment of VMAT2 function, independently of change in VMAT2 expression. Additionally, the interaction is localized to intracellular VMAT2 on cytosolic vesicles and did not affect expression or function of DAT in synaptosomes or VMAT2 at the plasmalemmal surface, i.e., on membrane-associated vesicles.

Identification of the von Hippel-lindau tumor-suppressor protein as part of an active E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Mutations of von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) tumor-suppressor gene product (pVHL) are found in patients with dominant inherited VHL syndrome and in the vast majority of sporadic clear cell renal carcinomas. The function of the pVHL protein has not been clarified. pVHL has been shown to form a complex with elongin B and elongin C (VBC) and with cullin (CUL)-2. In light of the structural analogy of VBC-CUL-2 to SKP1-CUL-1-F-box ubiquitin ligases, the ubiquitin ligase activity of VBC-CUL-2 was examined in this study.

The HECT E3 ligase family comprises three subfamilies: NEDD4 E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (NEDD4), HECT and RLD domain-containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (HERC), and \"other.\" Most previous studies have focused on the NEDD4 subfamily. Apoptosis-resistant E3 ligase 1 (AREL1) belongs to \"other\" subfamily HECT that inhibits apoptosis by ubiquitinating and degrading proapoptotic proteins. Here, we report the crystal structure of the extended HECT domain of AREL1 (amino acids (aa) 436-823) at 2.4 \u00c5 resolution and its ubiquitination of the proapoptotic protein second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC). We found that the extended HECT domain adopts an inverted, T-shaped, bilobed conformation and harbors an additional loop (aa 567-573) absent in all other HECT members. We also show that the N-terminal extended region (aa 436-482) preceding the HECT domain is indispensable for its stability and activity and that without this region, the\nof VBC-CUL-2 to SKP1-CUL-1-F-box ubiquitin ligases, the ubiquitin ligase activity of VBC-CUL-2 was examined in this study. We show that VBC-CUL-2 exhibits ubiquitin ligase activity, and we identified UbcH5a, b, and c, but not CDC34, as the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes of the VBC-CUL-2 ubiquitin ligase. The protein Rbx1/ROC1 enhances ligase activity of VBC-CUL-2 as it does in the SKP1-CUL-1-F-box protein ligase complex. We also found that pVHL associates with two proteins, p100 and p220, which migrate at a similar molecular weight as two major bands in the ubiquitination assay. Furthermore, naturally occurring pVHL missense mutations, including mutants capable of forming a complex with elongin B-elongin C-CUL-2, fail to associate with p100 and p220 and cannot exhibit the E3 ligase activity. These results suggest that pVHL might be the substrate recognition subunit of the VBC-CUL-2 E3 ligase. This is also, to our knowledge, the first example of a human tumor-suppressor protein being\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.

Ubiquitin ligases play a pivotal role in substrate recognition and ubiquitin transfer, yet little is known about the regulation of their catalytic activity. Nedd4 (neural-precursor-cell-expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4)-2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase composed of a C2 domain, four WW domains (protein-protein interaction domains containing two conserved tryptophan residues) that bind PY motifs (L/PPXY) and a ubiquitin ligase HECT (homologous with E6-associated protein C-terminus) domain. In the present paper we show that the WW domains of Nedd4-2 bind (weakly) to a PY motif (LPXY) located within its own HECT domain and inhibit\nbetween the E6 protein and E6AP is one example of how a HECT E3 ligase is activated and altered to ubiquitinate a specific substrate through binding of an adaptor protein. Modes of regulating HECT E3 ligase function. Mechanisms that can regulate or modulate HECT E3 ligase function are: (1) recruitment of substrate and activity modulation by adaptor proteins/co-activators, (2) recruitment of E2, (3) intramolecular interaction between an N-terminal domain and the HECT domain, (4) intermolecular interaction/oligomerization, (5) post-translational modification, and (6) ubiquitin binding to the \u201cexosite\u201d on the HECT domain. For details see text The interaction with adaptor proteins, such as the interaction of E6 with E6AP, can not only change the substrate specificity of HECT E3s but also alter the structure of the ubiquitin polymers they conjugate to the substrates. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are also prevalent in the alteration of HECT E3 ligase functionality such as phosphorylation and the\ndomain The C2 domain of the Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase binds membrane phosphoinositides and directs ubiquitination of endosomal cargo Binding of RhoA by the C2 domain of E3 ligase Smurf1 is essential for Smurf1-regulated RhoA ubiquitination and cell protrusive activity Smurf1 directly targets hPEM-2, a GEF for Cdc42, via a novel combination of protein interaction modules in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway Autoinhibition of the HECT-type ubiquitin ligase Smurf2 through its C2 domain WW domains provide a platform for the assembly of multiprotein networks Itch WW domains inhibit its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity by blocking E2\u2013E3 ligase trans-thiolation Catalysis of guanine nucleotide exchange on Ran by the mitotic regulator RCC1 Chromatin-independent nuclear envelope assembly induced by Ran GTPase in Xenopus egg extracts Chromatin docking and exchange activity enhancement of RCC1 by histones H2A and H2B Functional and pathological relevance of HERC family proteins: a decade later Zn-binding AZUL domain of human ubiquitin protein\ninteractions The inflammation-associated Salmonella SopA is a HECT-like E3 ubiquitin ligase Herc5, an interferon-induced HECT E3 enzyme, is required for conjugation of ISG15 in human cells HERC5 is an IFN-induced HECT-type E3 protein ligase that mediates type I IFN-induced ISGylation of protein targets HERC6 is the main E3 ligase for global ISG15 conjugation in mouse cells System-wide modulation of HECT E3 ligases with selective ubiquitin variant probes Structure of an E6AP\u2013UbcH7 complex: insights into ubiquitination by the E2\u2013E3 enzyme cascade Insights into ubiquitin transfer cascades from a structure of a UbcH5B approximately ubiquitin-HECT(NEDD4L) complex Conformational flexibility underlies ubiquitin ligation mediated by the WWP1 HECT domain E3 ligase E2 conjugating enzymes must disengage from their E1 enzymes before E3-dependent ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like transfer C2-domains, structure and function of a universal Ca2+-binding domain The C2 domain of the Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase binds membrane phosphoinositides and directs ubiquitination of endosomal cargo Binding of\nevents, including protein degradation, cell cycle, transcription, DNA repair, and apoptosis.[ ] The ubiquitination process involves the sequential enzymatic activities of E1 (ubiquitin\u2010activating), E2 (ubiquitin\u2010conjugating), and E3 (ubiquitin ligase) enzymes.[ ] Ubiquitin is activated by the E1 enzyme, and then complexed with the E2 enzyme through the creation of a E2\u2013Ub thioester. Subsequently, E3\u2010ubiquitin ligase specifically binds to or interacts with the substrate and the E2\u2013Ub thioester to mediate the ubiquitin transfer to the substrate lysine residue. E3 ubiquitin ligases are classified into three different families based on the mechanism of ubiquitin transfer: RING\u2010type (Really Interesting New Gene), RBR\u2010type (RING\u2010Between RING), and HECT\u2010type (Homologous to the E6AP C\u2010terminus). HECT\u2010type E3 ligases assemble linkage\u2010specific polyubiquitin chains on substrate proteins, and their aberrant activity has been linked with multiple diseases, including cancer.[ ] A total of 28 members make up the HECT E3 ligase family, which is further subdivided into three subfamilies\nproline-rich ligand that differs from the consensus established for Src homology 3-binding modules Regulation of functional diversity within the Nedd4 family by accessory and adaptor proteins The tumor suppressor, PTEN/MMAC1, dephosphorylates the lipid second messenger, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate Tenets of PTEN tumor suppression Ndfip1 regulates nuclear Pten import in vivo to promote neuronal survival following cerebral ischemia WWP2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for PTEN Ubiquitination regulates PTEN nuclear import and tumor suppression Regulation of PTEN degradation and NEDD4\u20131 E3 ligase activity by Numb Ndfip1 protein promotes the function of itch ubiquitin ligase to prevent T cell activation and T helper 2 cell-mediated inflammation A PPxY motif within the VP40 protein of Ebola virus interacts physically and functionally with a ubiquitin ligase: implications for filovirus budding Ebola virus matrix protein VP40 interaction with human cellular factors Tsg101 and Nedd4 Nedd4 regulates egress of Ebola virus-like particles from host cells Itch E3\nand H2B Functional and pathological relevance of HERC family proteins: a decade later Zn-binding AZUL domain of human ubiquitin protein ligase Ube3A Localization of the E6-AP regions that direct human papillomavirus E6 binding, association with p53, and ubiquitination of associated proteins ARF-BP1/Mule is a critical mediator of the ARF tumor suppressor Transcription-independent ARF regulation in oncogenic stress-mediated p53 responses Mechanisms of human papillomavirus-induced oncogenesis Both Rb and E7 are regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway in HPV-containing cervical tumor cells Targeting retinoblastoma protein for degradation by proteasomes Human papillomavirus type 16 E7 oncoprotein associates with the cullin 2 ubiquitin ligase complex, which contributes to degradation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor Conserved region 3 of human papillomavirus 16 E7 contributes to deregulation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor Structural basis for hijacking of cellular LxxLL motifs by papillomavirus E6 oncoproteins HPV E6, E6AP and cervical cancer Telomerase activation by the E6 gene\ndiscovery Development of inhibitors in the ubiquitination cascade Ubiquitin ligases: structure, function, and regulation The ubiquitin code A cellular protein mediates association of p53 with the E6 oncoprotein of human papillomavirus types 16 or 18 The HPV-16 E6 and E6-AP complex functions as a ubiquitin-protein ligase in the ubiquitination of p53 A family of proteins structurally and functionally related to the E6-AP ubiquitin-protein ligase UBE3A/E6-AP mutations cause Angelman syndrome De novo truncating mutations in E6-AP ubiquitin-protein ligase gene (UBE3A) in Angelman syndrome The E6 oncoprotein encoded by human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 promotes the degradation of p53 Two distinct activities contribute to human papillomavirus 16 E6\u2019s oncogenic potential Tyrosine phosphorylation of NEDD4 activates its ubiquitin ligase activity The covalent modifier Nedd8 is critical for the activation of Smurf1 ubiquitin ligase in tumorigenesis The ubiquitin ligase Smurf2 suppresses TGF\u03b2-induced epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition in a sumoylation-regulated manner Structural mechanisms of HECT-type ubiquitin\nItch/AIP4 mediates Deltex degradation through the formation of K29-linked polyubiquitin chains Ubiquitin modifications The ubiquitin binding region of the Smurf HECT domain facilitates polyubiquitylation and binding of ubiquitylated substrates Structure of the HECT:ubiquitin complex and its role in ubiquitin chain elongation A small molecule that switches a ubiquitin ligase from a processive to a distributive enzymatic mechanism The N-end rule pathway is mediated by a complex of the RING-type Ubr1 and HECT-type Ufd4 ubiquitin ligases Synthesis of isomeric phosphoubiquitin chains reveals that phosphorylation controls deubiquitinase activity and specificity Expanding the ubiquitin code through post-translational modification Ubiquitin is phosphorylated by PINK1 to activate parkin Proteomic techniques to probe the ubiquitin landscape InterPro in 2017\u2014beyond protein family and domain annotations The MLLE domain of the ubiquitin ligase UBR5 binds to its catalytic domain to regulate substrate binding.

Interestingly, however, a recent screen for ubiquitin variants (UbVs) with increased affinity for the exosite has provided useful insights as to how HECT domain activity can be regulated and modulated. Detailed biochemical analysis and HECT-UbV co-crystallization experiments revealed that UbV binding at the N-lobe exosite could modulate E3 ligase activity through a variety of mechanisms. For example, binding of the UbV to the NEDD4.2 and Rsp5 exosite promoted the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to E3, whereas other UbV interactions promoted ubiquitin transfer from E3 to the substrate. Another two UbVs were shown to modulate NEDD4.2 activity by decreasing processivity and increasing distributive multi-mono-ubiquitination. As the engineered UbVs are highly specific for one HECT E3 by way of their design and selection process, their specificity may be useful to target and modulate a specific HECT E3 ligase without affecting other",

Our molecular modelling studies of this phenomenon revealed that even within the family of related enzymes substantial differences may exist in the geometry of the active site. In the case of the glutamine amidotransferase family the glutamine binding site of GlcN-6-P synthase fits a different region of the glutamine conformational space than other amidotransferases. Detailed analysis of the interaction pattern for the best known, so far, inhibitor of the sugar isomerising domain, namely 2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucitol-6-phosphate (ADGP), allowed us to suggest changes in the structure of the inhibitor that should improve the interaction pattern. The novel ligand was designed and synthesised. Biological experiments confirmed our predictions. The new compound named ADMP is a much better inhibitor of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase than ADGP. Preliminary X-ray analysis of Escherichia coli GMP synthetase:\nmore than one binding site. Interaction of GMP synthetase with xanthosine 5'-monophosphate (XMP), a substrate, exhibits sigmoidal kinetics with a Hill coefficient of 1.48 +/- 0.07. This positive cooperativity is not due to ligand-induced oligomerization, since GMP synthetase remains a monomer in the presence of XMP and other substrates. Decoyinine, a selective inhibitor of GMP synthetase, inhibits the human enzyme reversibly with uncompetitive inhibition kinetics toward glutamine and XMP and non-competitive kinetics toward ATP. Three-dimensional structure of Escherichia coli asparagine synthetase B: a short journey from substrate to product. Asparagine synthetase B catalyzes the assembly of asparagine from aspartate, Mg(2+)ATP, and glutamine. Here, we describe the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme from Escherichia colidetermined and refined to 2.0 A resolution. Protein employed for this study was that of a site-directed mutant protein, Cys1Ala. Large crystals were grown in the presence of both glutamine and AMP. Each subunit of the dimeric\nlaboratory we proposed the enzyme L-glutamine: D-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (EC 2.6.1.16) as a new target for antifungals. The structure of this enzyme consists of two domains, N-terminal and C-terminal ones, catalysing glutamine hydrolysis and sugar-phosphate isomerisation, respectively. In our laboratory a series of potent selective inhibitors of GlcN-6-P synthase have been designed and synthesised. One group of these compounds, including the most studied N3-(4-methoxyfumaroyl)-l-2,3-diaminopropanoic acid (FMDP), behave like glutamine analogs acting as active-site-directed inactivators, blocking the N-terminal, glutamine-binding domain of the enzyme. The second group of GlcN-6-P synthase inhibitors mimic the transition state of the reaction taking place in the C-terminal sugar isomerising domain. Surprisingly, in spite of the fact that glutamine is the source of nitrogen for a number of enzymes it turned out that the glutamine analogue FMDP and its derivatives are selective against GlcN-6-P synthase and they do not block other enzymes, even belonging to the same family\nsubstrate. This site appears essential for coupling of the glutamine hydrolysis and ammonia transfer steps and is the first example of a site remote to the catalytic triad that modulates the process. The results are discussed in the context of recent X-ray crystal structures of glutamine amidotransferases that relate the glutamine binding and acceptor binding sites. Mechanistic Insights into the Functioning of a Two-Subunit GMP Synthetase, an Allosterically Regulated, Ammonia Channeling Enzyme. Guanosine 5'-monophosphate (GMP) synthetases, enzymes that catalyze the conversion of xanthosine 5'-monophosphate (XMP) to GMP, are composed of two different catalytic units, which are either two domains of a polypeptide chain or two subunits that associate to form a complex. The glutamine amidotransferase (GATase) unit hydrolyzes glutamine generating ammonia, and the ATP pyrophosphatase (ATPPase) unit catalyzes the formation of an AMP-XMP intermediate. The substrate-bound ATPPase allosterically activates GATase, and the ammonia thus generated is tunneled to the ATPPase\nglycine residues with isoleucine. However, these mutations only have minor effects on the kinetic properties of the enzyme. The second group includes L153W, L153G/N154G, and a ternary complex consisting of the intact large subunit plus the separate N- and C-terminal domains of the small subunit. Although the ability to synthesize carbamoyl phosphate is retained in these enzymes, the hydrolysis of glutamine is partially uncoupled from the synthetase reaction. It is concluded that the hinge loop, but not the type-II turn structure of the loop per se, is important for maintaining the proper interface interactions between the two subunits and the catalytic coupling of the partial reactions occurring within the separate subunits of CPS. Biochemical characterization of human GMP synthetase. GMP synthetase (EC 6.3.5.2) plays a key role in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides. It is a potential target for immunosuppressive therapy. Recently, the human enzyme was purified to\nnamed ADMP is a much better inhibitor of glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase than ADGP. Preliminary X-ray analysis of Escherichia coli GMP synthetase: determination of anomalous scattering factors for a cysteinyl mercury derivative. We have initiated a project to determine the three-dimensional structure of GMP synthetase (GMPS) from Escherichia coli. GMPS catalyzes the conversion of XMP to GMP in the final step of de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis, and is a member of the glutamine amidotransferase family: a group of enzymes responsible for the assimilation of nitrogen into compounds such as amino acids, purine and pyrimidine bases, amino sugars, and antibiotics. The E. coli guaA gene encoding GMPS was cloned into a tac expression vector, overexpressed, and its gene product purified. Conditions for the growth of protein crystals were developed using recombinant GMPS in the presence of MgCl2, ATP, and XMP. The crystals are monoclinic, space group P2(1), with cell parameters of a\nstructure determination by multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction was evaluated. The optimal MAD dispersive signal is 4.5% of magnitude of F, and the optimal MAD Bijvoet signal is 7.5% of magnitude of F at a concentration of approximately 1 mercury per 10-kDa protein. The anomalous scattering factors tabulated here should be transferable to cysteinyl mercury in other proteins. GMP Synthetase: Allostery, Structure, and Function. Glutamine amidotransferases (GATs) catalyze the hydrolysis of glutamine and transfer the generated ammonia to diverse metabolites. The two catalytic activities, glutaminolysis and the subsequent amination of the acceptor substrate, happen in two distinct catalytic pockets connected by a channel that facilitates the movement of ammonia. The de novo pathway for the synthesis of guanosine monophosphate (GMP) from xanthosine monophosphate (XMP) is enabled by the GAT GMP synthetase (GMPS). In most available crystal structures of GATs, the ammonia channel is evident in their native state or upon ligand binding,\nCrystal structure of the ATPPase subunit and its substrate-dependent association with the GATase subunit: a novel regulatory mechanism for a two-subunit-type GMP synthetase from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3. Guanosine 5'-monophosphate synthetase(s) (GMPS) catalyzes the final step of the de novo synthetic pathway of purine nucleotides. GMPS consists of two functional units that are present as domains or subunits: glutamine amidotransferase (GATase) and ATP pyrophosphatase (ATPPase). GATase hydrolyzes glutamine to yield glutamate and ammonia, while ATPPase utilizes ammonia to convert adenyl xanthosine 5'-monophosphate (adenyl-XMP) into guanosine 5'-monophosphate. Here we report the crystal structure of PH-ATPPase (the ATPPase subunit of the two-subunit-type GMPS from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3). PH-ATPPase consists of two domains (N-domain and C-domain) and exists as a homodimer in the crystal and in solution. The N-domain contains an ATP-binding platform called P-loop, whereas the C-domain contains the xanthosine 5'-monophosphate (XMP)-binding site and also contributes to homodimerization. We have\nintramolecular transfer of ammonia over a predicted distance of 46 A from one active site to another within Qns1 monomers. Conformational changes involving ammonia tunnel formation and allosteric control in GMP synthetase. GMP synthetase is the glutamine amidotransferase that catalyzes the final step in the guanylate branch of de novo purine biosynthesis. Conformational changes are required to efficiently couple distal active sites in the protein; however, the nature of these changes has remained elusive. Structural information derived from both limited proteolysis and sedimentation velocity experiments support the hypothesis of nucleotide-induced loop- and domain-closure in the protein. These results were combined with information from sequence conservation and precedents from other glutamine amidotransferases to develop the first structural model of GMPS in a closed, active state. In analyzing this Catalytic model, an interdomain salt bridge was identified residing in the same location as seen in other triad glutamine amidotransferases. Using mutagenesis and\nreduced sulfhydryl group(s) is not only essential for amidotransferase activity but also for the formation of the aggregate as well. The following model is proposed to explain these results. Free subunit Xre does not bind DON or glutamine to the catalytically functional sulfhydryl group. Upon aggregation with subunit E, however, the glutamine or DON binds to the glutamine catalytic site on subunit Xre and amidotransfer or alkylation occurs. An EX complex which has been alkylated by DON can be readily dissociated and it is suggested that following catalysis the EX complex may also dissociate. Glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase, a novel target for antifungal agents. Molecular modelling studies in drug design. Fungal infections are a growing problem in contemporary medicine, yet only a few antifungal agents are used in clinical practice. In our laboratory we proposed the enzyme L-glutamine: D-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (EC 2.6.1.16) as a new target for antifungals. The structure of this\nXre is rapidly inactivated by p-chloromercuribenzoate and bromopyruvate, whereas subunit Xox, which is not catalytically functional in amidotransferase activity, is not affected. The glutamine analogue 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) has no effect on Xre alone but rapidly inactivates the EXre complex. DON-inactivated subunit X cannot be reactivated by 2-mercaptoethanol but can be readily displaced from subunit E by free subunit Xre. The integrity of the EXre complex is maintained following gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 in the presence of glutamine and 2-mercaptoethanol, thus the binding of glutamine to the complex does not require the binding of other substrates. Subunit Xox, however, does not aggregate with subunit E since no EXox complex is found following gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 in the presence of glutamine and in the absence of 2-mercaptoethanol. Thus, a reduced sulfhydryl group(s) is not only essential for amidotransferase activity but also for the formation of the aggregate as well.\n272, Leu 232, and Gly 347. As observed for other amidotransferases, the two active sites are connected by a tunnel lined primarily with backbone atoms and hydrophobic and nonpolar amino acid residues. Strikingly, the three-dimensional architecture of the N-terminal domain of asparagine synthetase B is similar to that observed for glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase while the molecular motif of the C-domain is reminiscent to that observed for GMP synthetase.\nto various cellular metabolites, are modular, with the amidotransferase (GATase) domain hydrolyzing Gln, generating ammonia and the acceptor domain catalyzing the addition of nitrogen onto its cognate substrate. GMP synthetase (GMPS), an enzyme in the de novo purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway, is a glutamine amidotransferase that catalyzes the synthesis of GMP from XMP. The reaction involves activation of XMP though adenylation by ATP in the ATP pyrophosphatase (ATPPase) active site, followed by channeling and attack of NH3 generated in the GATase pocket. This complex chemistry entails co-ordination of activity across the active sites, allosteric activation of the GATase domain to modulate Gln hydrolysis and channeling of ammonia from the GATase to the acceptor active site. Functional GMPS dimers associate through the dimerization domain. The crystal structure of the Gln-bound complex of Plasmodium falciparum GMPS (PfGMPS) for the first time revealed large-scale domain rotation to be associated with catalysis and leading\nphosphate (IGP) synthase, a triad glutamine amidotransferase, catalyzes the fifth step in the histidine biosynthetic pathway, where ammonia from glutamine is incorporated into N1-[(5'-phosphoribulosyl)-formimino]-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (PRFAR) to yield IGP and 5'-(5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide) ribonucleotide (AICAR). The triad family of glutamine amidotransferases is formed by the coupling of two disparate subdomains, an acceptor domain and a glutamine hydrolysis domain. Each of the enzymes in this family share a common glutaminase domain for which the glutaminase activity is tightly regulated by an acceptor substrate domain. In IGP synthase the glutaminase and PRFAR binding sites are separated by 30 A. Using kinetic analyses of site-specific mutants and molecular dynamic simulations, we have determined that an interdomain salt bridge in IGP synthase between D359 and K196 (approximately 16 A from the PRFAR binding site) plays a key role in mediating communication between the two active sites. This interdomain contact modulates the glutaminase loop containing the histidine\ninterdomain salt bridge was identified residing in the same location as seen in other triad glutamine amidotransferases. Using mutagenesis and kinetic analysis, the salt bridge between H186 and E383 was shown to function as a connection between the two active sites. Mutations at these residues uncoupled the two half-reactions of the enzyme. The chemical events of nucleotide binding initiate a series of conformational changes that culminate in the establishment of a tunnel for ammonia as well as an activated glutaminase catalytic site. The results of this study provide a clearer understanding of the allostery of GMPS, where, for the first time, key substrate binding and interdomain contacts are modeled and analyzed. Tertiary and Quaternary Structure Organization in GMP Synthetases: Implications for Catalysis. Glutamine amidotransferases, enzymes that transfer nitrogen from Gln to various cellular metabolites, are modular, with the amidotransferase (GATase) domain hydrolyzing Gln, generating ammonia and the acceptor domain catalyzing\nATP-binding platform called P-loop, whereas the C-domain contains the xanthosine 5'-monophosphate (XMP)-binding site and also contributes to homodimerization. We have also demonstrated that PH-GATase (the glutamine amidotransferase subunit of the two-subunit-type GMPS from the hyperthermophilic archaeon P. horikoshii OT3) alone is inactive, and that all substrates of PH-ATPPase except for ammonia (Mg(2+), ATP and XMP) are required to stabilize the active complex of PH-ATPPase and PH-GATase subunits. Interactions of GMP with Human Glrx3 and with Saccharomyces cerevisiae Grx3 and Grx4 Converge in the Regulation of the Gcn2 Pathway. The human monothiol glutaredoxin Glrx3 (PICOT) is ubiquitously distributed in cytoplasm and nuclei in mammalian cells. Its overexpression has been associated with the development of several types of tumors, whereas its deficiency might cause retardation in embryogenesis. Its exact biological role has not been well resolved, although a function as a chaperone distributing iron/sulfur clusters is currently accepted. Yeast humanization and the\ndefect in guanine nucleotide biosynthesis evokes a reduction in the rate of general protein synthesis by impairing multiple steps of the process, disrupts the gene-specific reinitiation mechanism for translation of GCN4 mRNA and has far-reaching effects in cell biology and metabolism. Substrate activation and conformational dynamics of guanosine 5'-monophosphate synthetase. Glutamine amidotransferases catalyze the amination of a wide range of molecules using the amide nitrogen of glutamine. The family provides numerous examples for study of multi-active-site regulation and interdomain communication in proteins. Guanosine 5'-monophosphate synthetase (GMPS) is one of three glutamine amidotransferases in de novo purine biosynthesis and is responsible for the last step in the guanosine branch of the pathway, the amination of xanthosine 5'-monophosphate (XMP). In several amidotransferases, the intramolecular path of ammonia from glutamine to substrate is understood; however, the crystal structure of GMPS only hinted at the details of such transfer. Rapid kinetics studies provide insight\nkey role in mediating communication between the two active sites. This interdomain contact modulates the glutaminase loop containing the histidine and glutamic acid of the catalytic triad to control glutamine hydrolysis. We propose this to be a general principle of catalytic coupling that may be applied to the entire triad glutamine amidotransferase family. Subunit interactions and glutamine utilization by Escherichia coli imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase. A selection strategy has been developed to identify amino acid residues involved in subunit interactions that coordinate the two half-reactions catalyzed by glutamine amidotransferases. The protein structures known for this class of enzymes have revealed that ammonia is shuttled over long distances and that each amidotransferase evolved different molecular tunnels for this purpose. The heterodimeric Escherichia coli imidazole glycerol phosphate (IGP) synthase was probed to assess if residues in the substrate amination subunit (HisF) are critical for the glutaminase activity in the HisH subunit. The\nammonia-dependent. Earlier, we discovered that glutamine-dependent NAD+ synthetases contain N-terminal domains that are members of the nitrilase superfamily and hypothesized that these domains function as glutamine amidotransferases for the associated synthetases. Here we show yeast glutamine-dependent NAD+ synthetase Qns1 requires both the nitrilase-related active-site residues and the NAD+ synthetase active-site residues for function in vivo. Despite failure to complement the lethal phenotype of qns1 disruption, the former mutants retain ammonia-dependent NAD+ synthetase activity in vitro, whereas the latter mutants retain basal glutaminase activity. Moreover, the two classes of mutants fail to trans-complement despite forming a stable heteromultimer in vivo. These data indicate that the nitrilase-related domain in Qns1 is the fourth independently evolved glutamine amidotransferase domain to have been identified in nature and that glutamine-dependence is an obligate phenomenon involving intramolecular transfer of ammonia over a predicted distance of 46 A from one active site to another within Qns1 monomers.\nnovo synthesis of guanine nucleotides. It is a potential target for immunosuppressive therapy. Recently, the human enzyme was purified to homogeneity (Hirst, M., Haliday, E., Nakamura, J., and Lou, L. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 23830-23837). We now report the characterization of this enzyme in terms of its biochemical and kinetic properties. We found that there are distinct features of the human enzyme that has not been reported for GMP synthetase from other sources. There are two variant forms of human GMP synthetase. Their catalytic properties are very similar, although their isoelectric points are different. They most likely represent post-translational modification variants. Magnesium ion is required for enzyme activity, and the requirement is beyond levels needed for ATP chelation. Magnesium appears to be an essential activator and there may be more than one binding site.

However, beta, gamma-difluoromethyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate (AMP-PCF2P), a potent inhibitor of GK, bound nonproductively in the closed subunit and in a putative productive conformation in the open subunit, with the gamma-phosphate placed for in-line transfer to glycerol. This asymmetry is consistent with \"half-of-the-sites\" reactivity and suggests that the inhibition of GK by FBP is due to restriction of domain motion. Escherichia coli glycerol kinase: role of a tetramer interface in regulation by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and phosphotransferase system regulatory protein IIIglc. Escherichia coli glycerol kinase (EC 2.7.1.30; ATP:glycerol 3-phosphotransferase) is a key element in a signal transduction pathway that couples expression of genes required for glycerol metabolism to the relative availability of glycerol and glucose. Its catalytic activity is inhibited by protein-protein interactions with IIIglc, a phosphotransferase system protein, and by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP); each of these\nwere partially rescued by treatment with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin. GK5 exists as part of a skin-specific regulatory mechanism for cholesterol biosynthesis, independent of cholesterol regulation elsewhere in the body. IIA(Glc) allosteric control of Escherichia coli glycerol kinase: binding site cooperative transitions and cation-promoted association by Zinc(II). The catalytic activity of glycerol kinase (EC 2.7.1.30, ATP:glycerol 3-phosphotransferase) from Escherichia coli is inhibited allosterically by IIA(Glc) (previously known as III(Glc)), the glucose-specific phosphocarrier protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system. A sequentially contiguous portion of glycerol kinase undergoes an induced fit conformational change involving coil, alpha-helix, and 3(10)-helix upon IIA(Glc) binding. A second induced fit occurs upon binding of Zn(II) to a novel intermolecular site, which increases complex stability by cation-promoted association. Eight of the ten sequentially contiguous amino acids are substituted with alanine to evaluate the roles of these positions in complex formation. Effects of the substitutions reveal both favorable\nSkin-specific regulation of SREBP processing and lipid biosynthesis by glycerol kinase 5. The recessive N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced phenotype toku is characterized by delayed hair growth, progressive hair loss, and excessive accumulation of dermal cholesterol, triglycerides, and ceramides. The toku phenotype was attributed to a null allele of Gk5, encoding glycerol kinase 5 (GK5), a skin-specific kinase expressed predominantly in sebaceous glands. GK5 formed a complex with the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) through their C-terminal regulatory domains, inhibiting SREBP processing and activation. In Gk5toku/toku mice, transcriptionally active SREBPs accumulated in the skin, but not in the liver; they were localized to the nucleus and led to elevated lipid synthesis and subsequent hair growth defects. Similar defective hair growth was observed in kinase-inactive GK5 mutant mice. Hair growth defects of homozygous toku mice were partially rescued by treatment with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin. GK5 exists as part of a skin-specific regulatory mechanism\nrole of tetramer assembly, a mutation (Ser58-->Trp) was designed to sterically block formation of the dimer-dimer interface near the FBP binding site [Ormo, M., Bystrom, C., and Remington, S. J. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 16565-16572]. The substitution did not substantially change the Michaelis constants or alter allosteric regulation of GK by a second effector, the phosphocarrier protein IIAGlc; however, it eliminated FBP inhibition. Crystal structures of GK in complex with different nontransferable ATP analogues and glycerol revealed an asymmetric dimer with one subunit adopting an open conformation and the other adopting the closed conformation found in previously determined structures. The conformational difference is produced by a approximately 6.0 degrees rigid-body rotation of the N-terminal domain with respect to the C-terminal domain, similar to that observed for hexokinase and actin, members of the same ATPase superfamily. Two of the ATP analogues bound in nonproductive conformations in both subunits. However, beta, gamma-difluoromethyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate\nco-workers [Luque, I., and Freire, E.

These variants show also increased cation-promoted association by Zn(II) so that the energetic contribution of Zn(II) to complex formation is doubled. The similarity of effects of the alanine substitutions of the amino acids in the alpha-helical region for IIA(Glc) binding affinity and cation-promoted association by Zn(II) indicates that they function as a cooperative unit. Crystal structures of Escherichia coli glycerol kinase variant S58-->W in complex with nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues reveal a putative active conformation of the enzyme as a result of domain motion. Escherichia coli glycerol kinase (GK) displays \"half-of-the-sites\" reactivity toward ATP and allosteric regulation by fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate (FBP), which has been shown to promote dimer-tetramer assembly and to inhibit only tetramers. To probe the role of tetramer assembly, a mutation (Ser58-->Trp) was designed to sterically block formation of the dimer-dimer interface near the FBP\nactivity is inhibited by protein-protein interactions with IIIglc, a phosphotransferase system protein, and by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP); each of these allosteric effectors constitutes a positive signal that glucose is available. Loss of glucose inhibition of glycerol metabolism was used to screen for regulatory mutants of glycerol kinase after hydroxylamine mutagenesis of the cloned glpK gene. Two mutant enzymes were identified and shown by DNA sequencing to contain the mutations alanine 65 to threonine (A65T) and aspartate 72 to asparagine (D72N). Initial velocity studies show the mutations do not significantly affect the catalytic properties, hence active-site structures, of the enzymes. Both mutations decrease inhibition by FBP; A65T eliminates the inhibition while D72N appears to decrease the affinity for FBP and the extent of the inhibition. However, neither mutation significantly affects inhibition by IIIglc. Gel-permeation chromatography studies show that both of the mutations alter the dimer-tetramer assembly reaction of the enzyme and\nsubstituted with alanine to evaluate the roles of these positions in complex formation. Effects of the substitutions reveal both favorable and antagonistic contributions of the normal amino acids to complex formation, and Zn(II) reverses these contributions for two of the amino acids. The consequences of some of the substitutions for IIA(Glc) inhibition are consistent with changes in the intermolecular interactions seen in the crystal structures. However, for the amino acids that are located in the region that is alpha-helical in the absence of IIA(Glc), the effects of the substitutions are not consistent with changes in intermolecular interactions but with increased stability of the alpha-helical region due to the higher alpha-helix propensity of alanine. The reduced affinity for IIA(Glc) binding seen for these variants is consistent with predictions of Freire and co-workers [Luque, I., and Freire, E. (2000) Proteins: Struct., Funct., Genet. 4, 63-71]. These variants show also increased cation-promoted association\nby IIIglc. Gel-permeation chromatography studies show that both of the mutations alter the dimer-tetramer assembly reaction of the enzyme and the effect of FBP in increasing the molecular weight. The effects of the mutations on the assembly reaction are consistent with the locations of these two amino acid residues in the X-ray structure, which shows them to be associated with an alpha-helix that constitutes one of the two subunit-subunit interfaces within the tetramer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The CO group consumed significantly less food than the RO group. The CO group also had significantly higher levels of oxaloacetate and malate than the PO group.

Cloning and expression of the cDNA encoding human fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase, the enzyme deficient in hereditary tyrosinemia: assignment of the gene to chromosome 15. Type 1 hereditary tyrosinemia (HT) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH; E.C.3.7.1.2). We have isolated human FAH cDNA clones by screening a liver cDNA expression library using specific antibodies and plaque hybridization with a rat FAH cDNA probe. A 1,477-bp cDNA was sequenced and shown to code for FAH by an in vitro transcription-translation assay and sequence homology with tryptic fragments of purified FAH. Transient expression of this FAH cDNA in transfected CV-1 mammalian cells resulted in the synthesis of an immunoreactive protein comigrating with purified human liver FAH on SDS-PAGE and having enzymatic activity as shown by the hydrolysis of the natural substrate\nThe first study on the effect of crocodile oil from Crocodylus siamensis on hepatic mitochondrial function for energy homeostasis in rats. Background and Aim: Consumption of fatty acids (FA) can alter hepatic energy metabolism and mitochondrial function in the liver. Crocodile oil (CO) is rich in mono-and polyunsaturated FAs, which have natural anti-inflammatory and healing properties. In rat livers, we investigated the effect of CO on mitochondrial function for energy homeostasis.Materials and Methods: Twenty-one male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups at random. Group 1 rats were given sterile water (RO), Group 2 rats were given CO (3% v/w), and Group 3 rats were given palm oil (PO) (3% v/w). For 7 weeks, rats were given sterile water, CO, and PO orally. The researchers looked at body weight, food intake, liver weight, energy intake, blood lipid profiles, and mitochondria-targeted metabolites in the liver. The liver's histopathology, mitochondrial architecture, and\nion located in close proximity to a Glu-His dyad.CONCLUSIONS: FAH represents the first structure of a hydrolase that acts specifically on carbon-carbon bonds. FAH also defines a new class of metalloenzymes characterized by a unique alpha/beta fold. A mechanism involving a Glu-His-water catalytic triad is suggested based on structural observations, sequence conservation and mutational analysis. The histidine imidazole group is proposed to function as a general base. The Ca(2+) is proposed to function in binding substrate, activating the nucleophile and stabilizing a carbanion leaving group. An oxyanion hole formed from sidechains is proposed to stabilize a tetrahedral alkoxide transition state. The proton transferred to the carbanion leaving group is proposed to originate from a lysine sidechain. The results also reveal the molecular basis for mutations causing the hereditary tyrosinemia type 1.\nwith purified human liver FAH on SDS-PAGE and having enzymatic activity as shown by the hydrolysis of the natural substrate fumarylacetoacetate. This indicates that the single polypeptide chain encoded by the FAH gene contains all the genetic information required for functional activity, suggesting that the dimer found in vivo is a homodimer. The human FAH cDNA was used as a probe to determine the gene's chromosomal localization using somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization. The human FAH gene maps to the long arm of chromosome 15 in the region q23-q25. Crystal structure and mechanism of a carbon-carbon bond hydrolase. BACKGROUND: Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) catalyzes the final step of tyrosine and phenylalanine catabolism, the hydrolytic cleavage of a carbon-carbon bond in fumarylacetoacetate, to yield fumarate and acetoacetate. FAH has no known sequence homologs and functions by an unknown mechanism. Carbon-carbon hydrolysis reactions are essential for the human metabolism of aromatic\nknown sequence homologs and functions by an unknown mechanism. Carbon-carbon hydrolysis reactions are essential for the human metabolism of aromatic amino acids. FAH deficiency causes the fatal metabolic disease hereditary tyrosinemia type I. Carbon-carbon bond hydrolysis is also important in the microbial metabolism of aromatic compounds as part of the global carbon cycle.RESULTS: The FAH crystal structure has been determined by rapid, automated analysis of multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data. The FAH polypeptide folds into a 120-residue N-terminal domain and a 300-residue C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain defines an unusual beta-strand topology and a novel 'mixed beta-sandwich roll' structure. The structure of FAH complexed with its physiological products was also determined. This structure reveals fumarate binding near the entrance to the active site and acetoacetate binding to an octahedrally coordinated calcium ion located in close proximity to a Glu-His dyad.CONCLUSIONS: FAH represents the first structure of a hydrolase that acts specifically",

        "desc": "an important role in bidirectional communication between the plastid and the nucleus in high Glc. A single amino acid change converts the sugar sensor SGLT3 into a sugar transporter. BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose cotransporter proteins (SGLT) belong to the SLC5A family, characterized by the cotransport of Na(+) with solute. SGLT1 is responsible for intestinal glucose absorption. Until recently the only role described for SGLT proteins was to transport sugar with Na(+). However, human SGLT3 (hSGLT3) does not transport sugar but causes depolarization of the plasma membrane when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. For this reason SGLT3 was suggested to be a sugar sensor rather than a transporter. Despite 70% amino acid identity between hSGLT3 and hSGLT1, their sugar transport, apparent sugar affinities, and sugar specificity differ greatly. Residue 457 is important for the function of SGLT1 and mutation at this position in hSGLT1 causes glucose-galactose malabsorption. Moreover, the crystal structure of vibrio SGLT\nanimals sensed glucose in an hSGLT3-dependent manner.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In summary, we demonstrate that hSGLT3 functions as a sugar sensor in vivo and that mutating a single amino acid converts this sugar sensor into a sugar transporter similar to SGLT1.\nInterestingly, double mutant analysis indicated that in high Glc, gig is epistatic to both hexokinase1 (hxk1) and aba insensitive4 (abi4), major regulators in sugar and retrograde signaling. Under high-Glc conditions, the addition of Cu had no effect on the recovery of gig/paa1 to the wild type, whereas exogenous Cu feeding could suppress its phenotype under normal growth conditions. The expression of GIG/PAA1 was also altered by mutations in the nuclear factors HXK1, ABI3, and ABI4 in high Glc. Furthermore, a transient expression assay revealed the interaction between ABI4 and the GIG/PAA1 promoter, suggesting that ABI4 actively regulates the transcription of GIG/PAA1, likely binding to the CCAC/ACGT core element of the GIG/PAA1 promoter. Our findings indicate that the plastidial Cu transporter PAA1, which is essential for plastid function and/or activity, plays an important role in bidirectional communication between the plastid and the nucleus in high Glc. A single amino acid change\nAnalysis of Arabidopsis glucose insensitive growth mutants reveals the involvement of the plastidial copper transporter PAA1 in glucose-induced intracellular signaling. Sugars play important roles in many aspects of plant growth and development, acting as both energy sources and signaling molecules. With the successful use of genetic approaches, the molecular components involved in sugar signaling have been identified and their regulatory roles in the pathways have been elucidated. Here, we describe novel mutants of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), named glucose insensitive growth (gig), identified by their insensitivity to high-glucose (Glc)-induced growth inhibition. The gig mutant displayed retarded growth under normal growth conditions and also showed alterations in the expression of Glc-responsive genes under high-Glc conditions. Our molecular identification reveals that GIG encodes the plastidial copper (Cu) transporter PAA1 (for P(1B)-type ATPase 1). Interestingly, double mutant analysis indicated that in high Glc, gig is epistatic to both hexokinase1 (hxk1) and aba insensitive4 (abi4),\nfunction of SGLT1 and mutation at this position in hSGLT1 causes glucose-galactose malabsorption. Moreover, the crystal structure of vibrio SGLT reveals that the residue corresponding to 457 interacts directly with the sugar molecule. We thus wondered if this residue could account for some of the functional differences between SGLT1 and SGLT3.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We mutated the glutamate at position 457 in hSGLT3 to glutamine, the amino acid present in all SGLT1 proteins, and characterized the mutant. Surprisingly, we found that E457Q-hSGLT3 transported sugar, had the same stoichiometry as SGLT1, and that the sugar specificity and apparent affinities for most sugars were similar to hSGLT1. We also show that SGLT3 functions as a sugar sensor in a living organism. We expressed hSGLT3 and E457Q-hSGLT3 in C. elegans sensory neurons and found that animals sensed glucose in an hSGLT3-dependent manner.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In summary, we demonstrate that hSGLT3 functions as a sugar sensor in vivo",

Reverse-transcription was performed with the high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit\nin the HSD17B3 gene are associated with a 46,XY disorder of sexual development (46,XY DSD) as a result of low testosterone production during embryogenesis.AIM: To elucidate the molecular basis of the disorder by chemically analyzing four missense mutations in HSD17B3 (T54A, M164T, L194P, G289S) from Egyptian patients with 46,XY DSD.METHODS: Expression plasmids for wild-type 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid hydrogenase type 3 (17\u03b2-HSD3) and mutant enzymes generated by site-directed mutagenesis were transiently transfected into human HEK-293 cells. Protein expression was verified by western blotting and activity was determined by measuring the conversion of radiolabeled \u03944-androstene-3,17-dione to testosterone. Application of a homology model provided an explanation for the observed effects of the mutations.OUTCOMES: Testosterone formation by wild-type and mutant 17\u03b2-HSD3 enzymes was compared.RESULTS: Mutations T54A and L194P, despite normal protein expression, completely abolished 17\u03b2-HSD3 activity, explaining their severe 46,XY DSD phenotype.

Besides, in pigs, the transformation of pregnenolone in androstenone is also possible. In pigs, a unique gene HSD3B1 encodes for the hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase and CYP17A1 encodes for the cytochrome P450 17\u03b1-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase, these two enzymes being essential. Genes from the cluster of CYP19A (in pigs three genes are suspected,) encode the aromatase enzyme essential for the transformation of androstenedione in estrogens. The transformation of androstenedione in testosterone needs the expression of a gene coding for a 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Usually, the gene HSD17B3 is considered to encode this enzyme, but the AKR1C3 gene would also be involved in humans or HSD17B1 in mice. In pigs, former investigations showed an intense activity of HSD17B3 in testes but not in ovaries. In addition, HSD17B1 appeared inactive in testis, unlike at least two genes from AKR1C cluster/family. A previous\nPCa. The intraovarian actions of estrogen receptor-alpha are necessary to repress the formation of morphological and functional Leydig-like cells in the female gonad. The predisposition of the testis and ovary to primarily synthesize testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2), respectively, is due to gonadal-specific cell types that differentially express the various hydroxysteroid (17beta) dehydrogenase (HSD17B) isoforms. In testes, Leydig cells rely on LH stimulation to maintain expression of the type 3 (HSD17B3) isoform, which specifically converts androstenedione to T. In ovaries, thecal interstitial (TI) cells also rely on LH to induce androgen synthesis but lack HSD17B3 and therefore secrete androgens of low biological activity. Therefore, thecal cells may possess a mechanism to repress the Leydig cell phenotype and HSD17B3 expression. E2 is known to inhibit experimentally Leydig cell function and proliferation. In the current study, we provide evidence that E2 prevents the development of functional Leydig-like cells in the murine ovary\nby GnRH2 and GnRHR2 within porcine testes Production of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone 2 receptor knockdown (GNRHR2 KD) swine line Specificity protein 1: Its role in colorectal cancer progression and metastasis Sp1 and SF-1 interact and cooperate in the regulation of human steroidogenic acute regulatory protein gene expression Cell-specific knockout of steroidogenic factor 1 reveals its essential roles in gonadal function Sp1 regulates steroidogenic genes and LHCGR expression in primary human luteinized granulosa cells Kruppel-like factor 4 plays a role in the luteal transition in steroidogenesis by downregulating Cyp19A1 expression The involvement of the phosphorylatable and nonphosphorylatable transcription factor CREB-1 in the control of human ovarian cell functions Transcription factors SF1 and cJUN cooperate to activate the Fdx1 promoter in MA-10 Leydig cells KLF6 cooperates with NUR77 and SF1 to activate the human INSL3 promoter in mouse MA-10 leydig cells Functional activity of the porcine Gnrhr2 gene promoter in testis-derived cells\nIn the current study, we provide evidence that E2 prevents the development of functional Leydig-like cells in the murine ovary and that this action is mediated by estrogen receptor (ER) alpha. ERalpha-null (alphaERKO) female mice exhibit testis-like levels of Hsd17b3 expression in the ovaries and male-like levels of plasma T. Herein, we demonstrate that: 1) Hsd17b3 expression in alphaERKO ovaries is a primary effect of the loss of intraovarian ERalpha actions; 2) alphaERKO ovarian cells produce substantial levels of T in vitro, and this is blocked by a HSD17B3-specific inhibitor; 3) Hsd17b3 expression in alphaERKO ovaries is LH regulated and localized to the secondary interstitial (SI)/TI cells; and 4) alphaERKO SI/TI cells possess Leydig-like ultrastructural features. These data indicate that intraovarian ERalpha actions are required to repress Hsd17b3 expression in the ovary and may be important to maintaining a female phenotype in SI/TI cells.\nwith CYP11A1 as hub gene, but did not allow the characterization of a robust correlation network around HSD17B3. As the CYP11A1-group includes most of the genes involved in steroid synthesis pathways (including LHCGR encoding for the LH receptor), it may control the synthesis of most of the testicular steroids. The independent expression of HSD17B3 probably allows part of the production of testosterone to escape this control. This CYP11A1-group contained also INSL3 and AGT genes encoding a peptide hormone and an angiotensin peptide precursor, respectively. 1. Introduction The regulation of the synthesis of testicular steroids is of major importance in boars, not only for the control of reproduction but also for the specific problem of boar taint. In mammals, production of sex steroids by Leydig cells is, at least in part, under the endocrine control of both gonadotropins (LH and FSH) and under the paracrine control of testosterone and estradiol. The\nthe HCA performed on mRNAseq-P data, the group of genes clustered with the strongest correlation (see Supplementary Figure S2A) contains SULT2A1, CYP11A1, CYP17A1 and DHRS4 as well as SULT1C1 and RDH12 (Figure 2A). On the HCA performed on mRNAseq-PLW data, a similar group of genes clustered with the strongest correlations is observed. It contains SULT2A1, CYP11A1, CYP17A1, DHRS4, and also STAR, CYP19A as well as eight other genes (Figure 2B, Supplementary Figure S2B). 3.2.2. Identification of Correlation Modules Containing CYP11A1 and HSD17B3 A without a priori approach was used to identify groups of correlated genes from the two transcriptomic datasets. Our purpose was to identify groups of genes linked by weak correlation distance (i.e., identify networks of co-expressed genes) and containing CYP11A1 and other genes involved in steroid synthesis. A weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was performed on the two datasets of mRNAseq after filtration, and 17,170 genes were analyzed.\nhas wider implications. This difference probably explains the absence of the latter gene in the group of the ten correlated genes. However, in testes, the enzyme coded by HSD17B3 is involved in a unique reaction: The transformation of androstenedione in testosterone (see Appendix A). For all animals selected in this study, levels of testosterone and 17\u03b2-estradiol (Supplementary Table S1) were much lower than those observed in mature animals (unpublished data). In this study, pigs were at an early stage of puberty. Using RT-qPCR, we observed a high (significant) correlation between the transcriptional activities of seven genes with the plasmatic level of 17-\u03b2-estradiol. In contrast, no significant correlation was observed between the testosterone plasmatic levels and gene expression. Plasmatic level of testosterone is known to be subject to variations: hours of the day, stress of the animal, etc.. This may explain the absence of significant correlation with gene expression. The testicular\nof the CYP11A1-group were searched using the knowledge about the corresponding gene sequences and TF. From the 85 genes (Figure 8), 82 orthologous human genes were selected for this analysis. The main network identified by this analysis integrated 19 genes having multiple interactions with 18 TFs. The main TF hubs were SP1 (Specificity Protein 1) and NR5A1, which were connected to eight and five genes of the CYP11A1-group respectively. The main hub genes were CYP19A1, STAR, CYP17A1, AGT and CYP11A1, which were connected to nine, six, six, five, and five TFs respectively. The core of this network seemed to be constituted of four genes (CYP19A1, STAR, CYP11A1 and CYP17A1) and three TFs (SP1, NR5A1 and CREB1) (Figure 8). When we included HSD17B3, NCALM and CDH2 in the input group of genes, no modification was observed. 3.6. GNRHR2\u2014Preliminary Results on Mature Testis A low transcriptional activity of GNRHR2 was detected in\nthe day, stress of the animal, etc.. This may explain the absence of significant correlation with gene expression. The testicular production of testosterone must be able to respond to physiological demands. Besides, the results presented here are corroborated by the fact that 17-\u03b2-estradiol is a much better indicator of the pubertal stage of development than testosterone. A hierarchical clustering revealed the important role in the testicular transcriptome of a group of genes containing both CYP11A1 and CYP17A1. To define this group, a complete analysis of all correlations between the levels of transcripts was performed. WGCNA was chosen because of its potential to unravel the gene regulatory architecture of complex traits. This tool proposes to cluster genes into modules based on their co-expression across a set of samples. The two batches of mRNA-seq were analyzed in parallel to characterize modules of co-expression genes containing either CYP11A1 or HSD17B3. In the WGCNA-CYP11A1\ninvolved in the testicular steroidogenesis or its regulation, we suggest that this group controls the major metabolic pathways leading to the synthesis of most of the testicular steroids. We emphasize that that the gene coding for the LH receptor is included in this group. We suggest that the presence of HSD17B3 outside this group probably ensures that, at least, part of the testosterone production escapes this control. The porcine AKR1C4, which is in the CYP11A1-group, appears to be the best candidate gene for encoding a second active 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in the porcine testis. This study provides new arguments to support the involvement of SRD5A1, CYB5R3 and SULT1C1 rather than SRD5A2, CYB5R1 and SULT1E1, respectively, in metabolic pathways related to testicular steroid production in pig.

Supplementary Materials The following are available online at , Figures\nfour AKR1C genes associated with an AKR1E2 gene is expected in the porcine genome. Porcine AKR1C genes are not orthologous to human AKR1C and an identical name does not mean that this gene is involved in the same reactions (details in Supplementary Table S2). To perform a reliable quantification by RT-qPCR, we took into account the high similarities between AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 (AKR1C-pig1 and AKR1C-pig3) to propose only one evaluation for these two AKR1C transcripts. The reference genome assembly Sscrofa11.1 contains only one gene referenced by Ensembl as AKR1C2 but a blast demonstrates that it is AKR1C4 (AKR1C-pig6). Here again the RSEM quantification only evaluates the quantity of all transcripts from the four AKR1C genes. Nevertheless, these transcripts could be involved in distinct pathways. In the human and mouse genomes, a cluster of two or three genes SULT1C and two pseudogenes are found. The reference genome assembly Sscrofa11.1 contains one",

Indeed, these subunits regulate the trafficking of the sodium channel complex at the plasma membrane and simultaneously tune the voltage-dependent properties of the pore-forming alpha-subunit. It is now known that VGSC \u03b2-subunits are capable of similar modulation of multiple isoforms of related voltage-gated potassium channels, suggesting that their abilities extend into the broader voltage-gated channels. The gene family for these single transmembrane immunoglobulin beta-fold proteins extends well beyond the traditional VGSC \u03b21-\u03b24 subunit designation, with deep roots into the cell adhesion protein family and myelin-related proteins - where inherited mutations result in a myriad of electrical signaling disorders. Yet, very little is known about how VGSC \u03b2-subunits support protein trafficking pathways, the basis for their modulation of voltage-dependent gating, and, ultimately, their role in shaping neuronal excitability.

The absence of \u03b2 subunit-like genes in sequenced Ciona genomes does not preclude the presence of numerous other genes with V-type and other IG-like domains ( and unpublished observations). These findings strongly suggest that sodium channel \u03b2 subunit genes are an innovation of vertebrates. As predicted, searches of the genome of the echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (sea urchin), a non-chordate deuterostome, also did not reveal any sodium channel \u03b2 subunits genes. Despite the lack of evidence for \u03b2 subunits genes outside of vertebrates, studies conducted in Drosophila melanogaster demonstrate that invertebrate sodium channels require additional subunits for normal function. Mutations in the Drosophila tip-E (temperature-induced paralysis) gene, which encodes a\nof functional interaction. 5. Co-expression in Xenopus oocytes revealed that beta3 could modify the properties of Nav1.3; beta3 changed the equilibrium of Nav1.3 between the fast and slow gating modes and caused a negative shift in the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation. 6. In conclusion, beta3 is shown to be the predominant beta subunit expressed during development and is capable of modulating the kinetic properties of the embryonic Nav1.3 subunit. These findings provide new information regarding the nature and properties of voltage-gated sodium channels during development. SCN3A-related neurodevelopmental disorder: A spectrum of epilepsy and brain malformation Objective: Pathogenic variants in SCN3A, encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel subunit Nav1.3, cause severe childhood-onset epilepsy and malformation of cortical development. Here, we define the spectrum of clinical, genetic, and neuroimaging features of SCN3A-related neurodevelopmental disorder. Methods: Patients were ascertained via an international collaborative network. We compared sodium channels containing wild-type vs. variant\nthe novel voltage-gated sodium channel auxiliary subunit beta3, in rat CNS. 1. We have compared the mRNA distribution of sodium channel alpha subunits known to be expressed during development with the known auxiliary subunits Nabeta1.1 and Nabeta2.1 and the novel, recently cloned subunit, beta3. 2. In situ hybridisation studies demonstrated high levels of Nav1.2, Nav1.3, Nav1.6 and beta3 mRNA at embryonic stages whilst Nabeta1.1 and Nabeta2.1 mRNA was absent throughout this period. 3. Nabeta1.1 and Nabeta2.1 expression occurred after postnatal day 3 (P3), increasing steadily in most brain regions until adulthood. beta3 expression differentially decreased after P3 in certain areas but remained high in the hippocampus and striatum. 4. Emulsion-dipped slides showed co-localisation of beta3 with Nav1.3 mRNA in areas of the CNS suggesting that these subunits may be capable of functional interaction. 5. Co-expression in Xenopus oocytes revealed that beta3 could modify the properties of Nav1.3; beta3 changed the",

        "desc": "Identification and functional characterization of a novel, tissue-specific NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase beta subunit isoform. To understand the interactions and functional role of each of the three mitochondrial NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma), we have characterized human cDNAs encoding two beta isoforms (beta(1) and beta(2)) and the gamma subunit. Analysis of deduced amino acid sequences revealed that beta(1) and beta(2) encode 349 and 354 amino acids, respectively, and the two isoforms only differ in the most carboxyl 28 amino acids. The gamma cDNA encodes 354 amino acids and is almost identical to monkey IDHgamma. Northern analyses revealed that the smaller beta(2) transcript (1.3 kilobases) is primarily expressed in heart and skeletal muscle, whereas the larger beta(1) mRNA (1.6 kilobases) is prevalent in nonmuscle tissues. Sequence analysis of the IDHbeta gene indicates that the difference in the C-terminal 28 amino acids between beta(1) and beta(2) proteins results from\ncompared to WT and S2814A, consistent with MS findings. Conclusion: By applying state-of-the-art proteomic approaches, we discovered a number of novel RyR2 interactors in the mouse heart. In addition, we found and defined specific alterations in the RyR2 interactome that were dependent on the phosphorylation status of RyR2 at S2814. These findings yield mechanistic insights into RyR2 regulation which may guide future drug designs. Subunit location and sequences of the cysteinyl peptides of pig heart NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. Pig heart NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase has a subunit structure consisting of alpha 2 beta gamma, with the alpha subunit exhibiting a molecular weight of 39,000 and the beta and gamma each having molecular weights of 41,000. The amino-terminal sequences (33-35 residues) and the cysteinyl peptide sequences have now been determined by using subunits separated by chromatofocusing or isoelectric focusing and electroblotting. Displacement of the N-terminal sequence of the alpha subunit by 11-12\nsubunits separated by chromatofocusing or isoelectric focusing and electroblotting. Displacement of the N-terminal sequence of the alpha subunit by 11-12 amino acids relative to that of the larger beta and gamma subunits reveals a 17 amino acid region of great similarity in which 10 residues are identical in all three subunits. The complete enzyme has 6.0 free SH groups per average subunit of 40,000 daltons, but yields 15 distinguishable cysteines in isolated tryptic peptides. Six distinct cysteines in sequenced peptides have been located in the alpha subunit. The beta and gamma subunits contain seven and five cysteines, respectively, with tryptic peptides containing three cysteines being common to the beta and gamma subunits. The three subunits appear to be closely related, but beta and gamma are more similar to each other than either is to the alpha subunit. The NAD-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase from pig heart has been shown to have 2\nthan either is to the alpha subunit. The NAD-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase from pig heart has been shown to have 2 binding sites/enzyme tetramer for isocitrate, manganous ion, NAD+, and the allosteric activator ADP [Colman, R. F. (1983) Pept. Protein Rev. 1, 41-69]. It is proposed that the catalytically active tetrameric enzyme is organized as a dimer of dimers in which the alpha beta and alpha gamma dimers are nonidentical but functionally similar.\npH 7.6) mitochondria. Experiments with a specially designed splicing reporter construct stably transfected into HT1080 cells indicate that acidic conditions favor a splicing pattern responsible for the muscle- and heart-specific beta(2) isoform. Taken together, these data indicate a regulatory role of IDHbeta isoforms in determining the pH optimum for IDH activity through the tissue-specific alternative splicing. An unassembled subunit of NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase is insoluble and covalently modified. The NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an octamer composed of four Idh1p subunits and four Idh2p subunits. Isocitrate dehydrogenase functions in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and has also been reported to bind to the 5' nontranslated region of mitochondrially encoded mRNAs. Mutants defective in either or both of these subunits are unable to grow on the nonfermentable carbon source, acetate, but will utilize glycerol or ethanol. Mutant strains lacking Idh2p maintain normal if not elevated levels of mitochondrial Idh1p.

Evaluation using affinity labeling. NAD-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase from pig heart is composed of three dissimilar subunits present in the native enzyme as 2 alpha:1 beta: 1 gamma, with a tetramer being the smallest form of complete enzyme. The role of these subunits has been explored using affinity labeling. Specifically labeled subunits are separated and then recombined with unmodified subunits to form dimers. Recombination of beta or gamma subunits modified by the isocitrate analogues, 3-bromo-2-ketoglutarate and 3,4-didehydro-2-ketoglutarate, with unmodified alpha subunit led to the same activity in the dimer as\nnovel, tissue-specific NAD + -dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase beta subunit isoform Angiogenic activity of pyruvic acid in in vivo and in vitro angiogenesis models The ubiquitin-proteasome system meets angiogenesis Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of cDNAs encoding the alpha-subunit of human electron transfer flavoprotein The human prohibitin (PHB) gene family and its somatic mutations in human cancers Mammalian prohibitin proteins respond to mitochondrial stress and decrease during cellular senescence A delayed-early response nuclear gene encoding MRPL12, the mitochondrial homologue to the bacterial translational regulator L7/L12 protein hNOA1 interacts with complex I and DAP3 and regulates mitochondrial respiration and apoptosis Subcellular localization of human voltage-dependent anion channel isoforms Cloning and functional expression in yeast of two human isoforms of the outer mitochondrial membrane channel, the voltage-dependent anion channel Human calumenin localizes to the secretory pathway and is secreted to the medium One-step subcellular fractionation of rat liver tissue using a Nycodenz gradient\nsystem involvement. Mammalian isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 3 is a heterotetramer of 2alfa, 1beta, and 1gamma subunits, and IDH3A encodes the alfa subunit of the mitochondrial NAD+-dependent IDH. Here we show that in contrast to wild-type human IDH3A, the human IDH3A which harbor the p.Pro304His mutation does not complement the yeast \u0394idh1/\u0394idh2 growth defect on ethanol-acetate. We therefore propose that homozygosity for the p.Pro304His mutation is deleterious for mitochondrial NAD+-specific IDH3A activity in human. IDH3A now joins the list of TCA cycle-related proteins, which includes ACO2, DLD, SLC25A19, FH, and succinate dehydrogenase subunits, all associated with neurological disorders. Molecular basis for the function of the \u03b1\u03b2 heterodimer of human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. Mammalian mitochondrial NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD-IDH) catalyzes the decarboxylation of isocitrate into \u03b1-ketoglutarate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. It exists as the \u03b12\u03b2\u03b3 heterotetramer composed of the \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b1\u03b3 heterodimers. Different from the \u03b1\u03b3 heterodimer that can be\noperates with a limited mitochondrial reserve capacity and we suggest that this, in combination with the reduced reserve capacity in mutants, explains the degenerative phenotype observed in Idh3a mutant mice.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper. Subunit interactions of yeast NAD+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase. Yeast mitochondrial NAD(+)-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase is an octamer composed of four each of two nonidentical but related subunits designated IDH1 and IDH2. IDH2 was previously shown to contain the catalytic site, whereas IDH1 contributes regulatory properties including cooperativity with respect to isocitrate and allosteric activation by AMP. In this study, interactions between IDH1 and IDH2 were detected using the yeast two-hybrid system, but interactions between identical subunit polypeptides were not detected with this or other methods. A model for heterodimeric interactions between the subunits is therefore proposed for this enzyme. A corollary of this model, based on the three-dimensional\n\u03b3 subunit not the \u03b2 subunit. These results demonstrate that the \u03b3 subunit plays regulatory role to activate the holoenzyme, and the \u03b2 subunit the structural role to facilitate the assembly of the holoenzyme. Kinetic analysis of NAD(+)-isocitrate dehydrogenase with altered isocitrate binding sites: contribution of IDH1 and IDH2 subunits to regulation and catalysis. NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an allosterically regulated enzyme that exists as an octamer composed of two nonidentical subunits, designated IDH1 and IDH2. To determine the contribution of each subunit to regulation and catalysis, a conserved serine residue at the proposed active site of each subunit was mutated to alanine. This mutation in IDH1 resulted in a 6-fold decrease in Vmax and a decrease in cooperativity, but little change in S0.5 for isocitrate. The mutant IDH2, in contrast, exhibited a 60-fold decrease in maximal velocity and a 2-fold reduction in S0.5 for isocitrate, but\nfrom pig heart. The three dissimilar subunits of pig heart DPN-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, which normally occur in the ratio 2 alpha:1 beta:1 gamma, have been separated by chromatofocusing. The subunits were first dissociated from native enzyme (specific activity, 15-20 units/mg) with minimal unfolding in 2 M urea and chromatofocused in the range pH 8-5 in the presence of 1 M urea. Isolated alpha, beta, and gamma subunits had specific activities of 0.4, 0.04, and less than 0.01 unit/mg, respectively, suggesting that at least 3 of the 4 subunits of the alpha 2 beta gamma tetramer contain elements of the catalytic site. Addition of pairs of subunits to assay mixtures resulted in markedly enhanced activity for alpha plus gamma (specific activity, 7.8 units/mg) and alpha plus beta (2.9 units/mg), but not for beta plus gamma. The subunit concentration dependence of enhanced activity indicated formation of stoichiometric alpha beta and alpha gamma\ncolorectal carcinoma MnSOD protects colorectal cancer cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis by inhibition of Smac/DIABLO release Deregulation of manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) expression and lymph node metastasis in tongue squamous cell carcinoma Increased activity of superoxide dismutase in advanced staged of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with locoregional metastases Enoyl coenzyme A hydratase 1 is an important factor in the lymphatic metastasis of tumors Suppression of the invasion and migration of cancer cells by SERPINB family genes and their derived peptides Nuclear localization of maspin is essential for its inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis HIF-1 regulate cytochrome oxidase subunits to optimize efficiency of respiration in hypoxic cells Overexpression of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A2 enhances cell motility and promotes tumor metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma Identification and functional characterization of a novel, tissue-specific NAD + -dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase beta subunit isoform Angiogenic activity of pyruvic acid in in vivo and in\nby the isocitrate analogues, 3-bromo-2-ketoglutarate and 3,4-didehydro-2-ketoglutarate, with unmodified alpha subunit led to the same activity in the dimer as when unmodified beta or gamma was combined with alpha. Contrastingly, modification of alpha with these isocitrate analogues led to loss in activity either alone or when recombined with beta or gamma. Hence, the isocitrate site on alpha is required for catalytic activity but the isocitrate sites on beta or gamma are not necessary for the activity of the functional dimer. Reaction of isolated subunits with 3-bromo-2-ketoglutarate shows that alpha and the alpha beta dimer are modified at about the same rate as holoenzyme, suggestive of similarity of the isocitrate site in native enzyme and in isolated active entities containing alpha subunit; in contrast, beta and gamma subunits react more slowly. Modification by the 2',3'-dialdehyde derivative of the allosteric effector, ADP, led to loss of activity in reconstituted dimers, independent of\nthe relationship between proteins and tumor metastasis is, at least partially, clear.

PRDX6 increased about 2.5-fold in mitochondria of metastatic 5-8F cells than in mitochondria of nonmetastatic 6-10B cells. This result was consistent with the results of other research groups: PRDX6 expressions were increased in node-positive breast carcinoma samples compared with node-negative breast carcinoma\nfor the gamma-isopropyl moiety of IPM. A glutamic acid in domain 1, Glu88, participates in the formation of the hydrophobic pocket. The C beta and C gamma atoms of Glu88 interact with the gamma-isopropyl moiety of IPM and are central to the recognition of substrate. The acidic tip of Glu88 is likely to interact with the nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) ribose of NAD+ in the ternary complex. This structure clearly explains the substrate specificity of IPMDH. The \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits play distinct functional roles in the \u03b12\u03b2\u03b3 heterotetramer of human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. Human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase existing as the \u03b12\u03b2\u03b3 heterotetramer, catalyzes the decarboxylation of isocitrate into \u03b1-ketoglutarate in the Krebs cycle, and is allosterically regulated by citrate, ADP and ATP. To explore the functional roles of the regulatory \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits, we systematically characterized the enzymatic properties of the holoenzyme and the composing \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b1\u03b3 heterodimers\nbut will utilize glycerol or ethanol. Mutant strains lacking Idh2p maintain normal if not elevated levels of mitochondrial Idh1p. In addition to the mature unassembled Idh1p subunit, a complex of bands in the 85- to 170-kDa range (Idh1p-Cpx) is observed using NAD-IDH antiserum. Both Idh1p and Idh1p-Cpx are insoluble within the mitochondrion and are associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane. A histidine-tagged form of Idh1p was expressed in yeast strains. Chemical amounts of the Idh1p-Cpx could be purified from strains lacking Idh2p but not from strains containing normal levels of Idh2p. The data indicate that Idh1p-Cpx is an aggregated and cross-linked form of Idh1p that may be oxidized within the mitochondrion as a consequence of its aborted assembly.

The subunit concentration dependence of enhanced activity indicated formation of stoichiometric alpha beta and alpha gamma complexes. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments revealed that alpha, as isolated, exists primarily as a dimer, while beta and gamma are monomeric. The combinations of alpha and beta and alpha and gamma are dimers. Under the conditions used, no larger complexes were formed when all 3 subunits were added in the ratio (2 alpha:1 beta:1 gamma) found in native enzyme and these mixtures failed to show increased activity above that found with alpha beta and alpha gamma. Native enzyme exhibits a reduced Km for the substrate, isocitrate, in the presence of ADP, but this allosteric effect was not observed for the isolated subunits or for combinations of alpha with beta or gamma. However, ADP binding to isolated alpha and beta subunits as well as to alpha beta and alpha gamma dimers was\nModification by the 2',3'-dialdehyde derivative of the allosteric effector, ADP, led to loss of activity in reconstituted dimers, independent of which subunit was modified. Reaction of isolated subunits with the dialdehyde derivative of ADP is slow compared to the initial reaction with native enzyme, indicating differences in the effects of ADP on intact enzyme and subunits. The ADP sites on all subunits may thus be important in intersubunit interactions, which in turn modulate catalytic activity. Homozygous mutation, p.Pro304His, in IDH3A, encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase subunit is associated with severe encephalopathy in infancy. Mitochondrial encephalopathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders which generally carries a grave prognosis. Using exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous mutation, Pro-304-His in the IDH3A gene, in a patient suffering from infantile encephalopathy with peripheral and autonomic nervous system involvement. Mammalian isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 3 is a heterotetramer of 2alfa, 1beta, and 1gamma subunits, and IDH3A encodes the\nsolely IDH1 or IDH2 contained no detectable activity in the presence or absence of AMP. Gel filtration of these extracts showed that both IDH1 and IDH2 behaved as monomers, suggesting that the major subunit interactions within the octamer are between IDH1 and IDH2. Mouse Idh3a mutations cause retinal degeneration and reduced mitochondrial function. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is an enzyme required for the production of \u03b1-ketoglutarate from isocitrate. IDH3 generates the NADH used in the mitochondria for ATP production, and is a tetramer made up of two \u03b1, one \u03b2 and one \u03b3 subunit. Loss-of-function and missense mutations in both IDH3A and IDH3B have previously been implicated in families exhibiting retinal degeneration. Using mouse models, we investigated the role of IDH3 in retinal disease and mitochondrial function. We identified mice with late-onset retinal degeneration in a screen of ageing mice carrying an ENU-induced mutation, E229K, in Idh3a Mice homozygous for this",

Biochemical studies show that CLIC4 behaves mainly as a soluble cytosolic protein and can associate with proteins of the microtubule cytoskeleton. The localization of CLIC4 to the cortical actin cytoskeleton and its association with AKAP350 at the centrosome and midbody suggests that CLIC4 may be important for regulating cytoskeletal organization during the cell cycle. These findings lead to the conclusion that CLIC4 and possibly other CLIC proteins have alternate cellular functions that are distinct from their proposed roles as chloride channels. Disruption of ER ion homeostasis maintained by an ER anion channel CLCC1 contributes to ALS-like pathologies. Although anion channel activities have been demonstrated in sarcoplasmic reticulum/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER), their molecular identities and functions remain unclear. Here, we link rare variants of Chloride Channel CLIC Like 1 (CLCC1) to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-like\nfunctions remain unclear. Here, we link rare variants of Chloride Channel CLIC Like 1 (CLCC1) to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-like pathologies. We demonstrate that CLCC1 is a pore-forming component of an ER anion channel and that ALS-associated mutations impair channel conductance. CLCC1 forms homomultimers and its channel activity is inhibited by luminal Ca2+ but facilitated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). We identified conserved residues D25 and D181 in CLCC1 N-terminus responsible for Ca2+ binding and luminal Ca2+-mediated inhibition on channel open probability and K298 in CLCC1 intraluminal loop as the critical PIP2-sensing residue. CLCC1 maintains steady-state [Cl-]ER and [K+]ER and ER morphology and regulates ER Ca2+ homeostasis, including internal Ca2+ release and steady-state [Ca2+]ER. ALS-associated mutant forms of CLCC1 increase steady-state [Cl-]ER and impair ER Ca2+ homeostasis, and animals with the ALS-associated mutations are sensitized to stress challenge-induced protein misfolding. Phenotypic comparisons of multiple Clcc1 loss-of-function alleles, including ALS-associated mutations, reveal\nof hepatocytes, where it mediates the uptake of conjugated bile acids and forms the hepatocyte entry receptor for the hepatitis B and D virus. Here, we aimed to identify novel protein-protein interactions that could play a role in the regulation of NTCP. To this end, NTCP was precipitated from HA-tagged hNTCP-expressing HepG2 cells, and chloride channel CLIC-like 1 (CLCC1) and stomatin were identified as interacting proteins by mass spectrometry. Interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. NTCP, CLCC1 and stomatin were found at the plasma membrane in lipid rafts, as demonstrated by a combination of immunofluorescence, cell surface biotinylation and isolation of detergent-resistant membranes. Neither CLCC1 overexpression nor its knockdown had an effect on NTCP function. However, both stomatin overexpression and knockdown increased NTCP-mediated taurocholate uptake while NTCP abundance at the plasma membrane was only increased in stomatin depleted cells. These findings identify stomatin as an interactor of NTCP and show that\nchloride intracellular channel (CLIC) protein family whose principal cellular functions are poorly understood. Recently, we demonstrated that several CLIC proteins, including CLIC4, interact with AKAP350. AKAP350 is concentrated at the Golgi apparatus, centrosome, and midbody and acts as a scaffolding protein for several protein kinases and phosphatases. In this report, we show that endogenous CLIC4 and AKAP350 colocalize at the centrosome and midbody of cultured cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. Unlike AKAP350, CLIC4 is not enriched in the Golgi apparatus but is enriched in mitochondria, actin-based structures at the cell cortex, and the nuclear matrix, indicating that CLIC4-AKAP350 interactions are regulated at specific subcellular sites in vivo. In addition to the centrosome and midbody, CLIC4 colocalizes with AKAP350 and the tight junction protein ZO-1 in the apical region of polarized epithelial cells, suggesting that CLIC4 may play a role in maintaining apical-basolateral membrane polarity during mitosis and cytokinesis. Biochemical studies show\nhave also been shown to modulate the magnitude of CLIC1 interaction with sterols and hence their spontaneous membrane insertion. This study also reports the ability of CLIC1 to interact with other naturally existing sterol molecules. General Significance: Like the sterol molecules, CLIC proteins are evolutionarily conserved with almost all vertebrates expressing six CLIC proteins (CLIC1-6), and CLIC-like proteins are also present in invertebrates and have also been reported in plants. This discovery of CLIC1 protein interaction with other natural sterols and the sterol structural requirements for CLIC membrane insertion provide key information to explore the feasibility of exploiting these properties for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes. CLIC4 is enriched at cell-cell junctions and colocalizes with AKAP350 at the centrosome and midbody of cultured mammalian cells. CLIC4 is a member of the chloride intracellular channel (CLIC) protein family whose principal cellular functions are poorly understood. Recently, we demonstrated that several CLIC proteins,\nand increased cell death. The characterization of PIGBOS reveals an undiscovered role for a mitochondrial protein, in this case a microprotein, in the regulation of UPR originating in the ER. This study demonstrates microproteins to be an unappreciated class of genes that are critical for inter-organelle communication, homeostasis, and cell survival. A conserved GXXXG motif in the transmembrane domain of CLIC proteins is essential for their cholesterol-dependant membrane interaction. BACKGROUND: Sterols have been reported to modulate conformation and hence the function of several membrane proteins. One such group is the Chloride Intracellular Ion Channel (CLIC) family of proteins. The CLIC protein family consists of six evolutionarily conserved protein members in vertebrates. These proteins exist as both monomeric soluble proteins and as membrane bound proteins. To date, the structure of their membrane-bound form remains unknown. In addition to several studies indicating cellular redox environment and pH as facilitators of CLIC1 insertion\npeptide C/S mutant Pep4 CLIC4 NLS peptide RMSD root\u2010mean\u2010square\u2010deviation RMSF root\u2010mean\u2010square\u2010fluctuations INTRODUCTION The chloride intracellular channel proteins (CLICs) family is a class of intracellular chloride channels highly conserved within chordates, with six distinct paralogues (CLIC1\u20106) identified in vertebrates. CLICs display differential expression in numerous cell types with certain regulatory factors, such as membrane lipid composition, pH and redox potentials, directing protein subcellular distribution and therefore determining the functionality of the protein. Within this protein family only CLIC1, CLIC3 and CLIC4 appear in the cell nucleus. Due to the tight transport regulation imposed by the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), proteins require an autonomous signal, known as a nuclear localisation sequence (NLS), to interact with cytosolic importins which will allow access through the NPCs. Interestingly, all vertebrate CLICs, with the exception of CLIC3, exhibit a highly conserved putative NLS (Figure 1) that appears as 199\u2010KVVA KKYR \u2010206 in CLIC4 (NLS residues in\nPep4 and hImp\u03b11\u0394IBB (K d \u2248 130 \u03bcM) and the presence of a proton\u2010linked effect. This weak interaction may be due to regions distal from the CLIC NLS needed to stabilise and strengthen hImp\u03b11\u0394IBB binding. Additionally, this NLS may preferentially bind another hImp\u03b1 isoform with different flexibility properties. Structural and CLIC unclear localisation sequence binding differences between mouse Importin \u03b11 (grey) and human Importin \u03b11 (green) show conformational and sequence differences between the two structures. Nonetheless, the major binding pocket of Imp\u03b1 for interacting with cargo NLSs is highly conserved.

CLICs are the dimorphic protein present in both soluble and membrane fractions. As an integral membrane protein, CLICs potentially possess ion channel activity. However, it is not fully clarified what kinds of roles CLICs play in physiological and pathological conditions. In vertebrates, CLICs are classified into six classes: CLIC1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Recently, in silico analyses have revealed that the expression level of CLICs may have prognostic significance in cancer. In this review, we focus on CLIC2, which has received less attention than other CLICs, and discuss its role in the metastasis and invasion of malignant tumor cells. CLIC2 is expressed at higher levels in benign tumors than in malignant ones, most likely preventing tumor cell invasion into surrounding tissues. CLIC2 is also expressed in the\nThermodynamics of protein\u2013ligand interactions: history, presence, and future aspects Entropy in biological binding processes: estimation of translational entropy loss Just add water!

Background: A membrane protein interaction with lipids shows distinct specificity in terms of the sterol structure. The structure of the sterol's polar headgroup, steroidal rings, and aliphatic side chains have all been shown to influence protein membrane interactions, including the initial binding and subsequent oligomerization to form functional channels.

Phenotypic comparisons of multiple Clcc1 loss-of-function alleles, including ALS-associated mutations, reveal a CLCC1 dosage dependence in the severity of disease phenotypes in vivo. Similar to CLCC1 rare variations dominant in ALS, 10% of K298A heterozygous mice developed ALS-like symptoms, pointing to a mechanism of channelopathy dominant-negatively induced by a loss-of-function mutation. Conditional knockout of Clcc1 cell-autonomously causes motor neuron loss and ER stress, misfolded protein accumulation, and characteristic ALS pathologies in the spinal cord. Thus, our findings support that disruption of ER ion homeostasis maintained by CLCC1 contributes to ALS-like pathologies.\nmembrane insertion of the chloride intracellular ion channel protein, CLIC1. However, the manner in which cholesterol interacts with CLIC1 is yet largely unknown. Method: In this study, the CLIC1 interaction with different lipid:sterol monolayers was studied using the Langmuir trough and neutron reflectometry in order to investigate the structural features of cholesterol essential for the spontaneous membrane insertion of the CLIC1 protein. Molecular docking simulations were also performed to study the binding affinities between CLIC1 and the different sterol molecules. Results: This study, for the first time, highlights the vital role of the free sterol 3\u03b2-OH group as an essential structural requirement for the interaction of CLIC1 with cholesterol. Furthermore, the presence of additional hydroxyl groups, methylation of the sterol skeleton, and the structure of the sterol alkyl side chain have also been shown to modulate the magnitude of CLIC1 interaction with sterols and hence their spontaneous membrane insertion.

Coordinated catalysis is achieved when both subunits of the homodimer interact simultaneously with cleavage sites located symmetrically. This requirement confers Holliday junction specificity. Uncoupled catalysis occurs when binding interactions are disturbed. Genetic studies indicate that uncoupling occurs rarely in vivo, and DNA cleavage is therefore restricted to Holliday junctions. We exploited the specificity of RusA to identify the DNA substrates targeted by the RuvAB and RecG branch-migration proteins in vivo. We present evidence that replication restart in UV-irradiated cells relies on the processing of stalled replication forks by RecG helicase and of Holliday junctions by the RuvABC resolvasome, and that RuvAB alone may not promote repair. Movement of the RecG Motor Domain upon DNA Binding Is Required for Efficient Fork Reversal. RecG catalyzes reversal of stalled replication forks in\nthe fork structure must be regressed away from the initial impediment so that repair can occur. Regression is catalyzed by the powerful, monomeric DNA helicase, RecG. During this reaction, the enzyme couples unwinding of fork arms to rewinding of duplex DNA resulting in the formation of a Holliday junction. RecG works against large opposing forces enabling it to clear the fork of bound proteins. Following subsequent processing of the extruded junction, the PriA helicase mediates reloading of the replicative helicase DnaB leading to the resumption of DNA replication. The single-strand binding protein (SSB) plays a key role in mediating PriA and RecG functions at forks. It binds to each enzyme via linker/OB-fold interactions and controls helicase-fork loading sites in a substrate-dependent manner that involves helicase remodeling. Finally, it is displaced by RecG during fork regression. The intimate and dynamic SSB-helicase interactions play key roles in ensuring fork regression and DNA\nfragments induced by \u03b3-irradiation. These results suggested that the QPW residues facilitate the association of DrRecG with DNA junctions, thereby enhancing the DNA repair efficiency of DrRecG. Characterization of the ATPase activity of the Escherichia coli RecG protein reveals that the preferred cofactor is negatively supercoiled DNA. RecG is a member of the superfamily 2 helicase family. Its possible role in vivo is ATP hydrolysis driven regression of stalled replication forks. To gain mechanistic insight into how this is achieved, a coupled spectrophotometric assay was utilized to characterize the ATPase activity of RecG in vitro. The results demonstrate an overwhelming preference for negatively supercoiled DNA ((-)scDNA) as a cofactor for the hydrolysis of ATP. In the presence of (-)scDNA the catalytic efficiency of RecG and the processivity (as revealed through heparin trapping), were higher than on any other cofactor examined. The activity of RecG on (-)scDNA was not due to\nEffects of Conserved Wedge Domain Residues on DNA Binding Activity of Deinococcus radiodurans RecG Helicase. Deinococcus radiodurans is extremely resistant to ionizing radiation and has an exceptional ability to repair DNA damage caused by various DNA-damaging agents. D. radiodurans uses the same DNA-repair strategies as other prokaryotes, but certain proteins involved in the classical DNA repair machinery have characteristics different from their counterparts. RecG helicase, which unwinds a variety of branched DNA molecules, such as Holliday junctions (HJ) and D-loops, plays important roles in DNA repair, recombination, and replication. Primary sequence analysis of RecG from a number of bacterial species revealed that three amino acids (QPW) in the DNA-binding wedge domain (WD) are well-conserved across the Deinococcus RecG proteins. Interactions involving these conserved residues and DNA substrates were predicted in modeled domain structures of D. radiodurans RecG (DrRecG). Compared to the WD of Escherichia coli RecG protein (EcRecG) containing FSA\nhelicase, which may target stalled replication forks to generate a four-stranded (Holliday) junction, thus facilitating repair and/or bypass of the original lesion. To begin to understand how RecG might catalyse regression of fork structures, we have analysed what the catalytically active form of the enzyme may be. We have found that RecG exists as a monomer in solution as measured by gel filtration but when bound to junction DNA the enzyme forms two distinct protein-DNA complexes that contain one and two protein molecules. However, mutant inhibition studies failed to provide any evidence that RecG acts as a multimer in vitro. Additionally, there was no evidence for cooperativity in the junction DNA-stimulated hydrolysis of ATP. These data suggest that RecG functions as a monomer to unwind junction DNA, which supports an 'inchworm' rather than an 'active rolling' mechanism of DNA unwinding. The observed in vivo inhibition of wild-type RecG by mutant\nSIPs. Here, RecG binding to SSB and SSB peptides was measured in vitro and the RecG/SSB interface was identified. The results show that RecG binds directly and specifically to the SSB-Ct, and not the IDL, through an evolutionarily conserved binding site in the RecG helicase domain. Mutations that block RecG binding to SSB sensitize E. coli to DNA damaging agents and induce the SOS DNA-damage response, indicating formation of the RecG/SSB complex is important in vivo. The broader role of the SSB IDL is also investigated. E. coli ssb mutant strains encoding SSB IDL deletion variants lacking all PxxP motifs retain wildtype growth and DNA repair properties, demonstrating that the SSB PxxP motifs are not major contributors to SSB cellular functions. Substrate specificity of RusA resolvase reveals the DNA structures targeted by RuvAB and RecG in vivo. RusA endonuclease cleaves Holliday junctions by introducing paired strand incisions 5' to CC\nexhibited significant, but lower activity on ssDNA. This activity was enhanced by the Escherichia coli stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) protein, which occurs through stabilizing of the binding of RecG to ssDNA. Stabilization is not afforded by the bacteriophage gene 32 protein, indicating a species specific, protein-protein interaction is involved. These results combine to provide significant insight into the manner and timing of the interaction of RecG with DNA at stalled replication forks. Characterisation of the catalytically active form of RecG helicase. Replication of DNA is fraught with difficulty and chromosomes contain many lesions which may block movement of the replicative machinery. However, several mechanisms to overcome such problems are beginning to emerge from studies with Escherichia coli. An important enzyme in one or more of these mechanisms is the RecG helicase, which may target stalled replication forks to generate a four-stranded (Holliday) junction, thus facilitating repair and/or bypass of the\na DNA fork substrate constructed from a crystal structure of RecG bound to a DNA junction together with recent cryo-electron microscopy (EM) structures of chromatin remodelers in complex with dsDNA. We show by mutational analysis that a conserved loop within the translocation in RecG (TRG) motif that was unstructured in the RecG crystal structure is essential for fork reversal and DNA-dependent conformational changes. Together, this work helps provide a more coherent model of fork binding and remodeling by RecG and related eukaryotic enzymes. DNA Helicase-SSB Interactions Critical to the Regression and Restart of Stalled DNA Replication forks in Escherichia coli. In Escherichia coli, DNA replication forks stall on average once per cell cycle. When this occurs, replisome components disengage from the DNA, exposing an intact, or nearly intact fork. Consequently, the fork structure must be regressed away from the initial impediment so that repair can occur. Regression is catalyzed by\n'inchworm' rather than an 'active rolling' mechanism of DNA unwinding. The observed in vivo inhibition of wild-type RecG by mutant forms of the enzyme was attributed to occlusion of the DNA target and correlates with the very low abundance of replication forks within an E.COLI: cell, even during rapid growth. Interaction with the carboxy-terminal tip of SSB is critical for RecG function in E. coli. In Escherichia coli, the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) acts as a genome maintenance organizational hub by interacting with multiple DNA metabolism proteins. Many SSB-interacting proteins (SIPs) form complexes with SSB by docking onto its carboxy-terminal tip (SSB-Ct). An alternative interaction mode in which SIPs bind to PxxP motifs within an intrinsically-disordered linker (IDL) in SSB has been proposed for the RecG DNA helicase and other SIPs. Here, RecG binding to SSB and SSB peptides was measured in vitro and the RecG/SSB interface was identified. The\nwhereas the activity of RecG is preferentially enhanced. Only once the fork has been regressed and the DNA is relaxed can RuvAB bind to a RecG-extruded Holliday junction. RecG interacts directly with SSB: implications for stalled replication fork regression. RecG and RuvAB are proposed to act at stalled DNA replication forks to facilitate replication restart. To define the roles of these proteins in fork regression, we used a combination of assays to determine whether RecG, RuvAB or both are capable of acting at a stalled fork. The results show that RecG binds to the C-terminus of single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) forming a stoichiometric complex of 2 RecG monomers per SSB tetramer. This binding occurs in solution and to SSB protein bound to single stranded DNA (ssDNA). The result of this binding is stabilization of the interaction of RecG with ssDNA. In contrast, RuvAB does not bind to SSB. Side-by-side\nby RecG during fork regression. The intimate and dynamic SSB-helicase interactions play key roles in ensuring fork regression and DNA replication restart. Characterization of the ATPase activity of RecG and RuvAB proteins on model fork structures reveals insight into stalled DNA replication fork repair. RecG and RuvAB are proposed to act at stalled DNA replication forks to facilitate replication restart. To clarify the roles of these proteins in fork regression, we used a coupled spectrophotometric ATPase assay to determine how these helicases act on two groups of model fork substrates: the first group mimics nascent stalled forks, whereas the second mimics regressed fork structures. The results show that RecG is active on the substrates in group 1, whereas these are poor substrates for RuvAB. In addition, in the presence of group 1 forks, the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) enhances the activity of RecG and enables it to compete with excess\nRecG Motor Domain upon DNA Binding Is Required for Efficient Fork Reversal. RecG catalyzes reversal of stalled replication forks in response to replication stress in bacteria. The protein contains a fork recognition (\"wedge\") domain that binds branched DNA and a superfamily II (SF2) ATPase motor that drives translocation on double-stranded (ds)DNA. The mechanism by which the wedge and motor domains collaborate to catalyze fork reversal in RecG and analogous eukaryotic fork remodelers is unknown. Here, we used electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to probe conformational changes between the wedge and ATPase domains in response to fork DNA binding by Thermotoga maritima RecG. Upon binding DNA, the ATPase-C lobe moves away from both the wedge and ATPase-N domains. This conformational change is consistent with a model of RecG fully engaged with a DNA fork substrate constructed from a crystal structure of RecG bound to a DNA junction together with recent cryo-electron\nthis binding is stabilization of the interaction of RecG with ssDNA. In contrast, RuvAB does not bind to SSB. Side-by-side analysis of the catalytic efficiency of the ATPase activity of each enzyme revealed that (-)scDNA and ssDNA are potent stimulators of the ATPase activity of RecG but not for RuvAB, whereas relaxed circular DNA is a poor cofactor for RecG but an excellent one for RuvAB. Collectively, these data suggest that the timing of repair protein access to the DNA at stalled forks is determined by the nature of the DNA available at the fork. We propose that RecG acts first, with RuvAB acting either after RecG or in a separate pathway following protein-independent fork regression.\ngroup 1 forks, the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) enhances the activity of RecG and enables it to compete with excess RuvA. In contrast, SSB inhibits the activity of RuvAB on these substrates. Results also show that the preferred regressed fork substrate for RuvAB is a Holliday junction, not a forked DNA. The active form of the enzyme on the Holliday junction contains a single RuvA tetramer. In contrast, although the enzyme is active on a regressed fork structure, RuvB loading by a single RuvA tetramer is impaired, and full activity requires the cooperative binding of two forked DNA substrate molecules. Collectively, the data support a model where RecG is responsible for stalled DNA replication fork regression. SSB ensures that if the nascent fork has single-stranded DNA character RuvAB is inhibited, whereas the activity of RecG is preferentially enhanced. Only once the fork has been regressed and the DNA is relaxed\nheparin trapping), were higher than on any other cofactor examined. The activity of RecG on (-)scDNA was not due to the presence of single-stranded regions functioning as loading sites for the enzyme as relaxed circular DNA treated with DNA gyrase, resulted in the highest levels of ATPase activity. Relaxation of (-)scDNA by a topoisomerase resulted in a 12-fold decrease in ATPase activity, comparable to that observed on both linear double-stranded (ds)DNA and (+)scDNA. In addition to the elevated activity in the presence of (-)scDNA, RecG also has high activity on model 4Y-substrates (i.e. chicken foot structures). This is due largely to the high apparent affinity of the enzyme for this DNA substrate, which is 46-fold higher than a 2Y-substrate (i.e. a three-way with two single-stranded (ss)DNA arms). Finally, the enzyme exhibited significant, but lower activity on ssDNA. This activity was enhanced by the Escherichia coli stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) protein,\nmodeled domain structures of D. radiodurans RecG (DrRecG). Compared to the WD of Escherichia coli RecG protein (EcRecG) containing FSA amino acids corresponding to QPW in DrRecG, the HJ binding activity of DrRecG-WD was higher than that of EcRecG-WD. Reciprocal substitution of FSA and QPW increased and decreased the HJ binding activity of the mutant WDs, EcRecG-WDQPW, and DrRecG-WDFSA, respectively. Following \u03b3-irradiation treatment, the reduced survival rate of DrRecG mutants (\u0394recG) was fully restored by the expression of DrRecG, but not by that of EcRecG. EcRecGQPW also enhanced \u03b3-radioresistance of \u0394recG, whereas DrRecGFSA did not. \u0394recG cells complemented in trans by DrRecG and EcRecGQPW reconstituted an intact genome within 3 h post-irradiation, as did the wild-type strain, but \u0394recG with EcRecG and DrRecGFSA exhibited a delay in assembly of chromosomal fragments induced by \u03b3-irradiation. These results suggested that the QPW residues facilitate the association of DrRecG with DNA junctions, thereby",

A bioinorganic approach was recently used to identify novel inhibitors based on a maltol zinc-binding group, but accompanying molecular-docking studies failed to explain why one of these inhibitors, AM-6, had approximately 2500-fold selectivity for MMP-3 over MMP-2. A number of studies have suggested that the matrix-metalloproteinase active site is highly flexible, leading some to speculate that differences in active-site flexibility may explain inhibitor selectivity. To extend the bioinorganic approach in a way that accounts for MMP-2 and MMP-3 dynamics, we here investigate the predicted binding modes and energies of AM-6 docked into multiple structures extracted from matrix-metalloproteinase molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings suggest that accounting for protein dynamics is essential for the accurate prediction of binding affinity and selectivity. Additionally, AM-6 and other similar inhibitors likely select for and stabilize only a subpopulation of all matrix-metalloproteinase conformations sampled by the apo protein. Consequently,\nand 697.1 \u00b1 52.1, respectively. Because each 100 LUDI score units corresponds to an IC50 increase of one order of magnitude, our results are in excellent agreement with the three-order-of-magnitude difference obtained experimentally (IC50 values of >50 and 0.019 \u03bcm for MMP-2 and MMP-3, respectively; Table 1). The same agreement with experiment is observed when a similar protocol is applied to AM-2 and AM-5. The average LUDI score of AM-2 bound to MMP-2 and MMP-3 was 413.1 \u00b1 76.3 and 534.6 \u00b1 94.2, respectively. The roughly 100 units difference is in good agreement with the experimentally measured IC50 values of 9.3 and 0.24 \u03bcm, respectively (Table 1). Similarly, the average LUDI score of AM-5 bound to MMP-2 and MMP-3 was 431.3 \u00b1 69.9 and 567.4 \u00b1 84.9, respectively, again comparing well with the experimentally measured IC50 values (0.61 and 0.01 \u03bcm, respectively; Table 1).

The LUDI scores were binned into histograms according to the docked fragment and receptor target. Note that a different scale has been used for AM-6 to facilitate visualization. Determining the binding mode Analysis of the LUDI docking results revealed two possible binding modes: one in which the added fragment fit deeply into the S1\u2032 pocket (Figure 3C) and another in\nacids; and nitrogenous ligands. Despite the design of these potent inhibitors, thus far only one MMP inhibitor has been approved by the FDA: periostat (doxycycline hyclate), used for the treatment of periodontitis. Preclinical studies of other MMP inhibitors have demonstrated severe side effects caused by inadequate selectivity. Rather than targeting only the MMP involved in pathogenesis, these compounds generally inhibit multiple MMPs, some of which are actually protective, as well as other metalloproteinases unrelated to pathology, e.g., ADAMs/adamalysins. Motivated by the urgent need for selective MMP inhibitors, Puerta et al. recently used a bioinorganic approach to identify novel inhibitors based on a maltol (3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4-pyrone) zinc-binding group (ZBG). Rather than directly studying compound binding to an enzymatic active site, these potential ZBGs were screened against [(TpPh,Me)ZnOH] (TpPh,Me = hydrotris(3,5-phenylmethylpyrazolyl)borate), a bioinorganic molecular model that mimics the MMP active site but is more amenable to mechanistic, structural, and spectroscopic studies. Subsequent molecular\nconformational epitopes of endogenous gelatinases. The therapeutic potential of these antibodies has been demonstrated with relevant mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease. Here we propose a general experimental strategy for generating inhibitory antibodies that effectively target the in vivo activity of dysregulated metalloproteinases by mimicking the mechanism employed by TIMPs. A practical approach to docking of zinc metalloproteinase inhibitors. Forty zinc-dependent metalloproteinase/ligand complexes with known crystal structures were re-docked using five docking/scoring approaches (DOCK, FlexX, DrugScore, GOLD, and AutoDock). Correct geometry of the coordination bonds between the ligand's zinc binding group (ZBG) and the catalytic zinc is important for docking accuracy and scoring reliability. More than 75% of docked poses with RMSD less than 2A were found to have appropriate ZBG binding, but for poor ZBG binding, about 95% of poses failed to dock correctly. Elimination of poses with inappropriate zinc binding resulted in better binding energy predictions that were\nof conformations from closed to open. The occasional fully open conformations, as well as many of the intermediate conformations, have S1\u2032 pockets that can accommodate a bound ligand. MMP-3 dynamics, on the other hand, are more binary, with S1\u2032 pockets that are generally either fully open or closed. It is only when the closed MMP-3 conformations are disregarded that the selectivity of all three inhibitors can be correctly predicted, suggesting that the compounds may in fact select for and stabilize accommodating protein conformations in vitro.

ADAMTS-1 is a unique ADAM family protein with respect to the presence of thrombospondin type I motifs and the capacity to bind to the extracellular matrix. Because ADAMTS-1 has a potential zinc-binding motif in the metalloproteinase domain, we examined in this study whether ADAMTS-1 is an active metalloproteinase by means of the proteinase trapping mechanism of alpha2-macroglobulin. We found that the soluble type of ADAMTS-1 protein is able to form a covalent-binding complex with alpha2-macroglobulin. Furthermore, the point mutation within the zinc-binding motif of ADAMTS-1 protein eliminates its capacity to bind to alpha2-macroglobulin. These data demonstrate that the metalloproteinase domain of ADAMTS-1 is catalytically active. In addition, we showed that the removal of the pro-domain from the ADAMTS-1 precursor is impaired in the furin-deficient cell line, LoVo, and\npossible binding modes: one in which the added fragment fit deeply into the S1\u2032 pocket (Figure 3C) and another in which S1\u2032 was not amenable to deep binding (Figure 3B). To distinguish between these two binding modes, for each frame we calculated the distance between a key S1\u2032 carbonyl oxygen atom and the nearest atom of the LUDI-docked fragment. The carbonyl oxygen atoms of leucine 115 and leucine 111 were used for MMP-3 and MMP-2, respectively. If this distance was <5 \u00c5, the fragment was thought to bind deep in the S1\u2032 pocket. Otherwise, binding was considered to be superficial. Three distinct conformations of the matrix-metalloproteinase active site, extracted from an molecular dynamics simulation. Some protein residues have been removed to facilitate visualization. The protein is shown in gray, the active-site zinc cation is shown in ice blue, and the ligand is colored by element. (A) Some protein conformations were\nand cellular storage, sensor, and trafficking proteins. These proteins have evolved with mechanisms to handle zinc ions rather specifically and selectively. They perform their functions with a remarkably modest set: One redox state of the zinc ion and nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur ligands from the side chains of histidine, glutamate/aspartate, and cysteine, respectively. By permutation of the ligands in this set, the functional potential of the zinc ion has been fully explored. Different coordination environments modulate the chemical characteristics of the zinc ion, control the kinetics of its binding, and allow it to be either metabolically active or inert. Insights into all these functions are building an understanding of why zinc is so critical for such a multitude of life processes. ADAMTS-1 is an active metalloproteinase associated with the extracellular matrix. Cellular disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs) are a family of genes with a sequence similar to the snake venom metalloproteinases\nsimilar inhibitors likely select for and stabilize only a subpopulation of all matrix-metalloproteinase conformations sampled by the apo protein. Consequently, when attempting to predict ligand affinity and selectivity using an ensemble of protein structures, it may be wise to disregard protein conformations that cannot accommodate the ligand. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-containing enzymes capable of degrading all components of the extracellular matrix. They are generally grouped into four classes depending on the matrix component degraded: collagenases (MMP-1, MMP-8, MMP-13), gelatinases (MMP-2, MMP-9), stromelysins (MMP-3, MMP-10, MMP-11), and membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMPs). Owing to their role in vascular disease, asthma, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and cancer, MMPs have been the subject of extensive study. To date, several potent inhibitors have been identified, including hydroxamates; thiols; carbamoylphosphonates; hydroxyureas; hydrazines; \u03b2-lactams and squaric acids; and nitrogenous ligands. Despite the design of these potent inhibitors, thus far only one MMP inhibitor has been approved\nmolecular model that mimics the MMP active site but is more amenable to mechanistic, structural, and spectroscopic studies. Subsequent molecular modeling of the enzyme active site revealed that combining this ZBG with an amide linker permits easy access to a hydrophobic, druggable binding pocket (S1\u2032) adjacent to the active-site zinc cation. A computer fragment-docking program was used to predict the MMP-2 and MMP-3 binding affinity of several composite compounds formed by adding small-molecule fragments to the maltol ZBG. X-ray crystallographic data were used to build the receptor models, and fragments were selected based on the earlier work of Hajduk et al.. Experimental study revealed that three of the composite compounds, those formed by adding biphenyl (AM-2), biphenyl cyanide (AM-5), and triphenyl (AM-6) fragments to the ZBG, respectively, were selective for MMP-3 over MMP-2 (Table 1). Although accompanying fragment-docking calculations confirmed AM-2 and AM-5 selectivity for MMP-3 over MMP-2, these theoretical\nactive-site zinc cation is shown in ice blue, and the ligand is colored by element. (A) Some protein conformations were not amenable to fragment addition. (B) Other conformations were amenable to fragment addition but did not allow deep binding to the S1\u2032 subsite. (C) Others were amenable to both fragment addition and deep binding. Results and Discussion The purpose of this study is to extend the bioinorganic approach originally pioneered by Puerta et al. in a way that properly accounts for MMP-2 and MMP-3 dynamics. To understand the molecular basis of the observed MMP-3 selectivity of ZBG + amide linker + AM-6 (Figure 2), we explored the role protein flexibility might play in inhibitor binding for this system. The importance of protein flexibility Numerous studies have demonstrated the important role of protein flexibility in ligand binding. For example, a recent MD simulation of HIV integrase revealed a previously uncharacterized binding\nreviewed, together with their role in the pathogenesis of the local tissue damage characteristic of crotaline and viperine snake envenomations. Venom metalloproteinases differ in their domain structure. Some enzymes comprise only the metalloproteinase domain, others have disintegrin-like and high cysteine domains and others present, besides these domains, an additional lectin-like subunit. All of them are zinc-dependent enzymes with highly similar zinc binding environments. Some metalloproteinases induce hemorrhage by directly affecting mostly capillary blood vessels. It is suggested that hemorrhagic enzymes cleave, in a highly selective fashion, key peptide bonds of basement membrane components, thereby affecting the interaction between basement membrane and endothelial cells. As a consequence, these cells undergo a series of morphological and functional alterations in vivo, probably associated with biophysical hemodynamic factors such as tangential fluid shear stress. Eventually, gaps are formed in endothelial cells through which extravasation occurs. In addition to hemorrhage, venom metalloproteinases induce skeletal muscle\nbecause of the importance of these molecules in envenomation. Batroxase, which is a metalloproteinase isolated from Bothrops atrox (Par\u00e1) snake venom, was obtained by gel filtration and anion exchange chromatography. The enzyme is a single protein chain composed of 202 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 22.9 kDa, as determined by mass spectrometry analysis, showing an isoelectric point of 7.5. The primary sequence analysis indicates that the proteinase contains a zinc ligand motif (HELGHNLGISH) and a sequence C\u2081\u2086\u2084 I\u2081\u2086\u2085M\u2081\u2086\u2086 motif that is associated with a \"Met-turn\" structure. The protein lacks N-glycosylation sites and contains seven half cystine residues, six of which are conserved as pairs to form disulfide bridges. The three-dimensional structure of Batroxase was modeled based on the crystal structure of BmooMP\u03b1-I from Bothrops moojeni. The model revealed that the zinc binding site has a high structural similarity to the binding site of other metalloproteinases. Batroxase presented\nrevealed that the zinc binding site has a high structural similarity to the binding site of other metalloproteinases. Batroxase presented weak hemorrhagic activity, with a MHD of 10 \u03bcg, and was able to hydrolyze extracellular matrix components, such as type IV collagen and fibronectin. The toxin cleaves both \u03b1 and \u03b2-chains of the fibrinogen molecule, and it can be inhibited by EDTA, EGTA and \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. Batroxase was able to dissolve fibrin clots independently of plasminogen activation. These results demonstrate that Batroxase is a zinc-dependent hemorrhagic metalloproteinase with fibrin(ogen)olytic and thrombolytic activity.

Our study provides insights into the mechanism of ligand recognition and G-protein selectivity by TAAR1, which may help in the discovery of ligands or therapeutic strategies for neurological and metabolic disorders. The Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1 Agonist 3-Iodothyronamine Induces Biased Signaling at the Serotonin 1b Receptor. Trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) belong to the class A G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and are evolutionary related to aminergic receptors. TAARs have been identified to mediate effects of trace amines. TAAR1 signaling is mainly mediated via activation of the Gs/adenylyl cyclase pathway. In addition to classical trace amines, TAAR1 can also be activated by the thyroid hormone derivative 3-iodothyronamine (3-T1AM). Pharmacological doses of 3-T1AM induced metabolic and anapyrexic effects, which might be centrally mediated in the hypothalamus in rodents. However, the observed anapyrexic effect of 3-T1AM persists in Taar1 knock-out mice which raises the question whether further GPCRs\nFunctional interaction between trace amine-associated receptor 1 and dopamine D2 receptor. The ability of dopamine receptors to interact with other receptor subtypes may provide mechanisms for modulating dopamine-related functions and behaviors. In particular, there is evidence suggesting that the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) affects the dopaminergic system by regulating the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons or by altering dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) responsiveness to ligands. TAAR1 is a G\u03b1(s) protein-coupled receptor that is activated by biogenic amines, \"trace amines,\" such as \u03b2-phenylethylamine (\u03b2-PEA) and tyramine that are normally found at low concentrations in the mammalian brain. In the present study, we investigated the biochemical mechanism of interaction between TAAR1 and D2R and the role this interaction plays in D2R-related signaling and behaviors. Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer biosensor for cAMP, we demonstrated that the D2R antagonists haloperidol, raclopride, and amisulpride were able to enhance selectively a TAAR1-mediated \u03b2-PEA\nfor cAMP, we demonstrated that the D2R antagonists haloperidol, raclopride, and amisulpride were able to enhance selectively a TAAR1-mediated \u03b2-PEA increase of cAMP. Moreover, TAAR1 and D2R were able to form heterodimers when coexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and this direct interaction was disrupted in the presence of haloperidol. In addition, in mice lacking TAAR1, haloperidol-induced striatal c-Fos expression and catalepsy were significantly reduced. Taken together, these data suggest that TAAR1 and D2R have functional and physical interactions that could be critical for the modulation of the dopaminergic system by TAAR1 in vivo. Ligand recognition and G-protein coupling of trace amine receptor TAAR1. Trace-amine-associated receptors (TAARs), a group of biogenic amine receptors, have essential roles in neurological and metabolic homeostasis1. They recognize diverse endogenous trace amines and subsequently activate a range of G-protein-subtype signalling pathways2,3. Notably, TAAR1 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for treating psychiatric disorders4,5.\naccumulation, but not PLC activation. Co-stimulation of 5-HT1b by both ligands did not lead to additive or synergistic signaling effects. In addition, we confirmed the capacity for heteromerization between TAAR1 and 5-HT1b. Under co-expression of TAAR1 and HTR1b, 3-T1AM action is only mediated via TAAR1 and activation of 5-HT1b is abrogated. In conclusion, we found evidence for 5-HT1b as a new receptor target for 3-T1AM, albeit with a different signaling effect than the endogenous ligand. Altogether, this indicates a complex interrelation of signaling effects between the investigated GPCRs and respective ligands. Trace Amines and the Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1: Pharmacology, Neurochemistry, and Clinical Implications. Biogenic amines are a collection of endogenous molecules that play pivotal roles as neurotransmitters and hormones. In addition to the \"classical\" biogenic amines resulting from decarboxylation of aromatic acids, including dopamine (DA), norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin (5-HT), and histamine, other biogenic amines, present at much lower concentrations\nof aromatic acids, including dopamine (DA), norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin (5-HT), and histamine, other biogenic amines, present at much lower concentrations in the central nervous system (CNS), and hence referred to as \"trace\" amines (TAs), are now recognized to play significant neurophysiological and behavioral functions. At the turn of the century, the discovery of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a phylogenetically conserved G protein-coupled receptor that is responsive to both TAs, such as \u03b2-phenylethylamine, octopamine, and tyramine, and structurally-related amphetamines, unveiled mechanisms of action for TAs other than interference with aminergic pathways, laying the foundations for deciphering the functional significance of TAs and its mammalian CNS receptor, TAAR1. Although, its molecular interactions and downstream targets have not been fully elucidated, TAAR1 activation triggers accumulation of intracellular cAMP, modulates PKA and PKC signaling and interferes with the \u03b2-arrestin2-dependent pathway via G protein-independent mechanisms. TAAR1 is uniquely positioned to exert direct control\nactivate a range of G-protein-subtype signalling pathways2,3. Notably, TAAR1 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for treating psychiatric disorders4,5. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its ability to recognize different ligands remain largely unclear. Here we present nine cryo-electron microscopy structures, with eight showing human and mouse TAAR1 in a complex with an array of ligands, including the endogenous 3-iodothyronamine, two antipsychotic agents, the psychoactive drug amphetamine and two identified catecholamine agonists, and one showing 5-HT1AR in a complex with an antipsychotic agent. These structures reveal a rigid consensus binding motif in TAAR1 that binds to endogenous trace amine stimuli and two extended binding pockets that accommodate diverse chemotypes. Combined with mutational analysis, functional assays and molecular dynamic simulations, we elucidate the structural basis of drug polypharmacology and identify the species-specific differences between human and mouse TAAR1. Our study provides insights into the mechanism of ligand recognition and G-protein selectivity\nrodents. However, the observed anapyrexic effect of 3-T1AM persists in Taar1 knock-out mice which raises the question whether further GPCRs are potential targets for 3-T1AM and mediate the observed physiological effect. Anapyrexia has been observed to be related to action on aminergic receptors such as the serotonin receptor 1b (5-HT1b). This receptor primarily activates the Gi/o mediated pathway and PLC signaling through the G\u03b2\u03b3 of Gi/o. Since the expression profiles of TAAR1 and 5-HT1b overlap, we questioned whether 3-T1AM may activate 5-HT1b. Finally, we also evaluated heteromerization between these two GPCRs and tested signaling under co-expressed conditions. In this study, we showed, that 3-T1AM can induce Gi/o signaling through 5-HT1b in a concentration of 10 \u03bcM. Strikingly, at 5-HT1b the ligand 3-T1AM only activates the Gi/o mediated reduction of cAMP accumulation, but not PLC activation. Co-stimulation of 5-HT1b by both ligands did not lead to additive or synergistic signaling effects.\nPKC signaling and interferes with the \u03b2-arrestin2-dependent pathway via G protein-independent mechanisms. TAAR1 is uniquely positioned to exert direct control over DA and 5-HT neuronal firing and release, which has profound implications for understanding the pathophysiology of, and therefore designing more efficacious therapeutic interventions for, a range of neuropsychiatric disorders that involve aminergic dysregulation, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, mood disorders, and addiction. Indeed, the recent development of novel pharmacological tools targeting TAAR1 has uncovered the remarkable potential of TAAR1-based medications as new generation pharmacotherapies in neuropsychiatry. This review summarizes recent developments in the study of TAs and TAAR1, their intricate neurochemistry and pharmacology, and their relevance for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease.",

The conductance and gating properties of purified recombinant TRIC channels reconstituted into artificial membranes are similar to those of the monovalent cation selective SR K+ channels first observed from preparations of isolated rabbit skeletal SR vesicles (Labarca et al. 1980; Yazawa et al.\nby protein kinase A phosphorylation, demonstrating a defect in the ability of \u03b2\u2010adrenergic stimulation to regulate sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+\u2010release. The defective RyR1 gating that we describe probably contributes significantly to the impaired SR Ca2+\u2010release observed in skeletal muscle from Tric\u2010a KO mice, further highlighting the importance of TRIC\u2010A for normal physiological regulation of SR Ca2+\u2010release in skeletal muscle. Abstract The type A trimeric intracellular cation channel (TRIC\u2010A) is a major component of the nuclear and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes of cardiac and skeletal muscle, and is localized closely with ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels in the SR terminal cisternae. The skeletal muscle of Tric\u2010a knockout (KO) mice is characterized by Ca2+ overloaded and swollen SR and by changes in the properties of SR Ca2+ release. We therefore investigated whether RyR1 gating behaviour is modified in the SR from Tric\u2010a KO mice by incorporating native RyR1 into planar phospholipid bilayers under\nMg2+ in mammalian and amphibian muscle. An RyR isoform\u2010specific role in excitation\u2013contraction coupling? Trimeric intracellular cation channels and sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis The biophysical properties of TRIC-A and TRIC-B and their interactions with RyR2 Hu et al. demonstrate that, independent of other countercurrents, TRIC-A and TRIC-B differentially modulate RyR2 gating. Results also suggest that TRIC-A and TRIC-B are permeable to both K+ and Cl\u2212, thus enabling them to provide adaptable countercurrents for many cell types. Trimeric intracellular cation channels (TRIC-A and TRIC-B) are thought to provide counter-ion currents to enable charge equilibration across the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (SR) and nuclear membranes. However, there is also evidence that TRIC-A may interact directly with ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) and 2 (RyR2) to alter RyR channel gating. It is therefore possible that the reverse is also true, where the presence of RyR channels is necessary for fully functional TRIC channels.

Our results indicate that the physiological roles of TRIC-A and TRIC-B may include direct, complementary regulation of RyR2 gating in addition to the provision of counter-ion currents of both cations and anions. Introduction The trimeric intracellular cation channels (TRIC), of which there are two types, TRIC-A and TRIC-B, are located in sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (SR) and nuclear membranes. Crosslinking studies and electron microscopy indicated that TRICs are a novel type of ion channel that are trimeric in structure. TRIC-B was shown to be expressed at low levels in most cells while TRIC-A was found in high concentrations in cardiac and skeletal muscles and in the brain. This first report of these novel proteins found that the incorporation of purified TRIC-A into artificial\nCa2+-induced conformational change in a cytoplasmic loop above the gate. A mechanistic model has been proposed to account for the complex gating mechanism of TRIC channels. Dampened activity of ryanodine receptor channels in mutant skeletal muscle lacking TRIC\u2010A Key points The role of trimeric intracellular cation (TRIC) channels is not known, although evidence suggests they may regulate ryanodine receptors (RyR) via multiple mechanisms. We therefore investigated whether Tric\u2010a gene knockout (KO) alters the single\u2010channel function of skeletal RyR (RyR1). We find that RyR1 from Tric\u2010a KO mice are more sensitive to inhibition by divalent cations, although they respond normally to cytosolic Ca2+, ATP, caffeine and luminal Ca2+. In the presence of Mg2+, ATP cannot effectively activate RyR1 from Tric\u2010a KO mice. Additionally, RyR1 from Tric\u2010a KO mice are not activated by protein kinase A phosphorylation, demonstrating a defect in the ability of \u03b2\u2010adrenergic stimulation to regulate sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+\u2010release.\nactivity that arise as a result of K+ fluxes across the SR via TRIC\u2010A.

Trimeric intracellular cation channels (TRIC) represents a novel class of trimeric intracellular cation channels. Two TRIC isoforms have been identified in both the human and the mouse genomes: TRIC-A, a subtype predominantly expressed in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of muscle cells, and TRIC-B, a ubiquitous subtype expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of all tissues. Genetic ablation of either TRIC-A or TRIC-B leads to compromised K(+) permeation and Ca(2+) release across the SR/ER membrane, supporting the hypothesis that TRIC channels provide a counter balancing K(+) flux that reduces SR/ER membrane depolarization for maintenance of the electrochemical gradient that drives SR/ER Ca(2+) release. TRIC-A and TRIC-B seem to have differential functions in Ca(2+) signaling in excitable and nonexcitable cells. Tric-a(-/-) mice display defective Ca(2+) sparks and spontaneous transient outward currents in arterial smooth muscle and develop hypertension, in addition to skeletal muscle\nWe find that lone SR K+ -channels from Tric-a KO mice have a lower open probability and gate more frequently in subconducting states than channels from WT mice but, unlike channels from WT mice, multiple channels gate with high open probability with a more than six-fold increase in activity when four channels are present in the bilayer. No evidence was found for a direct gating interaction between ryanodine receptor and SR K+ -channels in Tric-a KO SR, suggesting that TRIC-B-TRIC-B interactions are highly specific and may be important for meeting counterion requirements during excitation-contraction coupling in tissues where TRIC-A is sparse or absent.ABSTRACT: The trimeric intracellular cation channels, TRIC-A and TRIC-B, represent two subtypes of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) K+ -channel but their individual functional roles are unknown. We therefore compared the biophysical properties of SR K+ -channels derived from the skeletal muscle of wild-type (WT) or Tric-a knockout (KO) mice.\noscillations. Upon ER Ca2+ depletion, TRIC-A clusters with stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and Ca2+-release-activated Ca2+ channel 1 (Orai1) within ER-plasma membrane (PM) junctions and impairs assembly of the STIM1/Orai1 complex, causing a decrease in Orai1-mediated Ca2+ current and SOCE. Together, our findings demonstrate that TRIC-A is a negative regulator of STIM1/Orai1 function. Thus, aberrant SOCE could contribute to muscle disorders associated with loss of TRIC-A. Pore architecture of TRIC channels and insights into their gating mechanism. Intracellular Ca2+ signalling processes are fundamental to muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, cell growth and apoptosis. Release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores is supported by a series of ion channels in sarcoplasmic or endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER). Among them, two isoforms of the trimeric intracellular cation (TRIC) channel family, named TRIC-A and TRIC-B, modulate the release of Ca2+ through the ryanodine receptor or inositol triphosphate receptor, and maintain the homeostasis of ions within SR/ER\nchanges in proton concentrations Rapid calcium release from cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles is dependent on Ca2+ and is modulated by Mg2+, adenine nucleotide, and calmodulin A novel ryanodine receptor mutation linked to sudden death increases sensitivity to cytosolic calcium Voltage-gated cation conductance channel from fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum: Steady-state electrical properties A mechanistic description of gating of the human cardiac ryanodine receptor in a regulated minimal environment Regulation of calcium release is gated by calcium current, not gating charge, in cardiac myocytes Primary structure and functional expression from cDNA of the cardiac ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel Ion- and water-binding sites inside an occluded hourglass pore of a trimeric intracellular cation (TRIC) channel Effect of N-bromoacetamide on single sodium channel currents in excised membrane patches Chicken skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor isoforms: Ion channel properties Charade of the SR K+-channel: Two ion-channels, TRIC-A and TRIC-B, masquerade as a single K+-channel Involvement of dihydropyridine\nrescue of TRiC protein levels. Notably, small interference RNA-mediated knockdown of VRK2 enhanced TRiC protein stability and decreased polyQ aggregation. The VRK2-mediated reduction of TRiC protein levels was subsequent to the recruitment of COP1 E3 ligase. Among the members of the COP1 E3 ligase complex, VRK2 interacted with RBX1 and increased E3 ligase activity on TRiC in vitro. Taken together, these results demonstrate that VRK2 is crucial to regulate the ubiquitination-proteosomal degradation of TRiC, which controls folding of polyglutamine proteins involved in Huntington's disease. TRIC channels supporting efficient Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores. Trimeric intracellular cation-selective (TRIC) channel subtypes, namely TRIC-A and TRIC-B, are derived from distinct genes and distributed throughout the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) and nuclear membranes. TRIC-A is preferentially expressed at high levels in excitable tissues, while TRIC-B is ubiquitously detected at relatively low levels in various tissues. TRIC channels are composed of ~300 amino acid residues and\nIP(3)R-mediated Ca(2+) release essential for surfactant handling is impaired in the mutant alveolar epithelial cells. Moreover, double-knockout mice lacking both TRIC subtypes show embryonic heart failure, and SR Ca(2+) handling is deranged in the mutant cardiomyocytes. Current evidence strongly suggests that TRIC channels mediate counter-K(+) movements, in part, to facilitate physiological Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores. Enhanced activity of multiple TRIC-B channels: an endoplasmic reticulum/sarcoplasmic reticulum mechanism to boost counterion currents. KEY POINTS: There are two subtypes of trimeric intracellular cation (TRIC) channels but their distinct single-channel properties and physiological regulation have not been characterized. We examined the differences in function between native skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) K+ -channels from wild-type (WT) mice (where TRIC-A is the principal subtype) and from Tric-a knockout (KO) mice that only express TRIC-B. We find that lone SR K+ -channels from Tric-a KO mice have a lower open probability and gate more frequently\nthe tric-a(-/-) muscle. Our data suggests that absence of TRIC-A may lead to Ca(2+) overload in SR, which in combination with the reduced counter-ion movement may lead to instability of Ca(2+) movement across the SR membrane. The observed alternan behavior with the tric-a(-/-) muscle may reflect a skeletal muscle version of store overload-induced Ca(2+) release that has been reported in the cardiac muscle under stress conditions. Absence of the ER Cation Channel TMEM38B/TRIC-B Disrupts Intracellular Calcium Homeostasis and Dysregulates Collagen Synthesis in Recessive Osteogenesis Imperfecta. Recessive osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is caused by defects in proteins involved in post-translational interactions with type I collagen. Recently, a novel form of moderately severe OI caused by null mutations in TMEM38B was identified. TMEM38B encodes the ER membrane monovalent cation channel, TRIC-B, proposed to counterbalance IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. The molecular mechanisms by which TMEM38B mutations cause OI are unknown. We identified\nfor the channel activity. Furthermore, the kinks of the TM2 and TM5 helices generate lateral fenestrations at each subunit interface. Unexpectedly, these lateral fenestrations are occupied with lipid molecules. This study provides the structural and functional framework for the molecular mechanism of this ion channel superfamily. Ca2+ overload and sarcoplasmic reticulum instability in tric-a null skeletal muscle. The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of skeletal muscle contains K(+), Cl(-), and H(+) channels may facilitate charge neutralization during Ca(2+) release. Our recent studies have identified trimeric intracellular cation (TRIC) channels on SR as an essential counter-ion permeability pathway associated with rapid Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores. Skeletal muscle contains TRIC-A and TRIC-B isoforms as predominant and minor components, respectively. Here we test the physiological function of TRIC-A in skeletal muscle. Biochemical assay revealed abundant expression of TRIC-A relative to the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor with a molar ratio of TRIC-A/ryanodine receptor \u223c5:1. Electron\nand emerin controls were arrayed as synthetic 20-mer peptides (7-residue stagger) and incubated with recombinant purified lamin A \"tail\" residues 385-646 under relatively stringent conditions. We detected strong lamin A binding to peptides solvent exposed in Lmcd1, AldoA, Perm1, and Tmem38a, and plausible binding to Csrp3 (muscle LIM protein). These results validated both proteomes as sources for native lamin A/C-binding proteins in heart and muscle, identified four candidate genes for Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (CSRP3, LMCD1, ALDOA, and PERM1), support a lamin A-interactive molecular role for Tmem38A, and supported the hypothesis that lamin A/C interactions with at least two partners (AldoA in heart, transcription factor Lmcd1 in muscle) are altered in the IL10-KO model of frailty.

An RyR isoform\u2010specific role in excitation\u2013contraction coupling? Trimeric intracellular cation channels and sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum\n2 Ryanodine Receptor in Cardiac Muscle Rationale: TRIC-A and TRIC-B are distributed to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) intracellular Ca2+ stores. The crystal structure of TRIC has been determined, confirming the homo-trimeric structure of a potassium channel. While the pore architectures of TRIC-A and TRIC-B are conserved, the carboxyl-terminal tail domains (CTT) of TRIC-A and TRIC-B are different from each other. Aside from its recognized role as a counter-ion channel that participates in excitation-contraction coupling of striated muscles, the physiological function of TRIC-A in heart physiology and disease has remained largely unexplored. Objective: In cardiomyocytes, spontaneous Ca2+ waves, triggered by store overload-induced Ca2+ release (SOICR) mediated by the type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2), develop extra-systolic contractions often associated with arrhythmic events. Here we test the hypothesis that TRIC-A is a physiologic component of RyR2-mediated Ca2+ release machinery that directly modulates SOICR activity via CTT. Methods and Results: We show that",

Cyclic-di-nucleotide-based secondary messengers regulate various physiological functions, including stress responses in bacteria. Cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) has recently emerged as a crucial second messenger with implications in processes including osmoregulation, antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation, virulence, DNA repair, ion homeostasis, and sporulation, and has potential therapeutic applications. The contrasting activities of the enzymes diadenylate cyclase (DAC) and phosphodiesterase (PDE) determine the equilibrium levels of c-di-AMP. Although c-di-AMP is suspected of playing an essential role in the pathophysiology of bacterial infections and in regulating host-pathogen interactions, the mechanisms of its regulation remain relatively unexplored in mycobacteria.

This is consistent with the observation that DisA interacts with and inhibits RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange rather than RecA inhibits the DAC activity of DisA. We consider unlikely that the order of protein addition affects DisA assembly, because DisA inhibits RecA-mediated ATP hydrolysis and DNA strand exchange rather than stimulates the efficiency of the reaction. DisA-mediated c-di-AMP synthesis is not affected\nabsence of DNA damage/replication stress via normal c-di-AMP levels, while interaction with HJ DNA/halted forks leads to reduced c-di-AMP levels and an ensuing block in cell proliferation. RadA/Sms may be involved in modulating DisA activities. An Essential Poison: Synthesis and Degradation of Cyclic Di-AMP in Bacillus subtilis. UNLABELLED: Gram-positive bacteria synthesize the second messenger cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) to control cell wall and potassium homeostasis and to secure the integrity of their DNA. In the firmicutes, c-di-AMP is essential for growth. The model organism Bacillus subtilis encodes three diadenylate cyclases and two potential phosphodiesterases to produce and degrade c-di-AMP, respectively. Among the three cyclases, CdaA is conserved in nearly all firmicutes, and this enzyme seems to be responsible for the c-di-AMP that is required for cell wall homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that CdaA localizes to the membrane and forms a complex with the regulatory protein CdaR and the glucosamine-6-phosphate mutase GlmM.\nand alter their physiology accordingly through the use of signal transduction pathways involving second messenger nucleotides. One broadly conserved second messenger is cyclic-di-AMP (c-di-AMP) which regulates a range of processes including cell wall homeostasis, potassium uptake, DNA repair, fatty acid synthesis, biofilm formation and central metabolism in bacteria. The intracellular pool of c-di-AMP is maintained by the activities of diadenylate cyclase (DAC) and phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes, as well as possibly via c-di-AMP export. Whilst extracellular stimuli regulating c-di-AMP levels in bacteria are poorly understood, recent work has identified effector proteins which directly interact and alter the activity of DACs. These include the membrane bound CdaR and the phosphoglucosamine mutase GlmM which both bind directly to the membrane bound CdaA DAC and the recombination protein RadA which binds directly to the DNA binding DisA DAC. The genes encoding these multiprotein complexes are co-localised in many bacteria providing further support for their\nin Staphylococcus aureus Mutation in the c-di-AMP cyclase dacA affects fitness and resistance of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus c-di-AMP secreted by intracellular Listeria monocytogenes activates a host type I interferon response Cyclic di-AMP is critical for Listeria monocytogenes growth, cell wall homeostasis, and establishment of infection c-di-AMP reports DNA integrity during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis Cyclic di-AMP regulation of osmotic homeostasis is essential in group B Streptococcus Cyclic di-AMP homeostasis in Bacillus subtilis: Both lack and high level accumulation of the nucleotide are detrimental for cell growth Making and breaking of an essential poison: The cyclases and phosphodiesterases that produce and degrade the essential second messenger cyclic di-AMP in bacteria YybT is a signaling protein that contains a cyclic dinucleotide phosphodiesterase domain and a GGDEF domain with ATPase activity An HD-domain phosphodiesterase mediates cooperative hydrolysis of c-di-AMP to affect bacterial growth and virulence Structural and biochemical analysis of the essential\nthat is both essential and toxic upon accumulation. DisA Limits RecG Activities at Stalled or Reversed Replication Forks. The DNA damage checkpoint protein DisA and the branch migration translocase RecG are implicated in the preservation of genome integrity in reviving haploid Bacillus subtilis spores. DisA synthesizes the essential cyclic 3', 5'-diadenosine monophosphate (c\u2011di-AMP) second messenger and such synthesis is suppressed upon replication perturbation. In vitro, c-di-AMP synthesis is suppressed when DisA binds DNA structures that mimic stalled or reversed forks (gapped forks or Holliday junctions [HJ]). RecG, which does not form a stable complex with DisA, unwinds branched intermediates, and in the presence of a limiting ATP concentration and HJ DNA, it blocks DisA-mediated c-di-AMP synthesis. DisA pre-bound to a stalled or reversed fork limits RecG-mediated ATP hydrolysis and DNA unwinding, but not if RecG is pre-bound to stalled or reversed forks. We propose that RecG-mediated fork remodeling is a\neffect, down-regulated RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange. DisA bound to the substrate DNA downregulates RecA-mediated strand invasion and pairing in vitro, but in vivo this delay should provide more time for the repair of DNA lesions, thereby enhancing cell viability. RecA does not suppress the rate of c-di-AMP synthesis We next tested whether RecA-mediated intermediates (as D-loop structures) or RecA protein alone interacts with DisA and blocks c-di-AMP synthesis. To this end, the strand exchange reaction was performed in the presence of [\u03b132P]-ATP:ATP (at a ratio of 1:100,000). To measure both the DNA strand exchange and c-di-AMP synthesis they were independently quantified. As revealed in Figure 5A, DisA (lanes 3\u20137) or DisA, SsbA and RecO (lanes 8\u201312) did not catalyse DNA strand exchange. In the presence of 0.2 \u03bcM DisA only traces of c-di-AMP synthesis were observed, and in the presence of 0.4 \u03bcM DisA \u223c35% of the 5 mM ATP\nWe show that RecA, acting as an accessory protein, activates RadA/Sms to unwind the nascent lagging-strand of the branched intermediates rather than to branch migrate them. DisA limits the ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity of RadA/Sms C13A, and inhibits the helicase activity of RadA/Sms by a protein-protein interaction. Finally, RadA/Sms inhibits DisA-mediated c-di-AMP synthesis and indirectly inhibits cell proliferation, but RecA counters this negative effect. We propose that the interactions among DisA, RecA and RadA/Sms, which are mutually exclusive, contribute to generate the substrate for replication restart, regulate the c-di-AMP pool and limit fork restoration in order to maintain cell survival. Bacillus subtilis DisA regulates RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange Abstract Bacillus subtilis diadenylate cyclase DisA converts two ATPs into c-di-AMP, but this activity is suppressed upon interaction with sites of DNA damage. DisA forms a rapid moving focus that pauses upon induction of DNA damage during spore development. We report that DisA\nBacillus subtilis Crystal structures of the c-di-AMP-synthesizing enzyme CdaA Cyclic-di-AMP synthesis by the diadenylate cyclase CdaA is modulated by the peptidoglycan biosynthesis enzyme GlmM in Lactococcus lactis Replenishing the cyclic-di-AMP pool: Regulation of diadenylate cyclase activity in bacteria An extracytoplasmic protein and a moonlighting enzyme modulate synthesis of c-di-AMP in Listeria monocytogenes Phenotypes associated with the essential diadenylate cyclase CdaA and its potential regulator CdaR in the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes Cytoplasmic steps of peptidoglycan biosynthesis Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state Crystal structure of Bacillus anthracis phosphoglucosamine mutase, an enzyme in the peptidoglycan biosynthetic pathway CheckMyMetal: A macromolecular metal-binding validation tool ConSurf: Using evolutionary data to raise testable hypotheses about protein function Solution structure of the PAS domain of a thermophilic YybT protein homolog reveals a potential ligand-binding site Unusual heme-binding PAS domain from YybT family proteins Bacillus subtilis DisA helps to circumvent replicative stress during spore revival\n(lane 12), RecA-mediated strand exchange between the css and homologous lds was reduced \u223c10-fold by DisA D77N. To further substantiate whether DisA affects RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange by a direct interaction of the proteins rather than by producing c-di-AMP, the three-strand exchange reaction was performed in the presence of increasing c-di-AMP concentrations. RecA\u00b7dATP alone (Supplementary Figure S5, lanes 2 versus 3\u20137) or RecA\u00b7ATP in the presence of SsbA and RecO as mediators (Supplementary Figure S5, lanes 8 versus 9\u201313) was insensitive to increasing c-di-AMP concentrations. It is likely, therefore, that DisA itself rather than its synthesized product, c-di-AMP, inhibits RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange. To test whether DisA binds to and competes with RecA for substrate binding, and indirectly inhibits RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange, DisA was replaced by DisA \u0394C290 (a mutant lacking the DNA binding domain), and the three-strand exchange reaction was performed. RecA-mediated strand exchange was reduced \u223c2-fold by\ndegradation of the second messenger. Accumulation of c-di-AMP in a gdpP pgpH double mutant is toxic for the cells, and the cells respond to this accumulation by inactivation of the diadenylate cyclase CdaA.IMPORTANCE: Bacteria use second messengers for signal transduction. Cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) is the only second messenger known so far that is essential for a large group of bacteria. We have studied the regulation of c-di-AMP synthesis and the role of the phosphodiesterases that degrade this second messenger. c-di-AMP synthesis strongly depends on the nitrogen source: glutamate-grown cells produce more c-di-AMP than glutamine-grown cells. The accumulation of c-di-AMP in a strain lacking both phosphodiesterases is toxic and results in inactivation of the diadenylate cyclase CdaA. Our results suggest that CdaA is the critical diadenylate cyclase that produces the c-di-AMP that is both essential and toxic upon accumulation. DisA Limits RecG Activities at Stalled or Reversed Replication Forks. The DNA\nDNA damage. We propose that the DisA focus scans along the chromosomes searching for lesions. Upon encountering a lesion, DisA delays entry into sporulation until the damage is repaired. Control of the diadenylate cyclase CdaS in Bacillus subtilis: an autoinhibitory domain limits cyclic di-AMP production. The Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis encodes three diadenylate cyclases that synthesize the essential signaling nucleotide cyclic di-AMP. The activities of the vegetative enzymes DisA and CdaA are controlled by protein-protein interactions with their conserved partner proteins. Here, we have analyzed the regulation of the unique sporulation-specific diadenylate cyclase CdaS. Very low expression of CdaS as the single diadenylate cyclase resulted in the appearance of spontaneous suppressor mutations. Several of these mutations in the cdaS gene affected the N-terminal domain of CdaS. The corresponding CdaS mutant proteins exhibited a significantly increased enzymatic activity. The N-terminal domain of CdaS consists of two \u03b1-helices and is attached to\nthe DNA damage site. To test whether deletion of the HhH motif (DisA \u0394C290) affects the capacity to produce c-di-AMP, the protein was purified and analysed. As expected, wt DisA converted a pair of ATPs into c-di-AMP, but DisA D77N, carrying a D77N active site mutation that inactivates the DAC activity, did not (Supplementary Figure S2E). The absence of HhH DNA binding domain reduced the DAC activity of DisA \u0394C290 by 15- to 20-fold when compared to wt DisA (Supplementary Figure S2E), suggesting that in vitro the C-terminal DNA binding domain of DisA is crucial for its DAC activity. We then tested whether a disA \u0394C290 mutation impairs cell survival (Supplementary Figure S2F). As revealed in Supplementary Material, Annex 1, in the absence of DNA damage ectopic expression of the disA \u0394C290 mutant gene significantly reduced cell viability when compared to \u0394disA or disA D77N cells (Supplementary Figure S2F). Deletion\n(HJ) resolvase RecU in response to DNA damage. We provide genetic evidence damage. Functional DisA-YFP formed dynamic foci in exponentially growing cells, which moved through the nucleoids at a speed compatible with a DNA-scanning mode. DisA formed more static structures in the absence of RecU or RecG than in wild type cells, while dynamic foci were still observed in cells lacking the BMT RuvAB. Purified DisA synthesizes c-di-AMP, but interaction with RadA/Sms or with HJ DNA decreases DisA-mediated c-di-AMP synthesis. RadA/Sms-YFP also formed dynamic foci in growing cells, but the foci moved throughout the cells rather than just on the nucleoids, and co-localized rarely with DisA-YFP foci, suggesting that RadA/Sms and DisA interact only transiently in unperturbed conditions. Our data suggest a model in which DisA moving along dsDNA indicates absence of DNA damage/replication stress via normal c-di-AMP levels, while interaction with HJ DNA/halted forks leads to reduced c-di-AMP levels\nfound to interact with and regulate the activity of c-di-AMP cyclases. The B. subtilis DisA protein is involved in monitoring the genomic stability ensuring that damaged DNA is repaired before cells progress with the sporulation process or exit from spores. DisA is encoded in a multigene operon and the gene immediately upstream of disA codes for RadA (also referred to as SMS). B. subtilis RadA possesses 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 DNA helicase activity, contributes to DNA repair and DNA transformation processes in B. subtilis, and has been shown to interact and negatively impact the activity of DisA. However, the mechanistic basis of how RadA binding to DisA inhibits the cyclase is currently not known. There is now ample evidence that the activity of the \u201chouse-keeping\u201d membrane-linked c-di-AMP cyclase CdaA is impacted by two interacting proteins, the membrane-linked regulator protein CdaR and the cytoplasmic phosphoglucomutase enzyme GlmM. We have provided experimental evidence\nabsence of the indicated condition. (B) In parallel the DAC activity of DisA was measured. The reaction products were separated by TLC and quantified using ImageJ. The quantification values of relative c-di-AMP amounts are shown, and the positions of the substrate (ATP), the intermediate (pppApA) and the product (c-di-AMP) are indicated. DisA suppresses RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange in the absence of ATP hydrolysis DisA can convert two molecules of the poorly hydrolysable ATP analogue (ATP\u03b3S) into c-di-AMP, and RecA\u00b7ATP\u03b3S can catalyze DNA strand exchange only in the presence of SsbA and RecO, albeit with \u223c2-fold lower efficiency than RecA\u00b7ATP (Supplementary Figure S6, lanes 2 vs 12). To test whether DisA, by inhibiting ATP hydrolysis-dependent RecA-DNA binding dynamics, or by binding to the recombination products produced by RecA, prevents DNA strand exchange, and if c-di-AMP synthesized in cis exerted a negative effect in RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange, the reaction was performed\nof Medical Sciences, Newcastle University, NE24HH, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.

Transcription factor IID (TFIID) nucleates transcription initiation complex formation by direct core promoter binding and mediates the action of transcriptional activators, in part via direct interactions with them. Molecular studies of the TFIID complex have identified multiple subunits whose potential interactions can be recapitulated in vitro with recombinant polypeptides. Here we report the cloning of human TATA box binding protein (TBP)-associated factor 20 (TAF20) and the consequent identification of an additional, related TFIID subunit, human TAF15 (hTAF15). Multiple TAF20/15 interactions have been detected within native TFIID preparations and further analyzed with recombinant subunits. Along with the demonstration of a high affinity association between TAF20/15 and TBP, the present results suggest that hTAF20/15 may complement hTAF250 in directing the association of TAFs with TBP to form a TFIID complex.

Proteomics of the eukaryotic transcription machinery: identification of proteins associated with components of yeast TFIID by multidimensional mass spectrometry. The general transcription factor TFIID is a multisubunit complex of TATA-binding protein (TBP) and 14 distinct TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Although TFIID constituents are required for transcription initiation of most mRNA encoding genes, the mechanism of TFIID action remains unclear. To gain insight into TFIID function, we sought to generate a proteomic catalogue of proteins specifically interacting with TFIID subunits. Toward this end, TFIID was systematically immunopurified by using polyclonal antibodies directed against each subunit, and the constellation of TBP- and TAF-associated proteins was directly identified by coupled multidimensional liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. A number of novel protein-protein associations were observed, and several were characterized in detail. These interactions include association between TBP and the RSC chromatin remodeling complex, the TAF17p-dependent association of the Swi6p transactivator protein\nRawConverter Identification of cross-linked peptides from complex samples KAT2A/KAT2B-targeted acetylome reveals a role for PLK4 acetylation in preventing centrosome amplification The PRIDE database and related tools and resources in 2019: Improving support for quantification data Supporting information A simple protocol to purify human TFIID free of the MED26 subunit of mediator complex. The general transcription factor TFIID is a multiprotein complex that is essential for specific transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. It is composed of the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and ~13 different TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Purification of TFIID free of other general transcription factors and coactivators is essential to analyze the transcription regulatory mechanisms in reconstituted systems in vitro. A breakthrough in TFIID purification was the generation of HeLa cell lines that express a FLAG epitope-tagged TBP subunit and immunopurification protocols with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies. Purification of TFIID from HeLa nuclear extracts generally required a two-step purification procedure\nThese interactions include association between TBP and the RSC chromatin remodeling complex, the TAF17p-dependent association of the Swi6p transactivator protein with TFIID, and the identification of three novel subunits of the SAGA acetyltransferase complex, including a putative ubiquitin-specific protease component. Our results provide important new insights into the mechanisms of mRNA gene transcription and demonstrate the feasibility of constructing a complete proteomic interaction map of the eukaryotic transcription apparatus. Functional silencing of TATA-binding protein (TBP) by a covalent linkage of the N-terminal domain of TBP-associated factor 1. General transcription factor TFIID is comprised of TATA-binding protein (TBP) and TBP-associated factors (TAFs), together playing critical roles in regulation of transcription initiation. The TAF N-terminal domain (TAND) of yeast TAF1 containing two subdomains, TAND1 (residues 10-37) and TAND2 (residues 46-71), is sufficient to interact with TBP and suppress the TATA binding activity of TBP. However, the detailed structural analysis of the complex\nnumerous genetic and biochemical studies. By combining the interaction profiles presented here, and the available studies utilizing specific TAFs, we propose a working hypothesis for the arrangement of components in the TFIID complex. Thus, these results serve as a foundation for understanding the overall architecture of yeast TFIID. Cytoplasmic TAF2-TAF8-TAF10 complex provides evidence for nuclear holo-TFIID assembly from preformed submodules. General transcription factor TFIID is a cornerstone of RNA polymerase II transcription initiation in eukaryotic cells. How human TFIID-a megadalton-sized multiprotein complex composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and 13 TBP-associated factors (TAFs)-assembles into a functional transcription factor is poorly understood. Here we describe a heterotrimeric TFIID subcomplex consisting of the TAF2, TAF8 and TAF10 proteins, which assembles in the cytoplasm. Using native mass spectrometry, we define the interactions between the TAFs and uncover a central role for TAF8 in nucleating the complex. X-ray crystallography reveals a non-canonical arrangement of\nRNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription requires a highly concerted, stepwise assembly of transcription factor complexes that form the preinitiation complex (PIC). A functional PIC consists of Pol II and six general transcription factors (GTFs): TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH. The evolutionary conserved TFIID complex is the first GTF that binds gene promoters and along with other GTFs, acts as a platform for PIC formation and consequent transcription initiation. TFIID is a multisubunit complex of about 1 MDa, composed of the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and 13 (14 in yeast) TBP-associated factors (TAFs). TFIID not only is essential for the recognition of core promoter sequences and the recruitment of the PIC, but also involved in gene expression via its interactions with cofactors, gene-specific activators and repressors, and chromatin modifications associated with active regions of the genome. TAF8 interactions in human TFIID.A, the human TFIID cryo-electron microscopy model is\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae TFIID. We previously defined Saccharomyces cerevisiae TFIID as a 15-subunit complex comprised of the TATA binding protein (TBP) and 14 distinct TBP-associated factors (TAFs). In this report we give a detailed biochemical characterization of this general transcription factor. We have shown that yeast TFIID efficiently mediates both basal and activator-dependent transcription in vitro and displays TATA box binding activity that is functionally distinct from that of TBP. Analyses of the stoichiometry of TFIID subunits indicated that several TAFs are present at more than 1 copy per TFIID complex. This conclusion was further supported by coimmunoprecipitation experiments with a systematic family of (pseudo)diploid yeast strains that expressed epitope-tagged and untagged alleles of the genes encoding TFIID subunits. Based on these data, we calculated a native molecular mass for monomeric TFIID. Purified TFIID behaved in a fashion consistent with this calculated molecular mass in both gel filtration and rate-zonal sedimentation\nrecognition and binding of the TATA element by the transcription factor TFIID. TFIID is composed of TATA binding protein (TBP) and approximately a dozen TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Emerging consensus regarding the role of TAFs is that TFIID assumes a gene specific activity that is regulated by interaction with other factors. In spite of many studies demonstrating the essential nature of TAFs in transcription, very little is known about the subunit contacts within TFIID. To understand fully the functional role of TAFs, it is imperative to define TAF-TAF interactions and their topological arrangement within TFIID. We performed a systematic two-hybrid analysis using the 13 essential TAFs of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae TFIID complex and TBP. Specific interactions were defined for each component, and the biological significance of these interactions is supported by numerous genetic and biochemical studies. By combining the interaction profiles presented here, and the available studies utilizing specific TAFs, we\ngene, COP1, which encodes a putative transcription factor that is though to regulate development. We have expressed recombinant dTAFII80 and begun to characterize its interaction with other members of the TFIID complex. Purified recombinant dTAFII80 is unable to bind TBP directly or to interact strongly with the C-terminal domain of dTAFII250 (delta N250). Instead, dTAFII80 is only able to recognize and interact with a higher-order complex containing TBP, delta N250, 110 and 60. These findings suggest the formation of TFIID may require an ordered assembly of the TAFs, some of which bind directly to TBP and others that are tethered to the complex as a result of specific TAF/TAF interactions. Cloning and characterization of human TAF20/15. Multiple interactions suggest a central role in TFIID complex formation. TFIID is a multiprotein complex that plays a central role in the initiation and regulation of class II transcription. Transcription factor IID (TFIID) nucleates\nTFIID. Purified TFIID behaved in a fashion consistent with this calculated molecular mass in both gel filtration and rate-zonal sedimentation experiments. Quite surprisingly, although the TAF subunits of TFIID cofractionated as a single complex, TBP did not comigrate with the TAFs during either gel filtration chromatography or rate-zonal sedimentation, suggesting that TBP has the ability to dynamically associate with the TFIID TAFs. The results of direct biochemical exchange experiments confirmed this hypothesis. Together, our results represent a concise molecular characterization of the general transcription factor TFIID from S. cerevisiae. The dTAFII80 subunit of Drosophila TFIID contains beta-transducin repeats. A key component of the RNA polymerase II transcriptional apparatus, TFIID, is a multi-protein complex containing the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and at least seven tightly associated factors (TAFs). Although the functions of most TFIID subunits are unknown, it is clear that TAFs are not necessary for basal activity but that one\nor in STAGA/TFTC HAT complexes. Here we show that TAF8 is absolutely necessary for the integration of TAF10 in a higher order TFIID core complex containing seven TAFs. TAF8 forms a heterodimer with TAF10 through its HF and proline rich domains, and also interacts with SPT7L through its C-terminal region, and the three proteins form a complex in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the TAF8-TAF10 and TAF10-SPT7L HF pairs, and also the SMAT complex, seem to be important regulators of the composition of different TFIID and/or STAGA/TFTC complexes in the nucleus and consequently may play a role in gene regulation. Introduction Transcription initiation of protein-coding genes by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) requires the ordered assembly of general transcription factors (GTFs) at the minimal promoter of these genes to form a functional preinitiation complex (PIC). Transcription factor TFIID, comprised of the TATA binding protein (TBP) and series of TBP-associated factors\na functional preinitiation complex (PIC). Transcription factor TFIID, comprised of the TATA binding protein (TBP) and series of TBP-associated factors (TAFs), is the GTF that by recognizing the promoter sequences allows the site specific assembly of the PIC. We have previously shown that in HeLa cells different human TFIID complexes, containing or lacking TAF10, exist, which exhibit functionally distinct properties. TAFs are not only integral components of TFIID, but are also found in the yeast Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetylase (SAGA) coactivator complex. Likewise in mammalian cells, TAFs are shared between TFIID and three very closely related multiprotein complexes, which we refer to as STAGA/TFTC-like complexes: the TBP-free TAF-containing complex (TFTC), the p300/CBP associated factor (PCAF) complex, the GCN5 complex and the SPT3-TAF9-GCN5 containing complex (STAGA).

Astonishingly however, in human TAF8 patient cells, we could not detect any cellular phenotype, significant changes in genome-wide Pol II occupancy and pre-mRNA transcription. Thus, the disorganization of the essential holo-TFIID complex did not affect global Pol II transcription in the patient's fibroblasts. Our observations further suggest that partial TAF complexes, and/or an altered TFIID containing a mutated TAF8, could support human development and thus, the absence of holo-TFIID is less deleterious for transcription than originally predicted. TAF8 regions important for TFIID lobe B assembly or for TAF2 interactions are required for embryonic stem cell survival The human general transcription factor TFIID is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and 13 TBP-associated factors (TAFs). In eukaryotic cells, TFIID is thought to nucleate RNA polymerase II (Pol II) preinitiation complex formation on all protein coding gene promoters and thus, be crucial for Pol II transcription. TFIID is\nthe TAFs and uncover a central role for TAF8 in nucleating the complex. X-ray crystallography reveals a non-canonical arrangement of the TAF8-TAF10 histone fold domains. TAF2 binds to multiple motifs within the TAF8 C-terminal region, and these interactions dictate TAF2 incorporation into a core-TFIID complex that exists in the nucleus. Our results provide evidence for a stepwise assembly pathway of nuclear holo-TFIID, regulated by nuclear import of preformed cytoplasmic submodules. Homozygous TAF8 mutation in a patient with intellectual disability results in undetectable TAF8 protein, but preserved RNA polymerase II transcription.

In a child with intellectual disability, mild microcephaly, corpus callosum agenesis and\nYeast two-hybrid map of Arabidopsis TFIID. General transcription factor IID (TFIID) is a multisubunit protein complex involved in promoter recognition and is fundamental to the nucleation of the RNA polymerase II transcriptional preinitiation complex. TFIID is comprised of the TATA binding protein (TBP) and 12-15 TBP-associated factors (TAFs). While general transcription factors have been extensively studied in metazoans and yeast, little is known about the details of their structure and function in the plant kingdom. This work represents the first attempt to compare the structure of a plant TFIID complex with that determined for other organisms. While no TAF3 homolog has been observed in plants, at least one homolog has been identified for each of the remaining 14 TFIID subunits, including both TAF14 and TAF15 which have previously been shown to be unique to either yeast or humans. The presence of both TAFs 14 and 15 in plants suggests ancient\nits chromatin-binding YEATS domain. Based on the Taf2-Taf14 genetic interaction, we demonstrate that Taf2 and Taf14 directly interact and mapped the Taf2-Taf14 interaction domains. We used this information to identify a Taf2 separation-of-function variant (Taf2-\u0394C). Although Taf2-\u0394C no longer interacts with Taf14 in vivo or in vitro, it stably incorporates into the TFIID complex. In addition, purified Taf2-\u0394C mutant TFIID is devoid of Taf14, making this variant a powerful reagent for determining the role of Taf14 in TFIID function. Furthermore, we characterized the mechanism through which Taf14 suppresses taf2ts alleles, shedding light on how Taf2-Taf14 interaction contributes to TFIID complex organization and identifying a potential role for Taf14 in mediating TFIID-chromatin interactions.

Human TAFII30 is present in a distinct TFIID complex and is required for transcriptional activation by the estrogen receptor.

The TBN protein, which is essential for early embryonic mouse development, is an inducible TAFII implicated in adipogenesis. Core promoter binding by histone-like TAF complexes. The nuclear import of TAF10 is regulated by one of its three histone fold domain-containing interaction partners.\nis composed of TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and 13 TBP-associated factors (Tafs). The mechanisms by which many Taf subunits contribute to the essential function of TFIID are only poorly understood. To address this gap in knowledge, we present the results of a molecular genetic dissection of the TFIID subunit Taf2. Through systematic site-directed mutagenesis, we have discovered 12 taf2 temperature-sensitive (ts) alleles. Two of these alleles display growth defects that can be strongly suppressed by overexpression of the yeast-specific TFIID subunit TAF14 but not by overexpression of any other TFIID subunit. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Taf14 is also a constituent of six other transcription-related complexes, making interpretation of its role in each of these complexes difficult. Although Taf14 is not conserved as a TFIID subunit in metazoans, it is conserved through its chromatin-binding YEATS domain. Based on the Taf2-Taf14 genetic interaction, we demonstrate that Taf2 and Taf14 directly interact and mapped",

A novel high-throughput screening (HTS) method with electrospray time-of-flight (ESI-TOF) mass spectrometry allows i) rapid and broad screening of multisubstrate enzyme catalytic activity towards a range of donor and acceptor substrates; ii) determination of full multisubstrate kinetic parameters and the binding order of substrates. Two representative glycosyltransferases (GTs, one common, one recently isolated, one O-glycosyltransferase (O-GT), one N-glycosyltransferase (N-GT)) have been used to validate this system: the widely used bovine beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.22), and the recently isolated Arabidopsis thaliana GT UGT72B1 (EC 2.4.1.-). The GAR (green/amber/red) broad-substrate-specificity screen, which is based on the mass ion abundance of product, provides a fast, high-throughput method for finding potential donors and acceptors from substrate libraries. This was evaluated by using six natural and non-natural donors (alpha-UDP-D-Glucose (UDPGlc), alpha-UDP-N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDPGlcNAc), alpha-UDP-D-5-thioglucose (UDP5SGlc), alpha-GDP-L-fucose (GDPFuc), alpha-GDP-D-mannose (GDPMan), alpha,beta-UDP-D-mannose (UDPMan)) and\nwas able to inhibit growth of fungal strains toxicity thus signifying its role as potent anti-fungal drug.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s42269-022-00711-5. The donor subsite of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase: binary complexes with UDP-glucose and UDP-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glucose at 2 A resolution. Trehalose is an unusual non-reducing disaccharide that plays a variety of biological roles, from food storage to cellular protection from environmental stresses such as desiccation, pressure, heat-shock, extreme cold, and oxygen radicals. It is also an integral component of the cell-wall glycolipids of mycobacteria. The primary enzymatic route to trehalose first involves the transfer of glucose from a UDP-glucose donor to glucose-6-phosphate to form alpha,alpha-1,1 trehalose-6-phosphate. This reaction, in which the configurations of two glycosidic bonds are set simultaneously, is catalyzed by the glycosyltransferase trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (OtsA), which acts with retention of the anomeric configuration of the UDP-sugar donor.

BACKGROUND: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau has gained popularity among Malaysians as a traditional plant for anti-inflammatory activity.OBJECTIVE: This prompted us to carry out the present study on a selected 11 constituents of C. nutans which are clinacoside A-C, cycloclinacoside A1, shaftoside, vitexin, orientin, isovitexin, isoorientin, lupeol and \u03b2-sitosterol.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Selected 11 constituents of C. nutans were evaluated on the docking behavior of xanthine oxidase (XO), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), human neutrophil elastase (HNE), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP 2 and 9), and squalene synthase (SQS) using Discovery Studio Version 3.1. Also, molecular physicochemical, bioactivity, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET), and toxicity prediction by computer assisted technology analyzes were also carried out.RESULTS: The molecular physicochemical analysis revealed that four ligands, namely clinacoside A-C and cycloclinacoside A1 showed nil violations and complied with Lipinski's rule of five. As for the analysis of bioactivity,\nwhich acts with retention of the anomeric configuration of the UDP-sugar donor. The classification of activated sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases into approximately 70 distinct families based upon amino acid sequence similarities places OtsA in glycosyltransferase family 20 (see afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/). The recent 2.4 A structure of Escherichia coli OtsA revealed a two-domain enzyme with catalysis occurring at the interface of the twin beta/alpha/beta domains. Here we present the 2.0 A structures of the E. coli OtsA in complex with either UDP-Glc or the non-transferable analogue UDP-2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucose. Both complexes unveil the donor subsite interactions, confirming a strong similarity to glycogen phosphorylases, and reveal substantial conformational differences to the previously reported complex with UDP and glucose 6-phosphate. Both the relative orientation of the two domains and substantial (up to 10 A) movements of an N-terminal loop (residues 9-22) characterize the more open \"relaxed\" conformation of the binary UDP-sugar complexes reported here.

The Vaccinia Virus H3 Envelope Protein, a Major Target of Neutralizing Antibodies, Exhibits a Glycosyltransferase Fold and Binds UDP-Glucose. UNLABELLED: The highly conserved H3 poxvirus protein is a major target of the human antibody response against poxviruses and is likely a key contributor to protection against infection. Here, we present the crystal structure of H3 from vaccinia virus at a 1.9-\u00c5 resolution. H3 looks like a glycosyltransferase, a family of enzymes that transfer carbohydrate molecules to a variety of acceptor substrates. Like glycosyltransferases, H3 binds UDP-glucose, as shown by saturation transfer difference (STD) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and this binding requires Mg(2+) Mutation of the glycosyltransferase-like metal ion binding motif in H3 greatly diminished its binding to UDP-glucose. We found by flow cytometry that H3 binds to the surface of human cells but\nHere, we present substrate- and product-bound cryogenic electron microscopy structures of the homotrimeric cellulose synthase isoform-8 (CesA8) from hybrid aspen (poplar). UDP-glucose binds to a conserved catalytic pocket adjacent to the entrance to a transmembrane channel. The substrate's glucosyl unit is coordinated by conserved residues of the glycosyltransferase domain and amphipathic interface helices. Site-directed mutagenesis of a conserved gating loop capping the active site reveals its critical function for catalytic activity. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal prolonged interactions of the gating loop with the substrate molecule, particularly across its central conserved region. These transient interactions likely facilitate the proper positioning of the substrate molecule for glycosyl transfer and cellulose translocation.

It is synthesized from UDP-activated glucose molecules by cellulose synthase, a membrane-integrated processive glycosyltransferase. Cellulose synthase couples the elongation of the cellulose polymer with its translocation across the plasma membrane. Here, we present substrate- and product-bound cryogenic electron microscopy structures of the homotrimeric cellulose synthase isoform-8 (CesA8) from hybrid aspen\ndrug. The objective of present study was molecular docking of lemon grass essential oil component citral and in vitro validation. GC-FID analysis was used to find out aromatic profile. For docking, Patch-dock analysis was used. Ligand Protein 2D and 3D Interactions were also studied. Drug likeliness, and toxicity profile were also studied. Docking analysis indicated effective binding of citral to UDP-glycosyltransferase, Glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase and chitin synthase. In vitro validation was performed by fungal strain Aspergillus fumigatum.RESULTS: GC-FID profiling revealed the presence of citral as major bioactive compound. Interactions results indicated that, UDP-glycosyltransferase, Glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase and chitin synthase enzymes and citral complexes forms hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions. Citral also depicted drug likeliness by LIPINSKY rule, sufficient level of bioactivity, drug likeliness and toxicity.CONCLUSION: In vitro results revealed that lemon grass oil was able to inhibit growth of fungal strains toxicity thus signifying its role as potent anti-fungal drug.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online\nA-C and cycloclinacoside A1 showed nil violations and complied with Lipinski's rule of five. As for the analysis of bioactivity, all the 11 selected constituents of C. nutans exhibited active score (>0) toward enzyme inhibitors descriptor. ADMET analysis showed that the ligands except orientin and isoorientin were predicted to have Cytochrome P4502D6 inhibition effect. Docking studies and binding free energy calculations revealed that clinacoside B exhibited the least binding energy for the target enzymes except for XO and SQS. Isovitexin and isoorientin showed the potentials in the docking and binding with all of the six targeted enzymes, whereas vitexin and orientin docked and bound with only NOS and HNE.CONCLUSION: This present study has paved a new insight in understanding these 11 C. nutans ligands as potential inhibitors against XO, NOS, HNE, MMP 2, MMP 9, and SQS.SUMMARY: Isovitexin and isoorientin (Clinacanthus nutans constituent) showed potentials in the docking and binding\n(alpha3GT) catalyzes the transfer of galactose from UDP-galactose to form an alpha 1-3 link with beta-linked galactosides; it is part of a family of homologous retaining glycosyltransferases that includes the histo-blood group A and B glycosyltransferases, Forssman glycolipid synthase, iGb3 synthase, and some uncharacterized prokaryotic glycosyltransferases. In mammals, the presence or absence of active forms of these enzymes results in antigenic differences between individuals and species that modulate the interplay between the immune system and pathogens. The catalytic mechanism of alpha3GT is controversial, but the structure of an enzyme complex with the donor substrate could illuminate both this and the basis of donor substrate specificity. We report here the structure of the complex of a low-activity mutant alpha3GT with UDP-galactose (UDP-gal) exhibiting a bent configuration stabilized by interactions of the galactose with multiple residues in the enzyme including those in a highly conserved region (His315 to Ser318). Analysis of the\nby using six natural and non-natural donors (alpha-UDP-D-Glucose (UDPGlc), alpha-UDP-N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDPGlcNAc), alpha-UDP-D-5-thioglucose (UDP5SGlc), alpha-GDP-L-fucose (GDPFuc), alpha-GDP-D-mannose (GDPMan), alpha,beta-UDP-D-mannose (UDPMan)) and 32 broad-ranging acceptors (sugars, plant hormones, antibiotics, flavonoids, coumarins, phenylpropanoids and benzoic acids). By using the fast-equilibrium assumption, KM, kcat and KIA were determined for representative substrates, and these values were used to determine substrate binding orders. These screening methods applied to the two very different enzymes revealed some unusual substrate specificities, thus highlighting the utility of broad-ranging substrate screening. For UGT72B1, it was shown that the donor specificity is determined largely by the nucleotide moiety. The method is therefore capable of identifying GT enzymes with usefully broad carbohydrate-transfer ability. Molecular Docking Analysis of Selected Clinacanthus nutans Constituents as Xanthine Oxidase, Nitric Oxide Synthase, Human Neutrophil Elastase, Matrix Metalloproteinase 2, Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 and Squalene Synthase Inhibitors. BACKGROUND: Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau has gained popularity among Malaysians as a\ngalactose with multiple residues in the enzyme including those in a highly conserved region (His315 to Ser318). Analysis of the properties of mutants containing substitutions for these residues shows that catalytic activity is strongly affected by His315 and Asp316. The negative charge of Asp316 is crucial for catalytic activity, and structural studies of two mutants show that its interaction with Arg202 is needed for an active site structure that facilitates the binding of UDP-gal in a catalytically competent conformation. Essential oil from Cymbopogon citratus exhibits \"anti-aspergillosis\" potential: in-silico molecular docking and in vitro studies. BACKGROUND: Aspergillosis, has recently confounded some states of India. Due to major role in fungal cell wall synthesis, in the present study UDP-glycosyltransferase, Glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase and chitin synthase were chosen as an appropriate sites to design drug. The objective of present study was molecular docking of lemon grass essential oil component citral and in vitro validation.\nrecognizes may allow a better understanding of how the vaccine elicits immunity and how improved vaccines can be developed. Poxvirus protein H3 is a major target of the immune system. The H3 crystal structure shows that it has a glycosyltransferase protein fold. We demonstrate that H3 binds the sugar nucleotide UDP-glucose, as do glycosyltransferases. Our experiments also reveal that H3 binds cell surface molecules that are involved in the attachment of poxviruses to cells. These structural and functional studies of H3 will help in designing better vaccines and therapeutics.\ndiminished its binding to UDP-glucose. We found by flow cytometry that H3 binds to the surface of human cells but does not bind well to cells that are deficient in surface glycosaminoglycans. STD NMR experiments using a heparin sulfate decasaccharide confirmed that H3 binds heparin sulfate. We propose that a surface of H3 with an excess positive charge may be the binding site for heparin. Heparin binding and glycosyltransferase activity may be involved in the function of H3 in the poxvirus life cycle.IMPORTANCE: Poxviruses are under intense research because of bioterrorism concerns, zoonotic infections, and the side effects of existing smallpox vaccines. The smallpox vaccine using vaccinia virus has been highly successful, but it is still unclear why the vaccine is so effective. Studying the antigens that the immune system recognizes may allow a better understanding of how the vaccine elicits immunity and how improved vaccines can be developed. Poxvirus\nsomnifera. UNLABELLED: Medicinal plants are extensively utilized in traditional and herbal medicines, both in India and around the world due to the presence of diverse low molecular weight natural products such as flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids and sterols. Flavonoids which have health benefits for humans are the large class of phenylpropanoid-derived secondary metabolites and are mostly glycosylated by UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs). Although large numbers of different UGTs are known from higher plants, very few protein structures have been reported till now. In the present study, the three-dimensional model of flavonoid specific glycosyltransferases (WsFGT) from Withania somnifera was constructed based on the crystal structure of plant UGTs. The resulted model was assessed by various tools and the final refined model revealed GT-B type fold. Further, to understand the sugar donors and acceptors interactions with the active site of WsFGT, docking studies were performed. The amino acids from conserved PSPG box were interacted with",

Caveolin-3 associates with and affects the function of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 4. Targeting of ion channels to caveolae, a subset of lipid rafts, allow cells to respond efficiently to extracellular signals. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (HCN) 4 is a major subunit for the cardiac pacemaker. Caveolin-3 (Cav3), abundantly expressed in muscle cells, is responsible for forming caveolae. P104L, a Cav3 mutant, has a dominant negative effect on wild type (WT) Cav3 and associates with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy. HCN4 was previously shown to localize to lipid rafts, but how caveolae regulate the function of HCN4 is unknown. We hypothesize that Cav3 associates with HCN4 and regulates the function of HCN4 channel. In this study, we applied whole-cell patch clamp analysis, immunostaining, biotinylation, and immunoprecipitation methods to investigate\nslowed at most test potentials (eg, at -95 mV, tau_act(Src296) = 7,396 ms). Neither Src529 nor Src296 significantly altered HCN4 current density. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Src forms a complex with HCN4 in HEK293 cells and in rat ventricular myocytes. Our data provide a novel mechanism of if regulation by Src tyrosine phosphorylation. Long-QT syndrome-associated caveolin-3 mutations differentially regulate the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide gated channel 4. Background Caveolin-3 (cav-3) mutations are linked to the long-QT syndrome (LQTS) causing distinct clinical symptoms. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide channel 4 (HCN4) underlies the pacemaker current If. It associates with cav-3 and both form a macromolecular complex. Methods To examine the effects of human LQTS-associated cav-3 mutations on HCN4-channel function, HEK293-cells were cotransfected with HCN4 and wild-type (WT) cav-3 or a LQTS-associated cav-3 mutant (T78M, A85T, S141R, or F97C). HCN4 currents were recorded using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Results WT cav-3 significantly decreased HCN4 current\nMitochondrial ROS were increased by Trx2 deletion and importantly, mitochondria-specific ROS scavenger MitoTEMPO suppressed HDAC4 elevation, HCN4 reduction, and sinus bradycardia in Trx2ccsKO mice.CONCLUSION: In the conduction system, Trx2 is critical for maintaining HCN4-mediated normal heart rate. Loss of Trx2 reduces HCN4 expression via a mitochondrial ROS-HDAC4-MEF2C pathway and subsequently induces sick sinus syndrome in mice. A novel mechanism of modulation of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels by Src kinase. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN1-4) play a crucial role in the regulation of cell excitability. Importantly, they contribute to spontaneous rhythmic activity in brain and heart. HCN channels are principally activated by membrane hyperpolarization and binding of cAMP. Here, we identify tyrosine phosphorylation by Src kinase as another mechanism affecting channel gating. Inhibition of Src by specific blockers slowed down activation kinetics of native and heterologously expressed HCN channels. The same effect on HCN channel activation was observed in cells cotransfected\nstate of the HCN2 channel pore. Thus, we conclude that the leucine zipper of HCN channels is a major determinant for hyperpolarization-activated channel gating. Mitochondrial thioredoxin-2 maintains HCN4 expression and prevents oxidative stress-mediated sick sinus syndrome. OBJECTIVE: Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) is associated with loss of HCN4 (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel 4) function in the cardiac conduction system. The underlying mechanism for SSS remains elusive. This study is to investigate how mitochondrial oxidative stress induces HCN4 downregulation associated with in sick sinus syndrome.METHODS AND RESULTS: Trx2lox/lox mice were crossed with \u03b1-myosin heavy chain (\u03b1-Mhc)-Cre and Hcn4-CreERT2 deleter mice to generate Trx2 deletion mice in the whole heart (Trx2cKO) and in the conduction system (Trx2ccsKO), respectively. Echocardiography was applied to measure hemodynamics and heart rhythm. Histological analyses, gene profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation were performed to define the mechanism by which thioredoxin-2 (Trx2) regulates HCN4 expression and cardiac function.

BACKGROUND: It is poorly understood how hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCNs) function.RESULTS: We have identified a leucine zipper in the S5 segment of HCNs, regulating hyperpolarization-activated and instantaneous current components.CONCLUSION: The leucine zipper is essential for HCN channel gating.SIGNIFICANCE: The identification and functional characterization of the leucine zipper is an important step toward the understanding of HCN channel function. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are pacemakers in cardiac myocytes and neurons. Although their membrane topology closely resembles that of voltage-gated K(+) channels, the mechanism of their unique gating behavior in response to hyperpolarization is still poorly understood. We have identified a highly conserved leucine zipper motif in the S5 segment of HCN family members. In order to study the role of this motif for channel function, the leucine residues of the zipper were individually mutated to alanine, arginine, or glutamine residues.\nHCN2 mRNA. In neonatal rat myocytes in which HCN2 was knocked down, there was also a simultaneous decrease in HCN4 mRNA. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that HCN2 and HCN4 channel proteins can associate with each other in adult rat ventricles. Finally, in adult myocytes overexpressing HCN4, the hyperpolarization-activated inward current activation, I(f), was shifted to physiological voltages from non-physiological voltages, associated with faster activation kinetics. These data suggested that different ratios of HCN2 and HCN4 transcripts overlapping in different tissues also contribute to the tissue-specific properties of I(f). Constitutively active Src tyrosine kinase changes gating of HCN4 channels through direct binding to the channel proteins. Cardiac pacemaker current, if, is generated by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels. Our previous studies demonstrated that altered tyrosine phosphorylation can modulate the properties of both if and HCN channels. To assess a hypothesis that the intracellular tyrosine kinase Src may play a role in modulation\nA85T, S141R, or F97C). HCN4 currents were recorded using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Results WT cav-3 significantly decreased HCN4 current density and shifted midpoint of activation into negative direction. HCN4 current properties were differentially modulated by LQTS-associated cav-3 mutations. When compared with WT cav-3, A85T, F97C, and T78M did not alter the specific effect of cav-3, but S141R significantly increased HCN4 current density. Compared with WT cav-3, no significant modifications of voltage dependence of steady-state activation curves were observed. However, while WT cav-3 alone had no significant effect on HCN4 current activation, all LQTS-associated cav-3 mutations significantly accelerated HCN4 activation kinetics. Conclusions Our results indicate that HCN4 channel function is modulated by cav-3. LQTS-associated mutations of cav-3 differentially influence pacemaker current properties indicating a pathophysiological role in clinical manifestations. A leucine zipper motif essential for gating of hyperpolarization-activated channels. BACKGROUND: It is poorly understood how hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCNs)\nthis motif for channel function, the leucine residues of the zipper were individually mutated to alanine, arginine, or glutamine residues. Leucine zipper mutants traffic to the plasma membrane, but the channels lose their sensitivity to open upon hyperpolarization. Thus, our data indicate that the leucine zipper is an important molecular determinant for hyperpolarization-activated channel gating. Residues of the leucine zipper interact with the adjacent S6 segment of the channel. This interaction is essential for voltage-dependent gating of the channel. The lower part of the leucine zipper, at the intracellular mouth of the channel, is important for stabilizing the closed state. Mutations at these sites increase current amplitudes or result in channels with deficient closing and increased min-P(o). Our data are further supported by homology models of the open and closed state of the HCN2 channel pore. Thus, we conclude that the leucine zipper of HCN channels is a major determinant\nPalmitoylation regulates the magnitude of HCN4-mediated currents in mammalian cells. The sinoatrial node (SAN) and subsidiary pacemakers in the cardiac conduction system generate spontaneous electrical activity which is indispensable for electrical and therefore contractile function of the heart. The hyperpolarisation-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel HCN4 is responsible for genesis of the pacemaker \"funny\" current during diastolic depolarisation. S-palmitoylation, the reversible conjugation of the fatty acid palmitate to protein cysteine sulfhydryls, regulates the activity of key cardiac Na+ and Ca2+ handling proteins, influencing their membrane microdomain localisation and function. We investigated HCN4 palmitoylation and its functional consequences in engineered human embryonic kidney 293T cells as well as endogenous HCN4 in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. HCN4 was palmitoylated in all experimental systems investigated. We mapped the HCN4 palmitoylation sites to a pair of cysteines in the HCN4 intracellular amino terminus. A double cysteine-to-alanine mutation CC93A/179AA of full length HCN4 caused a \u223c67% reduction\nalters HCN4 function and could cause a reduction of cardiac pacemaker activity. Associated changes in HCN2 and HCN4 transcripts and I(f) pacemaker current in myocytes. The time- and voltage-dependent inward current generated by the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels contributes to the tissue-specific rhythmic activities in the brain and heart. Four isoforms (HCN1-HCN4) have been identified. Previous studies showed that different HCN isoforms may form functional heteromeric channels. We report here that when HCN2 and HCN4 mRNA were injected into Xenopus oocytes with various ratios of HCN2 over HCN4 at 1:1, 10:1, and 1:10, respectively, the resultant channels showed a depolarized current activation and significantly faster activation kinetics near the midpoint of activation compared with HCN4 homomeric channels. In adult rat myocytes overexpressing HCN4, there was an associated increase in HCN2 mRNA. In neonatal rat myocytes in which HCN2 was knocked down, there was also a simultaneous decrease in HCN4\nactivity. Isoform-specific regulation of HCN4 channels by a family of endoplasmic reticulum proteins. Ion channels in excitable cells function in macromolecular complexes in which auxiliary proteins modulate the biophysical properties of the pore-forming subunits. Hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-sensitive HCN4 channels are critical determinants of membrane excitability in cells throughout the body, including thalamocortical neurons and cardiac pacemaker cells. We previously showed that the properties of HCN4 channels differ dramatically in different cell types, possibly due to the endogenous expression of auxiliary proteins. Here, we report the discovery of a family of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane proteins that associate with and modulate HCN4. Lymphoid-restricted membrane protein (LRMP, Jaw1) and inositol trisphosphate receptor-associated guanylate kinase substrate (IRAG, Mrvi1, and Jaw1L) are homologous proteins with small ER luminal domains and large cytoplasmic domains. Despite their homology, LRMP and IRAG have distinct effects on HCN4. LRMP is a loss-of-function modulator that inhibits the canonical depolarizing\nkinetics of native and heterologously expressed HCN channels. The same effect on HCN channel activation was observed in cells cotransfected with a dominant-negative Src mutant. Immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Src binds to and phosphorylates native and heterologously expressed HCN2. Src interacts via its SH3 domain with a sequence of HCN2 encompassing part of the C-linker and the cyclic nucleotide binding domain. We identified a highly conserved tyrosine residue in the C-linker of HCN channels (Tyr476 in HCN2) that confers modulation by Src. Replacement of this tyrosine by phenylalanine in HCN2 or HCN4 abolished sensitivity to Src inhibitors. Mass spectrometry confirmed that Tyr476 is phosphorylated by Src. Our results have functional implications for HCN channel gating. Furthermore, they indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation contributes in vivo to the fine tuning of HCN channel activity. Isoform-specific regulation of HCN4 channels by a family of endoplasmic reticulum proteins. Ion channels in excitable cells function in\nchromatin immunoprecipitation were performed to define the mechanism by which thioredoxin-2 (Trx2) regulates HCN4 expression and cardiac function. Trx2cKO mice displayed dilated cardiomyopathy, low heart rate, and atrial ventricular block (AVB) phenotypes. Immunofluorescence revealed that HCN4 expression was specifically reduced within the sinoatrial node in Trx2cKO mice. Interestingly, Trx2ccsKO mice displayed low heart rate and AVB without dilated cardiomyopathy. Both mRNA and protein levels of HCN4 were reduced in the sinoatrial node, suggesting transcriptional HCN4 regulation upon Trx2 deletion. ChIP indicated that the binding of MEF2 to the HCN4 enhancer was not altered by Trx2 deletion; however, histone 3 acetylation at the MEF2 binding site was decreased, and expression of histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) was elevated following Trx2 deletion. Moreover, HDAC4 binding to the HCN4 enhancer was mediated by MEF2. Mitochondrial ROS were increased by Trx2 deletion and importantly, mitochondria-specific ROS scavenger MitoTEMPO suppressed HDAC4 elevation, HCN4 reduction, and sinus\ntheir homology, LRMP and IRAG have distinct effects on HCN4. LRMP is a loss-of-function modulator that inhibits the canonical depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of HCN4 in response to the binding of cAMP. In contrast, IRAG causes a gain of HCN4 function by depolarizing the basal voltage dependence in the absence of cAMP. The mechanisms of action of LRMP and IRAG are independent of trafficking and cAMP binding, and they are specific to the HCN4 isoform. We also found that IRAG is highly expressed in the mouse sinoatrial node where computer modeling predicts that its presence increases HCN4 current. Our results suggest important roles for LRMP and IRAG in the regulation of cellular excitability, as tools for advancing mechanistic understanding of HCN4 channel function, and as possible scaffolds for coordination of signaling pathways.\nfunction of HCN4 channel. In this study, we applied whole-cell patch clamp analysis, immunostaining, biotinylation, and immunoprecipitation methods to investigate this hypothesis. The immunoprecipitation results indicated an association of HCN4 and Cav3 in the heart and in HEK293 cells. Our immunostaining results showed that HCN4 colocalized with Cav3 but only partially colocalized with P104L in HEK293 cells. Transient expression of Cav3, but not P104L, in HEK 293 cells stably expressing HCN4 caused a 45% increase in HCN4 current (IHCN4) density. Transient expression of P104L caused a two-fold increase in the activation time constant for IHCN4 and shifted the voltage of the steady-state inactivation to a more negative potential. We conclude that HCN4 associates with Cav3 to form a HCN4 macromolecular complex. Our results indicated that disruption of caveolae using P104L alters HCN4 function and could cause a reduction of cardiac pacemaker activity. Associated changes in HCN2 and HCN4 transcripts and\nif and HCN channels. To assess a hypothesis that the intracellular tyrosine kinase Src may play a role in modulation by tyrosine phosphorylation of if, we cotransfected HEK293 cells with HCN4 and Src proteins. When HCN4 was cotransfected with a constitutively activated Src protein (Src529), the resultant voltage-dependent HCN4 activation was positively shifted (HCN4: V1/2 = -93 mV; Src529: V1/2 = -80 mV). The activation kinetics were accelerated at some potentials but not over the entire voltage range tested (eg, at -95 mV, tau_act(HCN4) = 3,243 ms; tau_act(Src529) = 1,113 ms). When HCN4 was cotransfected with a dominant negative Src protein (Src296), the HCN4 activation was shifted more negative to a smaller degree (HCN4: V1/2 = -93 mV; Src296: V1/2 = -98 mV; statistically insignificant) and the activation kinetics were slowed at most test potentials (eg, at -95 mV, tau_act(Src296) = 7,396 ms). Neither Src529 nor Src296 significantly altered HCN4\ncysteines in the HCN4 intracellular amino terminus. A double cysteine-to-alanine mutation CC93A/179AA of full length HCN4 caused a \u223c67% reduction in palmitoylation in comparison to wild type HCN4. We used whole-cell patch clamp to evaluate HCN4 current (IHCN4) in stably transfected 293T cells. Removal of the two N-terminal palmitoylation sites did not significantly alter half maximal activation voltage of IHCN4 or the activation slope factor. IHCN4 was significantly larger in cells expressing wild type compared to non-palmitoylated HCN4 across a range of voltages. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that although cysteine 93 is widely conserved across all classes of HCN4 vertebrate orthologs, conservation of cysteine 179 is restricted to placental mammals. Collectively, we provide evidence for functional regulation of HCN4 via palmitoylation of its amino terminus in vertebrates. We suggest that by recruiting the amino terminus to the bilayer, palmitoylation enhances the magnitude of HCN4-mediated currents, but does not significantly affect the",

Two cDNAs encoding novel K(+) channels, THIK-1 and THIK-2 (tandem pore domain halothane inhibited K(+) channel), were isolated from rat brain. The proteins of 405 and 430 amino acids were 58% identical to each other. Homology analysis showed that the novel channels form a separate subfamily among tandem pore domain K(+) channels. The genes of the human orthologs were identified as human genomic data base entries. They possess one intron each and were assigned to chromosomal region 14q24.1-14q24.3 (human (h) THIK-1) and 2p22-2p21 (hTHIK-2). In rat (r), THIK-1 (rTHIK-1) is expressed ubiquitously; rTHIK-2 expression was found in several tissues including brain and kidney. In situ hybridization of brain slices showed that rTHIK-2 is strongly expressed in most brain regions, whereas rTHIK-1 expression is more restricted. Heterologous expression of\ninhibitor, genistein, represents a novel molecular mechanism to alter background K+ currents. Regulation of the two-pore domain potassium channel, THIK-1 and THIK-2, by G protein coupled receptors. A member of THIK (two pore domain halothane-inhibited K+) channels, THIK-1, was reported as a target of Gi/o-coupled receptors (Gi/o-Rs) in neurons and microglia. We confirmed that in HEK293T cells the THIK-1 channel is activated by Gi/o-Rs and found that Gq-coupled receptors (Gq-Rs) also activates the channel. The effects of Gi/o-Rs and Gq-Rs were inhibited by the Gi/o inhibitor pertussis toxin and phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor, respectively. The effects of Gi/o-Rs were attenuated when consensus G\u03b2\u03b3 binding motif at the C-tail of the THIK-1 channel was mutated, suggesting that G\u03b2\u03b3 serves as a THIK-1 channel activator upon the stimulation of Gi/o-Rs. As to the effects of Gq-Rs on the THIK-1 channel, a protein kinase C inhibitor and calcium chelators failed to inhibit the\nslices showed that rTHIK-2 is strongly expressed in most brain regions, whereas rTHIK-1 expression is more restricted. Heterologous expression of rTHIK-1 in Xenopus oocytes revealed a K(+) channel displaying weak inward rectification in symmetrical K(+) solution. The current was enhanced by arachidonic acid and inhibited by halothane. rTHIK-2 did not functionally express. Confocal microscopy of oocytes injected with green fluorescent protein-tagged rTHIK-1 or rTHIK-2 showed that both channel subunits are targeted to the outer membrane. However, coinjection of rTHIK-2 did not affect the currents induced by rTHIK-1, indicating that the two channel subunits do not form heteromers. \u03b2-COP Suppresses the Surface Expression of the TREK2. K2P channels, also known as two-pore domain K+ channels, play a crucial role in maintaining the cell membrane potential and contributing to potassium homeostasis due to their leaky nature. The TREK, or tandem of pore domains in a weak inward rectifying K+ channel (TWIK)-related K+\nbreakdown of cAMP and thus activates protein kinase A (PKA). Surprisingly, THIK-1 current was inhibited when IBMX was applied from the extracellular side of the membrane, but not from the intracellular side. Our results suggest that IBMX binds directly to the channel and that the inhibition of THIK-1 current was not related to activation of PKA. Formation of Functional Heterodimers by TREK-1 and TREK-2 Two-pore Domain Potassium Channel Subunits. Two-pore domain (K2P) potassium channels are the major molecular correlates of the background (leak) K(+) current in a wide variety of cell types. They generally play a key role in setting the resting membrane potential and regulate the response of excitable cells to various stimuli. K2P channels usually function as homodimers, and only a few examples of heteromerization have been previously reported. Expression of the TREK (TWIK-related K(+) channel) subfamily members of K2P channels often overlaps in neurons and in other\nthe effects of Gq-Rs on the THIK-1 channel, a protein kinase C inhibitor and calcium chelators failed to inhibit the effect of a Gq coupled muscarinic M1R. Neither the hydrolysis of phosphatidyl inositol bisphosphate induced by voltage sensitive phosphatase nor the application of a diacylglycerol analogue, OAG, increased the channel current. The mediator of Gq-dependent activation of the THIK-1 channel remained unsolved. The effects of Gi/o- and Gq-Rs on the THIK-2 channel were also investigated, by using a THIK-2 mutant channel whose N-terminal domain is deleted to improve the surface membrane expression. We observed that Gi/o- and Gq-Rs activate the mutated THIK-2 channel, similarly to the THIK-1 channel. Interestingly, heterodimeric channels of THIK-1 and THIK-2 responded to Gi/o-R and Gq-R stimulation. Taken together, Gi/o- or Gq-Rs activates the THIK-1 and THIK-2 channels in a G\u03b2\u03b3 or PLC dependent manner, respectively. THIK-1 and THIK-2, a novel subfamily of tandem pore domain\ndiversity and additional means by which they can be regulated in their native tissues. Tandem pore domain halothane-inhibited K+ channel subunits THIK1 and THIK2 assemble and form active channels. Despite a high level of sequence homology, tandem pore domain halothane-inhibited K(+) channel 1 (THIK1) produces background K(+) currents, whereas THIK2 is silent. This lack of activity is due to a unique combination of intracellular retention and weak basal activity in the plasma membrane. Here, we designed THIK subunits containing dominant negative mutations (THIK1(DN) and THIK2(DN)). THIK2(DN) mutant inhibits THIK1 currents, whereas THIK1(DN) inhibits an activated form of THIK2 (THIK2-A155P-I158D). In situ proximity ligation assays and F\u00f6rster/fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments support a physical association between THIK1 and THIK2. Next, we expressed covalent tandems of THIK proteins to obtain expression of pure heterodimers. Td-THIK1-THIK2 (where Td indicates tandem) produces K(+) currents of amplitude similar to Td-THIK1-THIK1 but with a noticeable\nK2P currents in Xenopus oocytes. In addition, K2P channels were studied in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using the whole-cell patch clamp technique.KEY RESULTS: Here, we report inhibition of human K2P3.1 (TASK-1) currents by the TK antagonist, genistein, in Xenopus oocytes (IC50=10.7 microM) and in CHO cells (IC50=12.3 microM). The underlying molecular mechanism was studied in detail. hK2P3.1 was not affected by genistin, an inactive analogue of genistein. Perorthovanadate, an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatase activity, reduced the inhibitory effect of genistein. Current reduction was voltage independent and did not require channel protonation at position H98 or phosphorylation at the single TK phosphorylation site, Y323. Among functional hK2P family members, genistein also reduced K2P6.1 (TWIK-2), K2P9.1 (TASK-3) and K2P13.1 (THIK-1) currents, respectively.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Modulation of K2P channels by the TK inhibitor, genistein, represents a novel molecular mechanism to alter background K+ currents. Regulation of the two-pore domain potassium channel, THIK-1\ncurrents were also inhibited by extracellular application of IBMX. Expression of THIK-1 channels in Xenopus oocytes was used to compare wild-type channels with mutated channels. Mutation of the putative PKA phosphorylation sites did not change the inhibitory effect of IBMX on THIK-1 currents. Mutational analysis of all residues of the (extracellular) helical cap of THIK-1 showed that mutation of the arginine residue at position 92, which is in the linker between cap helix 2 and pore helix 1, markedly reduced the inhibitory effect of IBMX. This flexible linker region, which is unique for each K2P-channel subtype, may be a possible target of channel-specific blockers. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The potassium channel THIK-1 is strongly expressed in the central nervous system. We studied the effect of 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (IBMX) on THIK-1 currents. IBMX inhibits breakdown of cAMP and thus activates protein kinase A (PKA). Surprisingly, THIK-1 current was inhibited when IBMX was applied from\nThe Phosphodiesterase Inhibitor IBMX Blocks the Potassium Channel THIK-1 from the Extracellular Side. The two-pore domain potassium channel (K2P-channel) THIK-1 has several predicted protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation sites. In trying to elucidate whether THIK-1 is regulated via PKA, we expressed THIK-1 channels in a mammalian cell line (CHO cells) and used the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (IBMX) as a pharmacological tool to induce activation of PKA. Using the whole-cell patch-clamp recording, we found that THIK-1 currents were inhibited by application of IBMX with an IC50 of 120 \u00b5M. Surprisingly, intracellular application of IBMX or of the second messenger cAMP via the patch pipette had no effect on THIK-1 currents. In contrast, extracellular application of IBMX produced a rapid and reversible inhibition of THIK-1. In patch-clamp experiments with outside-out patches, THIK-1 currents were also inhibited by extracellular application of IBMX. Expression of THIK-1 channels in Xenopus oocytes was used to compare\nred. These features were clearly observed when the channels were expressed individually. However, when TASK-1 and TASK-3 were expressed together, the resulting current showed intermediate pH sensitivity and ruthenium red insensitivity (characteristic of TASK-1), indicating the formation of TASK-1/TASK-3 heterodimers. Expression of a tandem construct in which TASK-3 and TASK-1 were linked together yielded currents with features very similar to those observed when coexpressing the two channels. The tandem construct also responded to AT(1a) angiotensin II receptor stimulation with an inhibition that was weaker than the inhibition of homodimeric TASK-1 and greater than that shown by TASK-3. Expression of epitope-tagged channels in mammalian cells showed their primary presence in the plasma membrane consistent with their function in this location. Heteromerization of two-pore domain potassium channels may provide a greater functional diversity and additional means by which they can be regulated in their native tissues. Tandem pore domain halothane-inhibited K+ channel\nof TREK-1/TREK-2 channels was also demonstrated in native dorsal root ganglion neurons indicating that heterodimerization may provide greater diversity of leak K(+) conductances also in native tissues. Regulation of two-pore-domain (K2P) potassium leak channels by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Two-pore-domain potassium (K2P) channels mediate potassium background (or 'leak') currents, controlling excitability by stabilizing membrane potential below firing threshold and expediting repolarization. Inhibition of K2P currents permits membrane potential depolarization and excitation. As expected for key regulators of excitability, leak channels are under tight control from a plethora of stimuli. Recently, signalling via protein tyrosine kinases (TKs) has been implicated in ion channel modulation. The objective of this study was to investigate TK regulation of K2P channels.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The two-electrode voltage clamp technique was used to record K2P currents in Xenopus oocytes. In addition, K2P channels were studied in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using the whole-cell\nreported. Expression of the TREK (TWIK-related K(+) channel) subfamily members of K2P channels often overlaps in neurons and in other excitable cells. Here, we demonstrate that heterologous coexpression of TREK-1 and TREK-2 subunits results in the formation of functional heterodimers. Taking advantage of a tandem construct (in which the two different subunits were linked together to enforce heterodimerization), we characterized the biophysical and pharmacological properties of the TREK-1/TREK-2 current. The heteromer was inhibited by extracellular acidification and by spadin similarly to TREK-1, and its ruthenium red sensitivity was intermediate between TREK-1 and TREK-2 homodimers. The heterodimer has also been distinguished from the homodimers by its unique single channel conductance. Assembly of the two different subunits was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged TREK-1 and TREK-2 subunits, coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes. Formation of TREK-1/TREK-2 channels was also demonstrated in native dorsal root ganglion neurons indicating that heterodimerization may provide greater diversity of\nemphasize the unique role of \u03b2-COP in regulating the surface expression of the TREK family. Formation of functional heterodimers between the TASK-1 and TASK-3 two-pore domain potassium channel subunits. The potassium channels in the two-pore domain family are widely expressed and regulate the excitability of neurons and other excitable cells. These channels have been shown to function as dimers, but heteromerization between the various channel subunits has not yet been reported. Here we demonstrate that two members of the TASK subfamily of potassium channels, TASK-1 and TASK-3, can form functional heterodimers when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. To recognize the two TASK channel types, we took advantage of the higher sensitivity of TASK-1 over TASK-3 to physiological pH changes and the discriminating sensitivity of TASK-3 to the cationic dye ruthenium red. These features were clearly observed when the channels were expressed individually. However, when TASK-1 and TASK-3 were expressed together,\nto their leaky nature. The TREK, or tandem of pore domains in a weak inward rectifying K+ channel (TWIK)-related K+ channel, subfamily within the K2P family consists of mechanical channels regulated by various stimuli and binding proteins. Although TREK1 and TREK2 within the TREK subfamily share many similarities, \u03b2-COP, which was previously known to bind to TREK1, exhibits a distinct binding pattern to other members of the TREK subfamily, including TREK2 and the TRAAK (TWIK-related acid-arachidonic activated K+ channel). In contrast to TREK1, \u03b2-COP binds to the C-terminus of TREK2 and reduces its cell surface expression but does not bind to TRAAK. Furthermore, \u03b2-COP cannot bind to TREK2 mutants with deletions or point mutations in the C-terminus and does not affect the surface expression of these TREK2 mutants. These results emphasize the unique role of \u03b2-COP in regulating the surface expression of the TREK family. Formation of functional heterodimers between\nof pure heterodimers. Td-THIK1-THIK2 (where Td indicates tandem) produces K(+) currents of amplitude similar to Td-THIK1-THIK1 but with a noticeable difference in the current kinetics. Unlike Td-THIK2-THIK2 that is mainly detected in the endoplasmic reticulum, Td-THIK1-THIK2 distributes at the plasma membrane, indicating that THIK1 can mask the endoplasmic reticulum retention/retrieval motif of THIK2. Kinetics and unitary conductance of Td-THIK1-THIK2 are intermediate between THIK1 and THIK2. Altogether, these results show that THIK1 and THIK2 form active heteromeric channels, further expanding the known repertoire of K(+) channels.",

Probing the determinants of phosphorylated sugar-substrate binding for human sialic acid synthase. N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuNAc), the most naturally abundant sialic acid, is incorporated as the terminal residue of mammalian cell surface glycoconjugates and acts as a key facilitator of cellular recognition, adhesion and signalling. Several pathogenic bacteria similarly express NeuNAc on their cell surfaces, allowing evasion of their host's immune system. Prokaryotic NeuNAc biosynthesis proceeds\nA homozygous mutation in CMAS causes autosomal recessive intellectual disability in a Kazakh family. Intellectual disability (ID) describes a wide range of serious human diseases caused by defects in central nervous system development and function. Some mutant genes have been found to be associated with these diseases, but not all cases can be explained, thus suggesting that other disease-causing genes have not yet been discovered. Sialic acid is involved in a number of key biological processes, including embryo formation, nerve cell growth, and cancer cell metastasis, and very recently it has been suggested that N-acetylneuraminic acid synthase-mediated synthesis of sialic acid is required for brain and skeletal development. CMP-sialic acid synthetase (CMAS) is one of four enzymes involved in NeuNAc metabolism, as it catalyzes the formation of CMP-NeuNAc. Before the present study, no links between mutations in CMAS and incidences of human ID had been reported. In the current study,\npathogenic bacteria similarly express NeuNAc on their cell surfaces, allowing evasion of their host's immune system. Prokaryotic NeuNAc biosynthesis proceeds via condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) with N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc), a reaction catalysed by the domain-swapped homodimeric enzyme, N-acetylneuraminic acid synthase (NeuNAcS). Conversely, the mammalian orthologue, N-acetylneuraminic acid 9-phosphate synthase (NeuNAc 9-PS) utilises the phosphorylated substrate N-acetylmannosamine 6-phosphate (ManNAc 6-P) in catalysis. Here we report an investigation into the determinants of substrate specificity of human NeuNAc 9-PS, using model-guided mutagenesis to delineate binding interactions with ManNAc 6-P. Modelling predicts the formation of a domain-swapped homodimer as observed for bacterial variants, which was supported by experimental small angle X-ray scattering. A number of conserved residues which may play key roles in the selection of ManNAc 6-P were identified and substituted for alanine to assess their function. Lys290 and Thr80 were identified as a putative phosphate binding pair, with the cationic lysine residue extending\ncells (Figures 7C\u2013E). Overall, these results indicate that in this model an up-regulation of the principal CMA components, Lamp2A and Hsc70, specifically occurs in response to the overexpression of the aggregation-prone form of TDP-43. TDP-43 aggregation up-regulates Lamp2A and Hsc70 expression. The HEK293 Flp-in, HEK293 Flag-TDP-43 WT and HEK293 Flag-TDP-12xQ/N cell lines were incubated with tetracycline at indicated time points. (A) Relative Lamp2A and (B) Hsc70 mRNA levels were evaluated by RT-qPCR. Changes for each gene were calculated using the mean of the change in Ct values (\u0394Ct) normalized to the Ct values of \u03b2-actin for each sample (2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct). Graphics were performed using the mean of 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct from three independent experiments. Statistics were performed using ANOVA two-way. Numerical results are reported as mean \u00b1 SE.

An unrelated siRNA was used as control (see \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d section).

The remaining levels of Flag-TDP-12xQ/N were evaluated by Western blot at indicated time points. (E) Densitometric quantification of Flag-TDP-12xQ/N from (D). (F) Lamp2A siRNA was transfected in HEK293 Flp-in as indicated in (B) and the protein levels of endogenous TDP-43 were evaluated by Western blot at indicated time points. (G) Densitometric quantification of endogenous TDP-43 from (F). Quantifications showed in (C,E,G) were\ndifferent forms of TDP-43 indicated in Figure 3A (Flag-TDP-43 WT, Flag-TDP-12xQ/N and endogenous TDP-43). For this, cells expressing Flag-TDP-43 WT, Flag-TDP-12xQ/N and endogenous TDP-43 were incubated with tetracycline and transfected with siLamp2A. After 48 h, the tetracycline was washed out (time point 0) and the protein levels of TDP-43 were evaluated at the indicated time points. An additional pulse of siLamp2A was added at time points 24 h and 54 h to maintain the protein depletion (siLamp2A efficiency was around 60%, Supplementary Figure S1). As it can be observed, at different time points upon tetracycline washout, an increase in the protein levels of Flag-TDP-43 WT (Figures 3B,C), Flag-TDP-12xQ/N (Figures 3D,E) and endogenous TDP-43 (Figures 3F,G) was observed in Lamp2A down-regulated cells. Thus, these results indicate that CMA loss of function, through Lamp2A down-regulation, affects the turnover of endogenous TDP-43 as well as of the overexpressed Flag-TDP-43 WT and the aggregate-prone\nthrough Lamp2A down-regulation, affects the turnover of endogenous TDP-43 as well as of the overexpressed Flag-TDP-43 WT and the aggregate-prone form Flag-TDP-12xQ/N. Wild Type and the Aggregated-Prone Form of TDP-43 Are Present in the Lysosomal Fractions Isolated From Cell Culture The previous experiments suggested that Flag-TDP-43 WT and the aggregated-prone form Flag-TDP-12xQ/N can be CMA substrates. To confirm this, we addressed whether both TDP-43 forms were present in CMA lysosomal fractions isolated from their respective cell lines. As shown, lysosomal fractions from both cell lines were enriched with Lamp2A and GAPDH proteins, indicating a high content of CMA positive lysosomes (Figures 4A,B, line 5). In these lysosomal samples, the Flag-TDP-43 WT protein (Figure 4A, line 5, upper band) and the aggregate-prone form Flag-TDP-12xQ/N were clearly detected (Figure 4B, line 5). Regarding the endogenous TDP-43 form, a faint band was observed in the cell line over-expressing Flag-TDP-43 WT (Figure 4A, line\nas a CMA activity activator (Kaushik and Cuervo,; Koga et al.,; Patel and Cuervo,) and with the aim of enhancing the interaction between the TDP-43 forms and the Hsc70 protein. Immunoprecipitation of both overexpressed TDPs forms (Flag-TDP-43 WT and Flag-TDP-12xQ/N) was efficiently carried out with an anti-Flag antibody (Figure 5A and Supplementary Figure S2A). Interestingly, compared with Flag-TDP-43 WT and the control cell line, co-precipitation of Hsc70 was only detected with the TDP-43 aggregated-prone form (Flag-TDP-12xQ/N) under \u2212STV and +STV conditions (Figure 5B and Supplementary Figure S2B, respectively). Next, we wanted to confirm the interaction of the TDP-43 aggregated form with Hsc70. To test this, we generated a stable cell line that overexpressed EGFP-Hsc70 fusion protein under the tetracycline control. After tetracycline stimulation, the cell line was transiently transfected with plasmids expressing Flag-TDP-43 WT, Flag-TDP-12xQ/N or empty plasmid pcDNA5 FRT/TO. Next, the co-localization of EGFP-Hsc70 with endogenous TDP-43 or Flag-tagged\nflagged proteins (Flag-TDP-43 WT and Flag-TDP-12xQ/N). Used antibodies were the following: anti-TDP-43 antibody (red, upper panels) an anti-Flag antibody (red, middle and lower panels).

However, Hsc70 has also been implicated in the\nTDP-43 prone to aggregate (Flag-TDP-12xQ/N; Budini et al.,). In the experiments, HEK293 Flag-TDP-43 WT (expressing a Flag-TDP-43 WT form) and HEK293 Flp-in (expressing endogenous TDP-43) were used as control (Figure 3A). Protein levels of wild type and aggregated-prone forms of TDP-43 increase after inhibition of CMA.

(B) Lamp2A down-regulation was carried out in HEK293 Flag-TDP-43 WT cell line by transfecting an interfering RNA against human Lamp2A (siLamp2A). The expression of Flag-TDP-43 WT was induced for 48 h and then tetracycline was removed. The remaining levels of Flag-TDP-43 WT were evaluated by Western blot at indicated time points.\naggregation of TDP-43 induces Lamp2A overexpression and that CMA could be implicated in the degradation of the aggregated-prone form at early stages of the aggregation process. In addition, the results also suggest that prolonged exposure to TDP-43 aggregates, the perinuclear localization of Lamp2A can be affected. However, additional experiments need to be performed to further confirm this idea. Subcellular distribution of Lamp2A along different time points of TDP-43 aggregation. (A) The HEK293 Flp-in cell or HEK293 Flag-TDP-12xQ/N cell lines were incubated with tetracycline at indicated time points. Next, an immunofluorescence assay was performed to evaluate the distribution pattern of Flag-TDP-12xQ/N protein and Lamp2A. Used antibodies were the following: anti-Flag antibody (red) and anti-Lamp2A antibody (green). At 6 and 12 h white arrow indicate the co-localization (yellow) between Flag-TDP-12xQ/N and Lamp2A. Dotted white lines insets show a magnification of one co-localization event. Images are representative of three independent experiments. (B) Mean\ndistribution in treated cells (Figure 9, compare A with B). In some cases, Gal3 puncta co-localized with Lamp2A positive lysosomes (Figure 9B, right panel, yellow dots). Interestingly, after 72 h of aggregate induction, Gal 3 also showed a cytoplasmic puncta distribution in the Flag-TDP-12xQ/N expressing cell line (Figure 9C, green dots). In addition, we observed Gal3 puncta surrounding Lamp2A positive lysosomes (Figure 9C, yellow dots indicated by arrows and Figure 9D) or directly co-localizing with them (Figure 9C, yellow dots indicated by arrows heads and Figure 9D). This result supports the idea that TDP-43 aggregation can also affect the integrity of lysosomes associated with CMA. Lysosomal damage in TDP-43 aggregates producing cells. Subcellular localization of Galectin 3 (Gal3) was evaluated by immunofluorescence. (A) Control HEK293 cell line without 1 mM of LLOMe for 2 h. (B) Control HEK293 cell line with 1 mM of LLOMe for 2 h. Green Gal3\nRegarding the endogenous TDP-43 form, a faint band was observed in the cell line over-expressing Flag-TDP-43 WT (Figure 4A, line 5, lower band). Endogenous TDP-43 is downregulated in cells overexpressing Flag-TDP-43 WT (Avenda\u00f1o-V\u00e1zquez et al.,), explaining why low levels of endogenous TDP-43 are observed in these samples. However, endogenous TDP-43 was clearly observed in the cell line over-expressing Flag-TDP-12xQ/N (Figure 4B, line 5). Altogether these results support the idea that TDP-43 WT and its aggregated-prone form are CMA substrates in cell culture. Wild type and aggregated-prone TDP-43 forms are present in lysosomal fractions isolated from cell culture. (A) The lysosomal fraction was isolated from cell line over-expressing Flag-TDP-43 WT during 72 h, then endogenous, as well as Flag-tagged protein was evaluated by Western blot. (B) The lysosomal fraction was isolated from cell line over-expressing Flag-TDP-12xQ/N during 72 h, then endogenous, as well as Flag-tagged protein was evaluated by Western blot.\nGel. Immunoprecipitated Flag-tagged proteins were analyzed by Western blot using an anti-Flag M2 antibody.

Western blots are representative from at least three independent experiments. Aggregated-prone form of TDP-43 co-localizes with Hsc70. (A) HEK293 stably transfected with a plasmid expressing the EGFP-Hsc70 fusion protein were incubated with tetracycline for 24 h to allow the overexpression of the EGFP-Hsc70 protein. After tetracycline stimulation, the cell line was transiently transfected for 48 h with plasmids expressing Flag-TDP-43 WT, Flag-TDP-12xQ/N or the corresponding empty plasmid (pcDNA5 FRT/TO). Next, an immunofluorescence assay was performed to evaluate the co-localization of EGFP-Hsc70 with endogenous TDP-43 or the flagged proteins (Flag-TDP-43 WT and Flag-TDP-12xQ/N). Used antibodies were the following: anti-TDP-43 antibody (red, upper panels) an anti-Flag antibody (red,\nco-localization when ICQ = 0.5. By applying these analyses, the co-localization between EGFP-Hsc70 and endogenous TDP-43 was practically undetected (Figures 6A\u2013D). However, a discrete co-localization between EGFP-Hsc70 and Flag-TDP-43 WT could be observed (Figures 6A\u2013C,E). Interestingly, and supporting the results obtained in the IP experiment, the aggregate-prone form of TDP-43 strongly co-localized with EGFP-Hsc70 (Figures 6A\u2013C,F). When compared together, the aggregate-prone was the form that higher co-colocalized with EGFP-Hcs70 (Figure 6G). Overall these results indicate that, in the studied cell lines, preferentially the aggregation-prone form TDP-12xQ/N is able to interact with the CMA component Hsc70. Aggregated-prone form of TDP-43 co-precipitates with Hsc70. (A) The HEK293 Flp-in, HEK293 Flag-TDP-43 WT and HEK293 Flag-TDP-12xQ/N cell lines were incubated with tetracycline for 72 h. Then, immunoprecipitation was performed using an Anti-Flag M2 Affinity Gel. Immunoprecipitated Flag-tagged proteins were analyzed by Western blot using an anti-Flag M2 antibody.

Materials and Methods Lysosomal Isolation From Rat Tissues Male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (250 g) were maintained with water and food ad libitum. All procedures were approved by the Bioethics Committee of Fundaci\u00f3n Ciencia and Vida. Subcellular fractions enriched in intact lysosomes were prepared according to Juste and Cuervo. Forty-eight hours (48 h) before the experiments, two rats were starved and then euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation followed by cervical dislocation. Then, livers and brains were dissected and washed several times in cold 0.25 M sucrose pH 7.2 to remove any remaining blood. The two livers were processed separately, whereas the two brains were pooled for brain lysosomal isolation. Tissues were homogenized in cold room with three volumes\nfrom cell line over-expressing Flag-TDP-12xQ/N during 72 h, then endogenous, as well as Flag-tagged protein was evaluated by Western blot.

Aggregated-Prone Form of TDP-43 Interacts With Hsc70-CMA Component in Cell Culture Then, we characterized whether wild type or TDP-43 aggregated-prone form were able to interact with the CMA the component Hsc70. For this, the control cell line, or the ones expressing Flag-TDP-43 WT or Flag-TDP-12xQ/N, were induced with tetracycline and then subjected or not to serum deprivation (+STV and \u2212STV, respectively). We used serum deprivation condition as a CMA activity activator (Kaushik and Cuervo,; Koga et al.,; Patel and Cuervo,) and with the aim of enhancing\ntetracycline (Sigma-Aldrich). Transient transfections were carried out with 0.5 \u03bcg of plasmids using Effectene reagent (Qiagen). Lysosome Isolation From Cell Lines The protocol for lysosomal isolation from cells was performed according to Storrie and Madden and Agarraberes et al. and was used by other authors to study CMA (Storrie and Madden,; Terlecky and Dice,). Specifically, for every cell line, 8 \u00d7 105 cells were cultured in four 150 mm plates and after washing with cold PBS, they were scrapped with 2 ml of PBS and collected by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min 4\u00b0C. Then cells were washed and finally resuspended in 2 ml of 2.5 M sucrose pH 7.2 and lysed by nitrogen cavitation. Samples were centrifuged at 2,500 g for 15 min 4\u00b0C and postnuclear supernatant (PNS) placed on the top of a Nycodenz gradient (2 ml 35% Nycodenz/0, 25 M Sucrose, 2 ml 17% Nycodenz/0, 25\neach protein in CMA+ and CMA\u2212 lysosomal were calculated. The calculated proportions from three independent experiments were used to obtain the final graph. Numerical results are reported as mean \u00b1 SE.

Inhibition of CMA Increases Protein Levels of Wild Type and an Aggregate-Prone Form of TDP-43 The previous experiments confirmed that TDP-43 is a CMA substrate. However, up to date, nothing is known about the relationship between TDP-43 aggregation and CMA. To study this aspect, we used a cellular TDP-43 aggregation model previously reported. Briefly, this model is a tetracycline-inducible HEK293 cell line overexpressing a specific form of TDP-43 prone to aggregate (Flag-TDP-12xQ/N; Budini et al.,). In the experiments, HEK293 Flag-TDP-43 WT (expressing a Flag-TDP-43 WT form) and",

The amino acid sequence of mLV1 was 96 % identical to a Kir channel cloned from human kidney (hKir4.2), and approximately 60 % identical to the Kir4.1 channel cloned from human and rat, so that mLV1 was classified as mKir4.2. 2. Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNA encoding mKir4.2 displayed a large inwardly rectifying K+ current, while control oocytes injected with H2O displayed no similar K+ current. The current was blocked by Ba2+ and Cs+ in a voltage-dependent fashion and displayed inward rectification that was intermediate between that of the strong inward rectifier Kir2.1 and the weak inward rectifier Kir1.1. The current was weakly blocked by TEA in a voltage-independent fashion. 3. mKir4.2 current was subject to modulation by several distinct mechanisms. Intracellular acidification decreased mKir4.2 current in a reversible fashion,\nfunctional channels in Xenopus oocytes, that these Kir channels display novel properties, and that Kir4.2 subunits may be responsible for physiological modulation of functional Kir channels. Tamoxifen inhibits inward rectifier K+ 2.x family of inward rectifier channels by interfering with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-channel interactions. Tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor antagonist used in the treatment of breast cancer, inhibits the inward rectifier potassium current (I(K1)) in cardiac myocytes by an unknown mechanism. We characterized the inhibitory effects of tamoxifen on Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3 potassium channels that underlie cardiac I(K1). We also studied the effects of 4-hydroxytamoxifen and raloxifene. All three drugs inhibited inward rectifier K(+) 2.x (Kir2.x) family members. The order of inhibition for all three drugs was Kir2.3 > Kir2.1 approximately Kir2.2. The onset of inhibition of Kir2.x current by these compounds was slow (T(1/2) approximately 6 min) and only partially recovered after washout ( approximately 30%). Kir2.x inhibition was concentration-dependent\n(vi) Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed interaction between the N- and C-terminal intracellular domains of different Kir2.x subunits. Coexpression of Kir2.1 mutants related to Andersen's syndrome with wild-type Kir2.x channels showed a dominant negative effect, the extent of which varied between different mutants. Our results suggest that differential tetramerization of the mutant allele of Kir2.1 with wild-type Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3 channels represents the molecular basis of the extraordinary pleiotropy of Andersen's syndrome. Expression of a functional Kir4 family inward rectifier K+ channel from a gene cloned from mouse liver. 1. A low stringency polymerase chain reaction (PCR) homology screening procedure was used to probe a mouse liver cDNA library to identify novel inward rectifier K+ channel genes. A single gene (mLV1) was identified that exhibited extensive sequence homology with previously cloned inward rectifier K+ channel genes. The mLV1 gene showed greatest sequence identity with genes belonging to the Kir4 subfamily.\nIdentification of G protein-coupled, inward rectifier potassium channel gene products from the rat anterior pituitary gland. Dopamine (DA) is a physiological regulator of PRL secretion, exerting tonic inhibitory control. DA activates an inward rectifier K(+) (IRK) channel in rat lactotropes, causing membrane hyperpolarization and inhibition of Ca(2+)-dependent action potentials. Both the activation of this effector K(+) channel and the inhibition of PRL release are mediated by D(2)-type receptor activation and pertussis toxin- sensitive G proteins. To study the molecular basis of this physiologically relevant channel, a homology-based PCR approach was employed to identify members of the IRK channel family expressed in the anterior pituitary gland. Nondegenerate primers corresponding to regions specific for IRK channels known to be G protein activated (GIRKs; gene subfamily Kir 3.0) were synthesized and used in the PCR with reverse transcribed female rat anterior pituitary messenger RNA as the template. PCR products of predicted sizes for\nThe point mutation I331R in the GIRK1 C terminus or L337R in the GIRK4 C terminus decreased the association between the N and C termini. Mutation of a GIRK1 N-terminal hydrophobic residue, predicted structurally to interact with the C-terminal domain, also resulted in a decrease in channel function and termini association. We hypothesize that the hydrophobic nature of this GIRK1 subunit region is critical for interaction between adjacent termini and is permissive for channel gating. In addition, the homologous mutation in cytoplasmic domains of Kir2.1 (L330R) did not disrupt association, suggesting that the overall structural integrity of this region is critical for inward rectifier function. Inward rectifier potassium currents as a target for atrial fibrillation therapy. Subunits of inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir) are expressed in many different tissues of the human body. Inward rectifier currents expressed in the heart are constituted by pore-forming alpha-subunits of Kir2, Kir3, and Kir6\ninward rectifier potassium channels. Inward rectifier potassium (Kir) channels act as cellular diodes, allowing unrestricted flow of potassium (K(+)) into the cell while preventing currents of large magnitude in the outward direction. The rectification mechanism by which this occurs involves a coupling between K(+) and intracellular blockers-magnesium (Mg(2+)) or polyamines-that simultaneously occupy the permeation pathway. In addition to the transmembrane pore, Kirs possess a large cytoplasmic domain (CD) that provides a favorable electronegative environment for cations. Electrophysiological experiments have shown that the CD is a key regulator of both conductance and rectification. In this study, we calculate and compare averaged equilibrium probability densities of K(+) and Cl(-) in open-pore models of the CDs of a weak (Kir1.1-ROMK) and a strong (Kir2.1-IRK) rectifier through explicit-solvent molecular-dynamics simulations in ~1 M KCl. The CD of both channels concentrates K(+) ions greater than threefold inside the cytoplasmic pore while IRK shows an additional\nlarger inward K(+) currents than oocytes injected with only one GIRK channel subtype. Ligand-dependent activation of only one of the GIRK combinations (GIRK1 and GIRK4) was observed when channel subunits were coexpressed with the D(2) receptor in Xenopus oocytes. Dose-response data fit to a Michaelis-Menten equation gave an apparent K(d) similar to that for DA binding in anterior pituitary tissue. GIRK1 and GIRK4 proteins were coimmunoprecipitated from anterior pituitary lysates, confirming the presence of native GIRK1/GIRK4 oligomers in this tissue. These data indicate that GIRK1 and GIRK4 are excellent candidate subunits for the D(2)-activated, G protein-gated channel in pituitary lactotropes, where they play a critical role in excitation-secretion coupling. Mutation of critical GIRK subunit residues disrupts N- and C-termini association and channel function. The subfamily of G-protein-linked inwardly rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs) is coupled to G-protein receptors throughout the CNS and in the heart. We used mutational analysis to address\nglial cells. uKATP-1 and BIR form with sulfonylurea receptors, the so-called ATP-sensitive K+ channels. Thus, it is a feature of the Kir channel family that each subfamily plays a specific physiological functional role. The (Na+)-activated Kir channels identified electrophysiologically in neurons and cardiac myocytes have not yet been cloned. In this review, we overviewed the current understandings of the features of the molecular structures and functions of the four main subfamilies of Kir channels. Heteromerization of Kir2.x potassium channels contributes to the phenotype of Andersen's syndrome. Andersen's syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder related to mutations of the potassium channel Kir2.1, is characterized by cardiac arrhythmias, periodic paralysis, and dysmorphic bone structure. The aim of our study was to find out whether heteromerization of Kir2.1 channels with wild-type Kir2.2 and Kir2.3 channels contributes to the phenotype of Andersen's syndrome. The following results show that Kir2.x channels can form functional heteromers: (i)\nchannels contributes to the phenotype of Andersen's syndrome. The following results show that Kir2.x channels can form functional heteromers: (i) HEK293 cells transfected with Kir2.x-Kir2.y concatemers expressed inwardly rectifying K(+) channels with a conductance of 28-30 pS. (ii) Expression of Kir2.x-Kir2.y concatemers in Xenopus oocytes produced inwardly rectifying, Ba(2+) sensitive currents. (iii) When Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 channels were coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes the IC(50) for Ba(2+) block of the inward rectifier current differed substantially from the value expected for independent expression of homomeric channels. (iv) Coexpression of nonfunctional Kir2.x constructs, in which the GYG region of the pore region was replaced by AAA, with wild-type Kir2.x channels produced both homomeric and heteromeric dominant-negative effects. (v) Kir2.1 and Kir2.3 channels could be coimmunoprecipitated in membrane extracts from isolated guinea pig cardiomyocytes. (vi) Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed interaction between the N- and C-terminal intracellular domains of different Kir2.x subunits. Coexpression of Kir2.1\na new family of K+ channels whose subunits contain two putative transmembrane domains and a pore-forming region. So far, more than ten cDNAs of Kir channel subunits have been isolated and classified into four subfamilies: 1) IRK subfamily (IRK1-3/Kir1.1-1.3), 2) GIRK subfamily (GIRK1-4/Kir3.1-3.4), 3) ATP-dependent Kir subfamily (ROMK1/Kir1.1, K(AB)-2/Kir4.1), and 4) ATP-sensitive Kir subfamily (uKATP-1/Kir6.1, BIR/Kir6.2). Xenopus oocytes injected with the cRNAs of IRKs elicit classical Kir channel currents. GIRKs, as heteromultimers, compose the G protein-gated Kir (KG) channels, which are regulated by a variety of Gi/Go-coupled inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors such as m2-mus-carinic, serotonergic (5HT1A), GABAB, somatostatin and opioid (mu, delta, kappa) receptors. ROMK1 and KAB-2 are characterized with a Walker type-A ATP-binding motif in their carboxyl termini, and may be involved in K+ transport in renal epithelial and brain glial cells. uKATP-1 and BIR form with sulfonylurea receptors, the so-called ATP-sensitive K+ channels. Thus, it is a feature of\nthe PCR with reverse transcribed female rat anterior pituitary messenger RNA as the template. PCR products of predicted sizes for Kir 3.1, 3.2, and 3.4 were consistently observed by ethidium bromide staining after 16 amplification cycles. The identities of the products were confirmed by subcloning and sequencing. Expression of each of these gene products in anterior pituitary was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. Functional analysis of the GIRK proteins was performed in the heterologous expression system, Xenopus laevis oocytes. Macroscopic K(+) currents were examined in oocytes injected with different combinations of Kir 3.0 complementary RNA (cRNA) and G protein subunit (beta(1)gamma(2)) cRNA. The current-voltage relationships demonstrated strong inward rectification for each individual and pairwise combination of GIRK channel subunits. Oocytes coinjected with any pair of GIRK subunit cRNA exhibited significantly larger inward K(+) currents than oocytes injected with only one GIRK channel subtype. Ligand-dependent activation of only one of the\nchannels. Modulation of I K1 rectification properties seems theoretically interesting for manipulation of Kir2 currents as an antiarrhythmic approach. Kir3-based muscarinic currents (I KACh) are functionally upregulated during AF through increased constitutive activity (passing current in the absence of an agonist). Upregulated I KACh supports sustenance of the arrhythmia. There is considerable intraatrial diversity in the expression of underlying Kir3.1/Kir3.4 subunits, but atrial-specific localization makes inhibition of this current a potentially interesting antiarrhythmic target devoid of ventricular side effects. Experimental studies of specific inhibitors indicate efficacy in various disease models. The role of I KATP remodeling under AF conditions has not been extensively studied, but present evidence indicates current downregulation and modulation of IKATP seems less promising than that of other inward rectifiers. Multi-ion distributions in the cytoplasmic domain of inward rectifier potassium channels. Inward rectifier potassium (Kir) channels act as cellular diodes, allowing unrestricted flow of potassium (K(+)) into\ncompounds was slow (T(1/2) approximately 6 min) and only partially recovered after washout ( approximately 30%). Kir2.x inhibition was concentration-dependent but voltage-independent. The time course and degree of inhibition was independent of external or internal drug application. We tested the hypothesis that tamoxifen interferes with the interaction between the channel and the membrane-delimited channel activator, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)). Inhibition of Kir2.3 currents was significantly reduced by a single point mutation of I213L, which enhances Kir2.3 interaction with membrane PIP(2). Pretreatment with PIP(2) significantly decreased the inhibition induced by tamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and raloxifene on Kir2.3 channels. Pretreatment with spermine (100 microM) decreased the inhibitory effect of tamoxifen on Kir2.1, probably by strengthening the channel's interaction with PIP(2). In cat atrial and ventricular myocytes, 3 microM tamoxifen inhibited I(K1), but the effect was greater in the former than the latter. The data strongly suggest that tamoxifen, its metabolite, and the estrogen receptor\n3. mKir4.2 current was subject to modulation by several distinct mechanisms. Intracellular acidification decreased mKir4.2 current in a reversible fashion, while activation of protein kinase C decreased mKir4.2 current in a manner that was not rapidly reversible. Incubation of oocytes in elevated [K+] produced a slowly developing enhancement of current. 4. Oocytes co-injected with cRNA for mKir4.2 and Kir5.1, a protein that does not form functional homomeric channels, displayed membrane currents with properties distinct from those expressing mKir4.2 alone. Co-injected oocytes displayed larger currents than mKir4.2, with novel kinetic properties and an increased sensitivity to Ba2+ block at negative potentials, suggesting that mKir4.2 forms functional heteromultimeric channels with Kir5.1, as has been shown for Kir4.1 5. These results demonstrate for the first time that a Kir4.2 channel gene product forms functional channels in Xenopus oocytes, that these Kir channels display novel properties, and that Kir4.2 subunits may be responsible for\nchannels (GIRKs) is coupled to G-protein receptors throughout the CNS and in the heart. We used mutational analysis to address the role of a specific hydrophobic region of the GIRK1 subunit. Deletion of the GIRK1 C-terminal residues 330-384, as well as the point mutation I331R, resulted in a decrease in channel function when coexpressed with GIRK4 in oocytes and in COS-7 cells. Surface protein expression of GIRK1 I331R coexpressed with GIRK4 was comparable with wild type, indicating that subunits assemble and are correctly localized to the membrane. Subsequent mutation of homologous residues in both the GIRK4 subunit and Kir2.1 (Gbetagamma-independent inward rectifier) also resulted in a decrease in channel function. Intracellular domain associations resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of the GIRK1 N and C termini and GIRK4 N and C termini. The point mutation I331R in the GIRK1 C terminus or L337R in the GIRK4 C terminus decreased the association between\nwas greater in the former than the latter. The data strongly suggest that tamoxifen, its metabolite, and the estrogen receptor inhibitor raloxifene inhibit Kir2.x channels indirectly by interfering with the interaction between the channel and PIP(2).\nunderstanding the actual mechanism of rectification blockade will require high-resolution structural information of the blocked state, these simulations provide insight into how sequence variation in the CD can affect the multi-ion distributions that underlie the mechanisms of conduction, rectification affinity, and kinetics. Inwardly rectifying potassium channels: their molecular heterogeneity and function. A variety of cells including cardiac myocytes and neuronal cells possess inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) channels through which currents flow more readily in the inward direction than outward. These K+ channels play pivotal roles in maintenance of the resting membrane potential, in regulation of the action potential duration, in receptor-dependent inhibition of cellular excitability, and in the secretion and absorption of K+ ions across cell membrane. Recent molecular biological dissection has shown that the DNAs encoding Kir channels constitute a new family of K+ channels whose subunits contain two putative transmembrane domains and a pore-forming region. So far, more\nthe human body. Inward rectifier currents expressed in the heart are constituted by pore-forming alpha-subunits of Kir2, Kir3, and Kir6 subfamilies. Characteristic properties of inward rectifiers comprise small outward conductances that nevertheless are important to terminal repolarization of cardiac action potentials. There is considerable difference in the regional expression of cardiac Kir channels, and subunits are additionally regulated by specific disease conditions. Resulting changes facilitate occurrence and persistence of atrial fibrillation (AF). For instance, upregulation of Kir2.1 protein and resultant current I K1 is a hallmark of AF-related ionic remodeling. Increased I K1 helps to stabilize atrial rotors, and current inhibition has accordingly been suggested as an antiarrhythmic approach for AF therapy. But there are caveats to I K1 inhibition per se, and there is no specific inhibitor of Kir2 channels. Modulation of I K1 rectification properties seems theoretically interesting for manipulation of Kir2 currents as an antiarrhythmic approach. Kir3-based\nThe CD of both channels concentrates K(+) ions greater than threefold inside the cytoplasmic pore while IRK shows an additional K(+) accumulation region near the cytoplasmic entrance. Simulations carried out with Mg(2+) or spermine (SPM(4+)) show that these ions interact with pore-lining residues, shielding the surface charge and reducing K(+) in both channels. The results also show that SPM(4+) behaves differently inside these two channels. Although SPM(4+) remains inside the CD of ROMK, it diffuses around the entire volume of the pore. In contrast, this polyatomic cation finds long-lived conformational states inside the IRK pore, interacting with residues E224, D259, and E299. The strong rectifier CD is also capable of sequestering an additional SPM(4+) at the cytoplasmic entrance near a cluster of negative residues D249, D274, E275, and D276. Although understanding the actual mechanism of rectification blockade will require high-resolution structural information of the blocked state, these simulations provide insight",

Structural and functional characterization of Kv6.2 a new gamma-subunit of voltage-gated potassium channel. We have cloned and functionally expressed Kv6.2, a new member of the Kv6 subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channel subunits. The human Kv6.2 (KCNF2) gene was mapped at 18q22-18q23. Kv6.2 mRNA is preferentially expressed in rat and human myocard. Rat and human Kv6.2 subunits appear to be unable to form functional Kv channels in a heterologous expression system, but, when coexpressed with Kv2.1 alpha subunits, heteromultimeric Kv channels were formed mediating voltage-activated delayed-rectifier type outward currents. Their kinetics and conductance-voltage relationship were different from those mediated by homomultimeric Kv2.1 channels. Yeast two-hybrid reporter assays indicated that Kv6.2 amino-termini are able to interact specifically with the Kv2.1 amino-terminus. It is proposed that this protein protein interaction underlies Kv2.1/Kv6.2 subunit assembly and the expression of functional heteromultimeric Kv2.1/Kv6.2 channels. The most resiliant\nSTATEMENT Mutations in a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit, KV8.2, underlie a blinding inherited photoreceptor dystrophy, indicating an important role for these channels in human vision. Here, we have defined the localization and subunit interactions of KV8.2 channels in primate photoreceptors. We show that the KV8.2 subunit interacts with different Kv2 channels in rods and cones, giving rise to potassium currents with distinct functional properties. Our results provide a molecular basis for retinal dysfunction in patients with mutations in the KCNV2 gene encoding KV8.2. Mining Protein Evolution for Insights into Mechanisms of Voltage-Dependent Sodium Channel Auxiliary Subunits. Voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) beta (\u03b2) subunits have been called the \"overachieving\" auxiliary ion channel subunit. Indeed, these subunits regulate the trafficking of the sodium channel complex at the plasma membrane and simultaneously tune the voltage-dependent properties of the pore-forming alpha-subunit. It is now known that VGSC \u03b2-subunits are capable of similar modulation of\nlink between voltage-gated calcium channel activity and the cell endocytic machinery. Gating and Regulation of KCNQ1 and KCNQ1 + KCNE1 Channel Complexes. The IKs channel complex is formed by the co-assembly of Kv7.1 (KCNQ1), a voltage-gated potassium channel, with its \u03b2-subunit, KCNE1 and the association of numerous accessory regulatory molecules such as PIP2, calmodulin, and yotiao. As a result, the IKs potassium current shows kinetic and regulatory flexibility, which not only allows IKs to fulfill physiological roles as disparate as cardiac repolarization and the maintenance of endolymph K+ homeostasis, but also to cause significant disease when it malfunctions. Here, we review new areas of understanding in the assembly, kinetics of activation and inactivation, voltage-sensor pore coupling, unitary events and regulation of this important ion channel complex, all of which have been given further impetus by the recent solution of cryo-EM structural representations of KCNQ1 alone and KCNQ1+KCNE3. Recently, the stoichiometric\nchannels and illustrated their role during brain development and reproduction. These functions of potassium channels are discussed in this review in the context of regulatory interactions between electrically-active and regulatory subunits. Heteromeric KV2/KV8.2 Channels Mediate Delayed Rectifier Potassium Currents in Primate Photoreceptors. Silent voltage-gated potassium channel subunits (KVS) interact selectively with members of the KV2 channel family to modify their functional properties. The localization and functional roles of these silent subunits remain poorly understood. Mutations in the KVS subunit, KV8.2 (KCNV2), lead to severe visual impairment in humans, but the basis of these deficits remains unclear. Here, we examined the localization, native interactions, and functional properties of KV8.2-containing channels in mouse, macaque, and human photoreceptors of either sex. In human retina, KV8.2 colocalized with KV2.1 and KV2.2 in cone inner segments and with KV2.1 in rod inner segments. KV2.1 and KV2.2 could be coimmunoprecipitated with KV8.2 in retinal lysates indicating\nmessenger pathways and Kv channels. A yeast screen for active Kir3.2 channels subjected to random mutagenesis has identified residues in the transmembrane segments that are crucial for controlling the opening of Kir3.2 channels. The identification of structural elements involved in potassium channel gating in these systems highlights principles that may be important in the regulation of other types of channels. KCNE4 suppresses Kv1.3 currents by modulating trafficking, surface expression and channel gating. Voltage-dependent potassium channels (Kv) play a crucial role in the activation and proliferation of leukocytes. Kv channels are either homo- or hetero-oligomers. This composition modulates their surface expression and serves as a mechanism for regulating channel activity. Kv channel interaction with accessory subunits provides mechanisms for channels to respond to stimuli beyond changes in membrane potential. Here, we demonstrate that KCNE4 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E member 4), but not KCNE2, functions as an inhibitory Kv1.3 partner in\noocytes expressing the alpha1-subunit reduces the number of channels in the plasma membrane. This effect is reverted by coexpressing alpha1 with a dominant-negative mutant of dynamin, a GTPase involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis. Full-length beta-subunit also down-regulates voltage-gated calcium channels but only when lacking the alpha-interaction domain. Moreover, isolated Src homology 3 domain and the full-length beta-subunit were found to interact in vitro with dynamin and to internalize the distantly related Shaker potassium channel. These results demonstrate that the beta-subunit regulates the turnover of voltage-gated calcium channels and other proteins in the cell membrane. This effect is mediated by dynamin and depends on the association state of the beta-subunit to the alpha1-pore-forming subunit. Our findings define a novel function for the beta-subunit through its Src homology 3 domain and establish a link between voltage-gated calcium channel activity and the cell endocytic machinery. Gating and Regulation of KCNQ1 and KCNQ1 + KCNE1\nintact S4-to-gate coupling is present. Further, we show that a triple mutation in the middle of the transmembrane (TM) segment of KCNE3 introduces KCNE1-like effects on the second S4 movement and the gate. In addition, we show that differences in two residues at the external end of the KCNE TM segments underlie differences in the effects of the different KCNEs on the first S4 movement and the voltage sensor-to-gate coupling. KCNE1 and KCNE2 provide a checkpoint governing voltage-gated potassium channel \u03b1-subunit composition. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) currents generated by N-type \u03b1-subunit homotetramers inactivate rapidly because an N-terminal ball domain blocks the channel pore after activation. Hence, the inactivation rate of heterotetrameric channels comprising both N-type and non-N-type (delayed rectifier) \u03b1-subunits depends upon the number of N-type \u03b1-subunits in the complex. As Kv channel inactivation and inactivation recovery rates regulate cellular excitability, the composition and expression of these heterotetrameric complexes are expected\nhere that the cytoplasmic NH2-terminal domains of Kv1, Kv2, Kv3, and Kv4 subfamilies each associate to form homomultimers. Using the yeast two-hybrid system and eight K+ channel genes, two genes (one isolated from rat and one from Drosophila) from each subfamily, we demonstrated that the associations to form heteromultimers by the NH2-terminal domains are strictly subfamily-specific. These subfamily-specific associations suggest a molecular basis for the selective formation of heteromultimeric channels in vivo. Structural determinants of the regulation of the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv2.1 by the modulatory \u03b1-subunit Kv9.3. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels containing alpha-subunits of the Kv2 subfamily mediate delayed rectifier currents in excitable cells. Channels formed by Kv2.1 alpha-subunits inactivate from open- and closed states with both forms of inactivation serving different physiological functions. Here we show that open- and closed-state inactivation of Kv2.1 can be distinguished by the sensitivity to intracellular tetraethylammonium and extracellular potassium and lead to\ndisease, most frequently a reduction. This electrical remodelling may also be important for novel antiarrhythmic therapeutic strategies. The recent crystallization of a 2Tm-1P channel enhances the outlook for more refined molecular approaches. The Role of S4 Charges in Voltage-dependent and Voltage-independent KCNQ1 Potassium Channel Complexes Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels extend their functional repertoire by coassembling with MinK-related peptides (MiRPs). MinK slows the activation of channels formed with KCNQ1 \u03b1 subunits to generate the voltage-dependent IKs channel in human heart; MiRP1 and MiRP2 remove the voltage dependence of KCNQ1 to generate potassium \u201cleak\u201d currents in gastrointestinal epithelia. Other Kv \u03b1 subunits interact with MiRP1 and MiRP2 but without loss of voltage dependence; the mechanism for this disparity is unknown. Here, sequence alignments revealed that the voltage-sensing S4 domain of KCNQ1 bears lower net charge (+3) than that of any other eukaryotic voltage-gated ion channel. We therefore examined the role of KCNQ1\nKv channel inactivation and inactivation recovery rates regulate cellular excitability, the composition and expression of these heterotetrameric complexes are expected to be tightly regulated. In a companion article, we showed that the single transmembrane segment ancillary (\u03b2) subunits KCNE1 and KCNE2 suppress currents generated by homomeric Kv1.4, Kv3.3, and Kv3.4 channels, by trapping them early in the secretory pathway. Here, we show that this trapping is prevented by coassembly of the N-type \u03b1-subunits with intra-subfamily delayed rectifier \u03b1-subunits. Extra-subfamily delayed rectifier \u03b1-subunits, regardless of their capacity to interact with KCNE1 and KCNE2, cannot rescue Kv1.4 or Kv3.4 surface expression unless engineered to interact with them using N-terminal A and B domain swapping. The KCNE1/2-enforced checkpoint ensures N-type \u03b1-subunits only reach the cell surface as part of intra-subfamily mixed-\u03b1 complexes, thereby governing channel composition, inactivation rate, and-by extension-cellular excitability. Structural and functional characterization of Kv6.2 a new gamma-subunit of voltage-gated potassium\nopening and closing in response to membrane-potential changes. These effects can be strongly modulated by cytoplasmic factors such as kinases, phosphatases, and small GTPases. A Kv alpha subunit contains six transmembrane segments, including an intrinsic voltage sensor. In contrast, inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels have just two transmembrane segments in each of its four pore-lining alpha subunits. A variety of intracellular second messengers mediate transmitter and metabolic regulation of Kir channels. For example, Kir3 (GIRK) channels open on binding to the G protein betagamma subunits, thereby mediating slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in the brain. Our structure-based functional analysis on the cytoplasmic N-terminal tetramerization domain T1 of the voltage-gated channel, Kv1.2, uncovered a new function for this domain, modulation of voltage gating, and suggested a possible means of communication between second messenger pathways and Kv channels. A yeast screen for active Kir3.2 channels subjected to random mutagenesis has identified residues in\nresolving the complexities of the Kv channel complexes that repolarize the human ventricular myocardium. Assembly of voltage-gated potassium channels. Conserved hydrophilic motifs determine subfamily-specific interactions between the alpha-subunits. Voltage-gated potassium (K+) channels are assembled by four identical or homologous alpha-subunits to form a tetrameric complex with a central conduction pore for potassium ions. Most of the cloned genes for the alpha-subunits are classified into four subfamilies: Kv1 (Shaker), Kv2 (Shab), Kv3 (Shaw), and Kv4 (Shal). Subfamily-specific assembly of heteromeric K+ channel complexes has been observed in vitro and in vivo, which contributes to the diversity of K+ currents. However, the molecular codes that mediate the subfamily-specific association remain unknown. To understand the molecular basis of the subfamily-specific assembly, we tested the protein-protein interactions of different regions of alpha-subunits. We report here that the cytoplasmic NH2-terminal domains of Kv1, Kv2, Kv3, and Kv4 subfamilies each associate to form homomultimers. Using the\nKv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels in developmental perspective. Kv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels consist of two types of \u03b1-subunits: (a) electrically-active Kcnb1 \u03b1-subunits and (b) silent or modulatory \u03b1-subunits plus \u03b2-subunits that, similar to silent \u03b1-subunits, also regulate electrically-active subunits. Voltage-gated potassium channels were traditionally viewed, mainly by electrophysiologists, as regulators of the electrical activity of the plasma membrane in excitable cells, a role that is performed by transmembrane protein domains of \u03b1-subunits that form the electric pore. Genetic studies revealed a role for this region of \u03b1-subunits of voltage-gated potassium channels in human neurodevelopmental disorders, such as epileptic encephalopathy. The N- and C-terminal domains of \u03b1-subunits interact to form the cytoplasmic subunit of heterotetrameric potassium channels that regulate electric pores. Subsequent animal studies revealed the developmental functions of Kcnb1-containing voltage-gated potassium channels and illustrated their role during brain development and reproduction. These functions of potassium channels are discussed in this review\nthat this protein protein interaction underlies Kv2.1/Kv6.2 subunit assembly and the expression of functional heteromultimeric Kv2.1/Kv6.2 channels. The most resiliant feature of the Kv2.1/Kv6.2 channels was their submicromolar sensitivity to the antiarrhythmic drug propafenone. The data suggest that delayed-rectifier type channels containing Kv6.2 subunits may contribute to cardiac action potential repolarization. Structure and function of cardiac potassium channels. Recent advances in molecular biology have had a major impact on our understanding of the biophysical and molecular properties of ion channels. This review is focused on cardiac potassium channels which, in general, serve to control and limit cardiac excitability. Approximately 60 K+ channel subunits have been cloned to date. The (evolutionary) oldest potassium channel subunits consist of two transmembrane (Tm) segments with an intervening pore-loop (P). Channels formed by four 2Tm-1P subunits generally function as inwardly rectifying K(+)-selective channels (KirX.Y): they conduct substantial current near the resting potential but carry little\nactive MiRP2-KCNQ4 channels. The results demonstrate that the unique S4 charge paucity of KCNQ1 facilitates its unique conversion to a leak channel by ancillary subunits such as MiRP2. INTRODUCTION Voltage-gated ion channels mediate cellular electrical excitability and are thus essential for the action potentials of neurons, myocytes, and all other excitable cells. Voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels permit influx of their respective ions once the threshold voltage for their activation is attained. This influx of positive ions depolarizes the cell further, activating voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels to allow efflux of K+ ions, repolarizing the cell, and ending the action potential. All voltage-gated cation channels contain four voltage-sensing S4 domains (membrane-spanning \u03b1 helices bearing basic residues) that confer voltage sensitivity. Upon cellular depolarization, S4 undergoes a conformational and/or positional change to the \u201con\u201d position, which is communicated to the channel gate, opening the channel. The exact nature of the movement that\npermitting KCNQ1 to act either as a constitutively open pore or a voltage-dependent channel in contexts dictated by overlapping expression of specific ancillary subunits, facilitating multiple prominent and diverse roles in mammalian physiology. Supplemental Material Impact of ancillary subunits on ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels generate the outward K(+) ion currents that constitute the primary force in ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium channels comprise tetramers of pore-forming alpha subunits and, in probably most cases in vivo, ancillary or beta subunits that help define the properties of the Kv current generated. Ancillary subunits can be broadly categorized as cytoplasmic or transmembrane and can modify Kv channel trafficking, conductance, gating, ion selectivity, regulation, and pharmacology. Because of their often profound effects on Kv channel function, studies of the molecular correlates of ventricular repolarization must take into account ancillary subunits as well as alpha subunits. Cytoplasmic ancillary subunits include the Kv beta subunits,\nsegments and with KV2.1 in rod inner segments. KV2.1 and KV2.2 could be coimmunoprecipitated with KV8.2 in retinal lysates indicating that these subunits likely interact directly. Retinal KV2.1 was less phosphorylated than cortical KV2.1, a difference expected to alter the biophysical properties of these channels. Using voltage-clamp recordings and pharmacology, we provide functional evidence for Kv2-containing channels in primate rods and cones. We propose that the presence of KV8.2, and low levels of KV2.1 phosphorylation shift the activation range of KV2 channels to align with the operating range of rod and cone photoreceptors. Our data indicate a role for KV2/KV8.2 channels in human photoreceptor function and suggest that the visual deficits in patients with KCNV2 mutations arise from inadequate resting activation of KV channels in rod and cone inner segments.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Mutations in a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit, KV8.2, underlie a blinding inherited photoreceptor dystrophy, indicating an important role for\ninteraction with S338 in the KCNQ1 S6 domain, placing MiRP2 close to the KCNQ1 channel pore. Furthermore, swapping of this central residue of the \u201cactivation triplet\u201d within the transmembrane domain between MinK and MiRP2 bestows the activation properties of either subunit on complexes formed with KCNQ1; T58V-MinK/KCNQ1 complexes exhibit a degree of constitutive activation, whereas V72T-MiRP2-KCNQ1 complexes produce slowly activating currents. These data do not, however, explain why other voltage-gated potassium channels are not similarly affected by coassembly with MiRP2. KCNQ4 also bears a serine at a position equivalent to KCNQ1-S338 in the S6 but is inhibited by MiRP2. Significantly, the activation of Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 is slowed by both MinK and MiRP2 with minimal changes in voltage dependence, suggesting that the contrasting effects of MinK and MiRP2 are relatively specific to KCNQ1. Further, the voltage dependence of Kv3.4 activation is negatively shifted by MiRP2 but without adoption of constitutive\nthe \u201con\u201d position, which is communicated to the channel gate, opening the channel. The exact nature of the movement that S4 undergoes when switching from the \u201coff\u201d to the \u201con\u201d position is a matter of intense debate, with some arguing for a comprehensive shift from the intracellular to the extracellular side of the plasma membrane, while others contend the conformational shift is far more subtle. The KCNQ subfamily of Kv channel \u03b1 subunits contains five known members, KCNQ1\u20135. While KCNQ2\u20135 are neuronally expressed and contribute to the M-current, KCNQ1 is expressed in the heart, gastrointestinal epithelia, and inner ear, but not the brain. MiRPs (MinK-related peptides), encoded by KCNE genes, are single transmembrane domain ancillary subunits that coassemble with a wide array of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels and hyperpolarization-activated, cation-nonselective (HCN) channels to alter their gating, conductance, regulation, and pharmacology. KCNQ1 is unique among voltage-gated ion channels in that it\nmode by MiRP1 and MiRP2 poses several questions, three of which we address here: how can a channel with a voltage sensor lose voltage dependence; is the KCNQ1 activation gate uncoupled from S4 in leak channels; and why do MiRP1 and MiRP2 not convert any of their many other potassium channel partners to leak channels? MiRPs exhibit promiscuity of interaction; each can associate with a number of different \u03b1 subunit partners. Furthermore, each MiRP exerts a range of functional effects depending upon the \u03b1 subunit, thus \u03b1 subunit sequence differences must be an important determinant of functional outcome. Previous studies have identified MiRP sequence motifs important in determining specific gating effects, but \u03b1 subunit sequence motifs determining \u03b1 subunit\u2013specific gating effects have not previously been determined. Here, the results of alanine-scanning mutagenesis in KCNQ1 and reciprocal mutagenesis between KCNQ1 and KCNQ4 demonstrate that the charge paucity of the CO2H half",

Adaptation to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress depends on the activation of the sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1\u03b1 (IRE1), an endoribonuclease that splices the mRNA of the transcription factor XBP1 (X-box-binding protein 1). To better understand the protein network that regulates the activity of the IRE1 pathway, we systematically screened the proteins that interact with IRE1 and identified a ribonuclease inhibitor called ribonuclease/angiogenin inhibitor 1 (RNH1). RNH1 is a leucine-rich repeat domains-containing protein that binds to and inhibits ribonucleases. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed this interaction. Docking experiments indicated that RNH1 physically interacts with IRE1 through its cytosolic RNase domain. Upon ER stress, the interaction of RNH1 with IRE1 in the ER increased at the expense of the nuclear pool of RNH1. Inhibition of RNH1 expression using siRNA mediated RNA interference upon ER stress led to an increased splicing activity of\nand are not mediated by direct or triangulated contacts, are proposed. These findings show that the basis for the generation of hot spots can be complex, and that these sites can assume significantly more (as with Ang) or less (as with RNase) importance than indicated from the effects of single-site mutations. Ribonuclease/angiogenin inhibitor 1 regulates stress-induced subcellular localization of angiogenin to control growth and survival. Angiogenin (ANG) promotes cell growth and survival. Under growth conditions, ANG undergoes nuclear translocation and accumulates in the nucleolus where it stimulates rRNA transcription. When cells are stressed, ANG mediates the production of tRNA-derived stress-induced small RNA (tiRNA), which reprograms protein translation into a survival mechanism. The ribonucleolytic activity of ANG is essential for both processes but how this activity is regulated is unknown. We report here that ribonuclease/angiogenin inhibitor 1 (RNH1) controls both the localization and activity of ANG. Under growth conditions, ANG is\nactivity. Here we report a crystal structure of ARH-I that reveals the molecular basis for these characteristics. The ribonuclease A-derived (guest) segment adopts a structure largely similar to that in ribonuclease A, and successfully converts this region from a cell-binding site to a purine-binding site. At the same time, its presence causes complex changes in the angiogenin-derived (host) portion that account for much of the increased ribonuclease activity of ARH-I. Guest-host interactions of this type probably occur more generally in protein chimeras, emphasizing the importance of direct structural information for understanding the functional behavior of such molecules. Analysis of the interactions of human ribonuclease inhibitor with angiogenin and ribonuclease A by mutagenesis: importance of inhibitor residues inside versus outside the C-terminal \"hot spot\". Ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) binds diverse mammalian RNases with extraordinary avidity. Here, we have investigated the structural basis for this tight binding and broad specificity by mutational analysis\nAngiogenin/Ribonuclease 5 Is an EGFR Ligand and a Serum Biomarker for Erlotinib Sensitivity in Pancreatic Cancer. Pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase) is a secreted enzyme critical for host defense. We discover an intrinsic RNase function, serving as a ligand for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a member of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The closely related bovine RNase A and human RNase 5 (angiogenin [ANG]) can trigger oncogenic transformation independently of their catalytic activities via direct association with EGFR. Notably, high plasma ANG level in PDAC patients is positively associated with response to EGFR inhibitor erlotinib treatment. These results identify a role of ANG as a serum biomarker that may be used to stratify patients for EGFR-targeted therapies, and offer insights into the ligand-receptor relationship between RNase and RTK families. Ribonuclease inhibitor 1 regulates erythropoiesis by controlling GATA1 translation. Ribosomal proteins (RP) regulate specific gene expression by selectively\ngrowth, ANG must be transported to the nucleus and must retain its catalytic activity. Like other mammalian homologues of RNase A, ANG forms a femtomolar complex with the cytosolic ribonuclease inhibitor protein (RI). To determine whether RI affects ANG-induced angiogenesis, we created G85R/G86R ANG, which possesses 10(6)-fold lower affinity for RI but retains wild-type ribonucleolytic activity. The neovascularization of rabbit corneas by G85R/G86R ANG was more pronounced and more rapid than by wild-type ANG. These findings provide the first direct evidence that RI serves to regulate the biological activity of ANG in vivo. Superadditive and subadditive effects of \"hot spot\" mutations within the interfaces of placental ribonuclease inhibitor with angiogenin and ribonuclease A. Previous single-site mutagenesis studies on the complexes of ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) with angiogenin (Ang) and RNase A suggested that in both cases a substantial fraction of the binding energy is concentrated within one small part of the\nreport here that ribonuclease/angiogenin inhibitor 1 (RNH1) controls both the localization and activity of ANG. Under growth conditions, ANG is located in the nucleus and is not associated with RNH1 so that the ribonucleolytic activity is retained to ensure rRNA transcription. Cytoplasmic ANG is associated with and inhibited by RNH1 so that random cleavage of cellular RNA is prevented. Under stress conditions, ANG is localized to the cytoplasm and is concentrated in stress granules where it is not associated with RNH1 and thus remains enzymatically active for tiRNA production. By contrast, nuclear ANG is associated with RNH1 in stressed cells to ensure that the enzymatic activity is inhibited and no unnecessary rRNA is produced to save anabolic energy. Knockdown of RNH1 abolished stress-induced relocalization of ANG and decreased cell growth and survival. Regulation of IRE1 RNase activity by the Ribonuclease inhibitor 1 (RNH1). Adaptation to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress depends\nincluding ANG His37Ala mutant obviously decreased RI expression and activated phosphorylation of key downstream target molecules of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Finally, up-regulating ANG led to the promotion of tumor angiogenesis, tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo. Taken together, our data provided a novel mechanism of ANG in regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway via RI, which suggested a new therapeutic target for cancer therapy. Ribonuclease inhibitor up-regulation inhibits the growth and induces apoptosis in murine melanoma cells through repression of angiogenin and ILK/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Human ribonuclease inhibitor (RI), a cytoplasmic protein, is constructed almost entirely of leucine rich repeats. RI could suppress activities of ribonuclease and angiogenin (ANG) through closely combining with them. ANG is a potent inducer of blood vessel growth and has been implicated in the establishment, growth, and metastasis of tumors. ILK/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway also plays important roles in cell growth, cell-cycle progression, tumor angiogenesis, and cell apoptosis. Our\nGGRRmut compensates the effects of the latter. Our results explain the in vitro finding that, while Ang GGRRmut -based hCFPs resist RNH1 inhibition remarkably, Ang WT- and Ang QGmut -based ones are similarly sensitive to RNH1 inhibition, whereas Ang GGRR/QGmut -based ones are only slightly resistant. This work may help design novel Ang mutants with reduced affinity for RNH1 and improved cytotoxicity. Angiogenin (ANG)-Ribonuclease Inhibitor (RNH1) System in Protein Synthesis and Disease. Protein synthesis is a highly complex process executed by well-organized translation machinery. Ribosomes, tRNAs and mRNAs are the principal components of this machinery whereas RNA binding proteins and ribosome interacting partners act as accessory factors. Angiogenin (ANG)-Ribonuclease inhibitor (RNH1) system is one such accessory part of the translation machinery that came into focus afresh due to its unconventional role in the translation. ANG is conventionally known for its ability to induce blood vessel formation and RNH1 as a\nRTK families. Ribonuclease inhibitor 1 regulates erythropoiesis by controlling GATA1 translation. Ribosomal proteins (RP) regulate specific gene expression by selectively translating subsets of mRNAs. Indeed, in Diamond-Blackfan anemia and 5q- syndrome, mutations in RP genes lead to a specific defect in erythroid gene translation and cause anemia. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms of selective mRNA translation and involvement of ribosomal-associated factors in this process. Ribonuclease inhibitor 1 (RNH1) is a ubiquitously expressed protein that binds to and inhibits pancreatic-type ribonucleases. Here, we report that RNH1 binds to ribosomes and regulates erythropoiesis by controlling translation of the erythroid transcription factor GATA1. Rnh1-deficient mice die between embryonic days E8.5 and E10 due to impaired production of mature erythroid cells from progenitor cells. In Rnh1-deficient embryos, mRNA levels of Gata1 are normal, but GATA1 protein levels are decreased. At the molecular level, we found that RNH1 binds to the 40S subunit\nproliferation, regulate cell cycle and induce apoptosis. Furthermore, up-regulation of RI inhibited phosphorylation of ILK downstream signaling targets protein kinase B/Akt, glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK-3\u03b2), and reduced \u03b2-catenin expression in vivo and vitro. More importantly, RI significant inhibited the tumor growth and angiogenesis of tumor bearing C57BL/6 mice. In conclusion, our findings, for the first time, suggest that angiogenin and ILK signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in mediating the inhibitory effects of RI on melanoma cells growth. This study identifies that RI may be a useful molecular target for melanoma therapy. Ribonuclease inhibitor regulates neovascularization by human angiogenin. Human angiogenin (ANG) is a homologue of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase A) that induces neovascularization. ANG is the only human angiogenic factor that possesses ribonucleolytic activity. To stimulate blood vessel growth, ANG must be transported to the nucleus and must retain its catalytic activity. Like other mammalian homologues of RNase\nof RNase A is more sensitive to substitutions throughout the interface, with free energy losses>/=1 kcal/mol produced by nearly all replacements examined, so that the sum of losses greatly exceeds the binding energy of the complex. This discrepancy can be explained, in part, by positive cooperativity, as evident from the subadditive effects observed when combinations of residues in either the hot spot or Trp-rich region are replaced. These findings suggest that the binding energy may be more widely distributed in the RNase A complex than in the Ang complex. Angiogenin interacts with ribonuclease inhibitor regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in bladder cancer cells. Angiogenin (ANG), a member of RNase A superfamily, is the only angiogenic factor that possesses ribonucleolytic activity. Recent studies showed that the expression of ANG was elevated in various types of cancers. Accumulating evidence indicates that ANG plays an essential role in cancer progression by stimulating both cancer\nmoiety (e.g., an antibody or a fragment thereof) fused to a human proapoptotic protein as the cytotoxic domain (effector domain). Therefore, hCFPs are humanized ITs expected to have low immunogenicity. This reduces side effects and allows long-term application. The human ribonuclease angiogenin (Ang) has been shown to be a promising effector domain candidate. However, the application of Ang-based hCFPs is largely hampered by the intracellular placental ribonuclease inhibitor (RNH1). It rapidly binds and inactivates Ang. Mutations altering Ang's affinity for RNH1 modulate the cytotoxicity of Ang-based hCFPs. Here we perform in total 2.7 \u00b5s replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations to investigate some of these mutations-G85R/G86R (GGRRmut ), Q117G (QGmut ), and G85R/G86R/Q117G (GGRR/QGmut ). GGRRmut turns out to perturb greatly the overall Ang-RNH1 interactions, whereas QGmut optimizes them. Combining QGmut with GGRRmut compensates the effects of the latter. Our results explain the in vitro finding that, while Ang GGRRmut -based hCFPs\nRNH1. Inhibition of RNH1 expression using siRNA mediated RNA interference upon ER stress led to an increased splicing activity of XBP1. Modulation of IRE1 RNase activity by RNH1 was recapitulated in a cell-free system, suggesting direct regulation of IRE1 by RNH. We conclude that RNH1 attenuates the activity of IRE1 by interacting with its ribonuclease domain. These findings have implications for understanding the molecular mechanism by which IRE1 signaling is attenuated upon ER stress. An endogenous ribonuclease inhibitor regulates the antimicrobial activity of ribonuclease 7 in the human urinary tract. Recent studies stress the importance of antimicrobial peptides in protecting the urinary tract from infection. Previously, we have shown that ribonuclease 7 (RNase 7) is a potent antimicrobial peptide that has a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against uropathogenic bacteria. The urothelium of the lower urinary tract and intercalated cells of the kidney produce RNase 7, but regulation of its antimicrobial activity\nnormal, but GATA1 protein levels are decreased. At the molecular level, we found that RNH1 binds to the 40S subunit of ribosomes and facilitates polysome formation on Gata1 mRNA to confer transcript-specific translation. Further, RNH1 knockdown in human CD34+ progenitor cells decreased erythroid differentiation without affecting myelopoiesis. Our results reveal an unsuspected role for RNH1 in the control of GATA1 mRNA translation and erythropoiesis. Guest-host crosstalk in an angiogenin-RNase A chimeric protein. Angiogenin and ribonuclease A share 33% sequence identity but have distinct functions. Angiogenin is a potent inducer of angiogenesis that is only weakly ribonucleolytic, whereas ribonuclease A is a robust ribonuclease that is not angiogenic. A chimera (\"ARH-I\"), in which angiogenin residues 58-70 are replaced with residues 59-73 of ribonuclease A, has intermediate ribonucleolytic potency and no angiogenic activity. Here we report a crystal structure of ARH-I that reveals the molecular basis for these characteristics. The ribonuclease A-derived\nvarious types of cancers. Accumulating evidence indicates that ANG plays an essential role in cancer progression by stimulating both cancer cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. Human ribonuclease inhibitor (RI), a cytoplasmic protein, is constructed almost entirely of leucine rich repeats (LRRs), which are present in a large family of proteins that are distinguished by their display of vast surface areas to foster protein-protein interactions. RI might be involved in unknown biological effects except inhibiting RNase A activity. The experiment demonstrated that RI also could suppress activity of angiogenin (ANG) through closely combining with it in vitro. PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway exerts a key role in cell growth, survival, proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis. We recently reported that up-regulating RI inhibited the growth and induced apoptosis of murine melanoma cells through repression of angiogenin and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. However, ANG receptors have not yet been identified to date, its related signal transduction pathways\nmonitor pri-miR-21 processing, we demonstrated that RNH1 is necessary and sufficient for pri-miR-21 processing. Moreover, our results propose that the nuclear localization of RNH1 is important for this function. Further analysis showed that RNH1 directly interacts with the Drosha complex and that PTEN blocks this interaction. Taken together, these results suggest that the PTEN-mediated miR-21 regulation is achieved by inhibiting the interaction between the Drosha complex and RNH1, revealing previously unidentified role of PTEN in the oncogenic miR-21 biogenesis. Engineered human angiogenin mutations in the placental ribonuclease inhibitor complex for anticancer therapy: Insights from enhanced sampling simulations. Targeted human cytolytic fusion proteins (hCFPs) represent a new generation of immunotoxins (ITs) for the specific targeting and elimination of malignant cell populations. Unlike conventional ITs, hCFPs comprise a human/humanized target cell-specific binding moiety (e.g., an antibody or a fragment thereof) fused to a human proapoptotic protein as the cytotoxic domain (effector domain).\nof the lower urinary tract and intercalated cells of the kidney produce RNase 7, but regulation of its antimicrobial activity has not been well defined. Here, we characterize the expression of an endogenous inhibitor, ribonuclease inhibitor (RI), in the urinary tract and evaluate its effect on the antimicrobial activity of RNase 7. Using RNA isolated from non-infected human bladder and kidney tissue, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that RNH1, the gene encoding RI, is constitutively expressed throughout the urinary tract. With pyelonephritis, RNH1 expression and RI peptide production significantly decrease. Immunostaining localized RI production to the umbrella cells of the bladder and intercalated cells of the renal collecting tubule. In vitro assays showed that RI bound to RNase 7 and suppressed its antimicrobial activity by blocking its ability to bind the cell wall of uropathogenic bacteria. Thus, these results demonstrate a new immunomodulatory role for RI and identified a\nlosses in binding energy for the RNase complex associated with replacements of Tyr434 and Asp435, and Tyr434 and Tyr437, are markedly less than additive (i.e., by 2.4 and 1.3 kcal/mol, respectively). In contrast, the energetic effects of the 434 and 435, and 434 and 437, substitution pairs on binding of Ang are fully additive and 2.5 kcal/mol beyond additive, respectively. Superadditivities (0.9-2.4 kcal/mol) are also observed for several multisite replacements involving these inhibitor residues and two Ang residues, Arg5 and Lys40, from this part of the interface. Consequently, the decreases in binding energy for some triple-variant complexes are as large as 8.5-10.1 kcal/mol (compared to a total DeltaG of -21.0 kcal/mol for the wild-type complex). Potential explanations for these functional couplings, many of which occur over distances of >13 A and are not mediated by direct or triangulated contacts, are proposed. These findings show that the basis for the generation\narea of RI, containing Trp261, Trp263, Trp318, and Trp375. Although the energy losses from individual replacements in this portion of the Ang complex were small-to-moderate (0-1.5 kcal/mol), the changes from multiple substitutions were much greater than additive, and the binding energy provided by this region is estimated to be approximately 6 kcal/mol (30 % of total). Effects of replacing combinations of hot spot components had also been found to be superadditive, and this negative cooperativity is now shown to extend to the neighboring contact residue RI Ser460. The overall contribution of the hot spot, taking superadditivity into account, is then approximately 14-15 kcal/mol. The hot spot and Trp-rich regions, although spatially well separated, are themselves functionally linked. No other parts of the RI-Ang interface appear to be energetically important. Binding of RNase A is more sensitive to substitutions throughout the interface, with free energy losses>/=1 kcal/mol produced by nearly all\nangiogenin and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. However, ANG receptors have not yet been identified to date, its related signal transduction pathways are not fully clear and underlying interacting mechanisms between RI and ANG remain largely unknown. Therefore, we hypothesize that RI might combine with intracellular ANG to block its nuclear translocation and regulate PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway to inhibit biological functions of ANG. Here, we reported for the first time that ANG could interact with RI endogenously and exogenously by using co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and GST pull-down. Furthermore, we observed the colocalization of ANG and RI in cells with immunofluorescence staining under laser confocal microscope. Moreover, through fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, we further confirmed that these two proteins have a physical interaction in living cells. Subsequently, we demonstrated that up-regulating ANG including ANG His37Ala mutant obviously decreased RI expression and activated phosphorylation of key downstream target molecules of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.",

Here we assess the role of these \"outsider\" proteins in influenza virus hemagglutinin-mediated fusion between red blood cells and either hemagglutinin-expressing cells or viral particles. To selectively inhibit or enhance the actions of hemagglutinin outsiders, the antibodies that bind to hemagglutinin and proteases that cleave it were conjugated to polystyrene microspheres too large to enter the contact zone. We also involved hemagglutinin outsiders into interactions with additional red blood cells. We find the hemagglutinin outsiders to be necessary and sufficient for fusion. Interfering with\ninteractions with additional red blood cells. We find the hemagglutinin outsiders to be necessary and sufficient for fusion. Interfering with the activity of the hemagglutinin outsiders inhibited fusion. Selective conversion of hemagglutinin outsiders alone into fusion-competent conformation was sufficient to achieve fusion. The discovered functional role of fusion proteins located outside of the contact zone suggests a tempting analogy to mechanisms by which proteins mediate membrane fission from outside of the fission site. Functional network of glycan-related molecules: glyco-net in glycoconjugate data bank. BACKGROUND: Glycans are involved in a wide range of biological process, and they play an essential role in functions such as cell differentiation, cell adhesion, pathogen-host recognition, toxin-receptor interactions, signal transduction, cancer metastasis, and immune responses. Elucidating pathways related to post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as glycosylation are of growing importance in post-genome science and technology. Graphical networks describing the relationships among glycan-related molecules, including genes, proteins, lipids\nSpatial Screening of Hemagglutinin on Influenza A Virus Particles: Sialyl-LacNAc Displays on DNA and PEG Scaffolds Reveal the Requirements for Bivalency Enhanced Interactions with Weak Monovalent Binders. Attachment of the Influenza A virus onto host cells involves multivalent interactions between virus surface hemagglutinin (HA) and sialoside-containing glyco ligands. Despite the development of extremely powerful multivalent binders of the Influenza virus and other viruses, comparably little is known about the optimal spacing of HA ligands, which ought to bridge binding sites within or across the trimeric HA molecules. To explore the criteria for ligand economical high affinity binding, we systematically probed distance-affinity relationships by means of two differently behaving scaffold types based on (i) flexible polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugates and (ii) rigid self-assembled DNA\u00b7PNA complexes. The bivalent scaffolds presented two sialyl-LacNAc ligands in 23-101 \u00c5 distance. A combined analysis of binding by means of microscale thermophoresis measurements and statistical mechanics models\nselective binding. We postulated that discrete synthetic glycomacromolecules with precise absolute configurations could bind lectins with higher and/or tunable selectivity. Our hypothesis is rooted in the knowledge that the distances and orientations between glycan-binding sites on oligomeric lectins are defined. Currently, the synthesis of molecularly defined synthetic and natural glycomacromolecules is challenging, precluding facile exploration of structure-selectivity space. There are no readily accessible biological expression systems or amplification methods that can produce appreciable quantities of pure glycans with systematic structural variations. Synthetic glycomacromolecules, on the other hand, can be synthesized readily using statistical polymerization methods and postpolymerization modification.\u2212 Such glycomacromolecules can block hemagglutinin on influenza A,\u2212 inhibit HIV binding to DC-SIGN on dendritic cells,\u2212 or trigger immunological responses for vaccine development.\u2212 Though these systems are valuable, they are generated using stochastic processes that lack precise control over stereochemistry, length, and sugar epitope density.

A combined analysis of binding by means of microscale thermophoresis measurements and statistical mechanics models exposed the inherent limitations of PEG-based spacers. Given the distance requirements of HA, the flexibility of PEG scaffolds is too high to raise the effective concentration of glyco ligands above a value that allows interactions with the low affinity binding site. By contrast, spatial screening with less flexible, self-assembled peptide nucleic acid (PNA)\u00b7DNA complexes uncovered a well-defined and, surprisingly, bimodal distance-affinity relationship for interactions of the Influenza A virus HA with bivalent displays of the natural sialyl-LacNAc ligand. Optimal constructs conferred 103-fold binding enhancements with only two ligands. We discuss the existence of secondary binding sites and shine light on the preference for intramolecular rather than intermolecular recognition of HA trimers on the virus surface. Influenza hemagglutinins outside of the contact zone are necessary for fusion pore expansion. Current models\nof growing importance in post-genome science and technology. Graphical networks describing the relationships among glycan-related molecules, including genes, proteins, lipids and various biological events are considered extremely valuable and convenient tools for the systematic investigation of PTMs. However, there is no database which dynamically draws functional networks related to glycans.DESCRIPTION: We have created a database called Glyco-Net http://www.glycoconjugate.jp/functions/, with many binary relationships among glycan-related molecules. Using search results, we can dynamically draw figures of the functional relationships among these components with nodes and arrows. A certain molecule or event corresponds to a node in the network figures, and the relationship between the molecule and the event are indicated by arrows. Since all components are treated equally, an arrow is also a node.CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we describe our new database, Glyco-Net, which is the first database to dynamically show networks of the functional profiles of glycan related molecules.

Thus, targeting lectins, especially those on the surface of immune cells, could advance immunology and drug discovery. Lectins are typically oligomeric; therefore, many of the most potent ligands are multivalent. An effective strategy for lectin targeting is to display multiple copies of a single glycan epitope on a polymer backbone; however, a drawback to such multivalent ligands is they\nmultiple copies of a single glycan epitope on a polymer backbone; however, a drawback to such multivalent ligands is they cannot distinguish between lectins that share monosaccharide binding selectivity (e.g., mannose-binding lectins) as they often lack molecular precision. Here, we describe the development of an iterative exponential growth (IEG) synthetic strategy that enables facile access to synthetic glycomacromolecules with precisely defined and tunable sizes up to 22.5 kDa, compositions, topologies, and absolute configurations. Twelve discrete mannosylated \u201cglyco-IEGmers\u201d are synthesized and screened for binding to a panel of mannoside-binding immune lectins (DC-SIGN, DC-SIGNR, MBL, SP-D, langerin, dectin-2, mincle, and DEC-205). In many cases, the glyco-IEGmers had distinct length, stereochemistry, and topology-dependent lectin-binding preferences. To understand these differences, we used molecular dynamics and density functional theory simulations of octameric glyco-IEGmers, which revealed dramatic effects of glyco-IEGmer stereochemistry and topology on solution structure and reveal an interplay between conformational diversity and chiral recognition\ndramatic effects of glyco-IEGmer stereochemistry and topology on solution structure and reveal an interplay between conformational diversity and chiral recognition in selective lectin binding. Ligand function also could be controlled by chemical substitution: by tuning the side chains of glyco-IEGmers that bind DC-SIGN, we could alter their cellular trafficking through alteration of their aggregation state. These results highlight the power of precision synthetic oligomer/polymer synthesis for selective biological targeting, motivating the development of next-generation glycomacromolecules tailored for specific immunological or other therapeutic applications. Introduction Since their discovery in 1888, carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) have emerged as vital regulators of biological processes, including cell recognition, signal transduction, and intercellular communication.\u2212 Lectins accomplish these functions by binding glycans (oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, glycolipids, etc.) on the surfaces of cells or viruses.\u2212 Many of these interactions are directly involved in human disease. Thus, there is a great desire for synthetic glycan probes to engage specific lectins\nare directly involved in human disease. Thus, there is a great desire for synthetic glycan probes to engage specific lectins for cell targeting or inhibition. Nevertheless, devising ligands that interact selectively with lectins is challenging. Lectins have evolved to act on target cells, viruses, or glycoproteins through multivalent binding. Accordingly, most lectins are oligomeric. As a result, they typically bind weakly to monovalent glycans; therefore, efforts to generate specific lectin ligands are focused on multivalent glycoconjugates.\u2212 Although multivalent glycans often bind avidly, their ability to distinguish between lectins that bind similar monovalent sugars is limited. Many reports on the design of multivalent ligands rely on statistical polymers, whose epitope density, length, or stereochemistry are not precisely defined. Thus, their presentation of glycan-binding epitopes with different geometries and orientations may preclude selective binding. We postulated that discrete synthetic glycomacromolecules with precise absolute configurations could bind lectins with higher and/or tunable selectivity.\nstochastic processes that lack precise control over stereochemistry, length, and sugar epitope density. Current methods for preparing uniform, synthetic glycomacromolecules are generally based on strategies that are costly to scale; they typically require complex protecting group manipulations, large excesses of reagents, and laborious purifications. Efforts toward synthesizing more well-defined synthetic glycomacromolecules have been reported via solution phase\u2212 and solid-phase methods.\u2212 Nevertheless, given that the scaffold upon which a glycan epitope is presented is critical for activity, general strategies for the scalable, facile synthesis of precise glycomacromolecules are needed. Iterative exponential growth (IEG) offers a powerful strategy for the synthesis of discrete oligomers and polymers with tunable sequences and absolute configurations and good scalability.\u2212 In IEG, orthogonally functionalized (macro)molecules undergo cycles of activation and convergent coupling. IEG has enabled detailed studies of the impact of molecular features on materials, including block copolymer self-assembly, cell uptake, and in vivo biodistribution. We reasoned\nof the impact of molecular features on materials, including block copolymer self-assembly, cell uptake, and in vivo biodistribution. We reasoned that IEG might enable the synthesis of glycomacromolecules that could selectively target distinct lectins and potentially reveal molecular trends related to lectin binding that would be impossible to unveil with stochastic polymers. To this end, our goal here is to introduce a new synthetic platform for precision glycopolymer synthesis that enables absolute control of molecular structure. We leveraged IEG to prepare a set of allyl-functionalized oligo/polymers of varied lengths (8, 16, and 32 allyl side chains), topologies (linear or cyclic), and absolute configurations. Subsequent thiol\u2013ene addition reactions using thiol-mannose provided access to 12 distinct mannosylated \u201cglyco-IEGmers\u201d (Figure 1A, B). Assessment of the binding specificity of these glycomacromolecules toward different mannose-binding lectins revealed structure-dependent binding preferences that would be obscured using traditional statistical polymer mixtures. To the best of our knowledge,\nlectins revealed structure-dependent binding preferences that would be obscured using traditional statistical polymer mixtures. To the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have screened discrete, synthetic glycopolymers in this manner. Our results open the door to the potential identification of new strategies for highly selective targeting of mannose-binding lectins and will motivate the development of next-generation precise glycomacromolecules as therapeutics and tool compounds for glycobiology.

(C) 1H NMR characterization (500 MHz, D2O, 25 \u00b0C, 400 MHz) of diastereomeric mannosylated 8-mer macrocycles. Synthesis and Characterization To generate the target mannosylated glyco-IEGmers, IEG cycles beginning from (R)- or (S)-glycidyl propargyl ether (GPE, > 99% ee) were conducted to yield oligo/polytriazoles with precisely 8, 16, or 32 allyl side chains. Macromolecules were produced with three different overall absolute configurations: all (R) (\u201cisotactic\u201d), all\n8, 16, or 32 allyl side chains. Macromolecules were produced with three different overall absolute configurations: all (R) (\u201cisotactic\u201d), all (S) (\u201cisotactic\u201d), and alternating (R-alt-S) (\u201csyndiotactic\u201d) (Note: absolute configurations are labeled based on the GPE enantiomer used). The three stereoisomeric 8-mers were subsequently cyclized at high dilution to provide macrocyclic isomers of their linear counterparts. To append the mannose residues, we exposed each of these 12 allyl-based oligo/polymers to pure \u03b2-thiomannose sodium salt under UV light (\u03bb = 365 nm), affording the glycoconjugates in quantitative yield. The stereochemistry was preserved, as indicated by the sharp signals in 1H NMR spectra of the glyco-IEGmers (Figure 1C; Figures S23\u201327) and 1D and 2D NMR analyses of a model thiol\u2013ene reaction using \u03b2-thiomannose and allyl alcohol (Figures S10\u201313). 1H NMR analysis of diastereomeric glyco-IEGmers revealed their unique chemical environments. For example, for the isotactic (S)-8-mer macrocycle (Figure 1C), the signals from protons Hi\nglyco-IEGmers revealed their unique chemical environments. For example, for the isotactic (S)-8-mer macrocycle (Figure 1C), the signals from protons Hi and Hj are the narrowest, whereas the corresponding signals from the syndiotactic macrocycle are broader. By contrast, the signals for the same protons of the isotactic (R)-8-mer macrocycle are broader yet (Hi) or split into two distinct multiplets (Hj). Conformational Analysis Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy showed that the chiral secondary structures of the glyco-IEGmers changed with topology, length, stereochemistry, and solution pH (Figure S36). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the linear and macrocyclic 8-mer glyco-IEGmers suggest that they have rich and complex solution structures arising from their topologies and configurations. Few marked differences were seen in the ensemble-average root-mean-squared-deviation, radii of gyration, and numbers of intramolecular hydrogen bonds (Figure 2A\u2013C). However, dynamical analysis of the MD data identifies multiple interconverting long-lived substates for each isomer. (Figure 2D,E; Figures S47\u2013S52). The\nHowever, dynamical analysis of the MD data identifies multiple interconverting long-lived substates for each isomer. (Figure 2D,E; Figures S47\u2013S52). The macrocycles were comparatively more rigid, adopting discrete longer-lived conformational substates with different degrees of backbone looping and twisting. The states of the linear chains have variable degrees of structure and coiling. The R-alt-S isomers typically had more complicated conformational profiles than either the R or S diastereomers. Separate analyses of the backbone and mannose side chain motions (Figures S54\u2013S59) suggest that the long-lasting conformational states are mostly associated with the backbone; the mannose units rapidly fluctuate around their backbone anchor points.

We concluded that KPNA3 knockdown eliminates the second heat shock protein peak in the heat shock response of male silkworm pupae by reducing HSF transport into the nucleus. The Role of Heat Shock Factors in Mammalian Spermatogenesis. Heat shock transcription factors (HSFs), as regulators of heat shock proteins (HSPs) expression, are well known for their cytoprotective functions during cellular stress. They also play important yet less recognized roles in gametogenesis. All HSF family members are expressed during mammalian spermatogenesis, mainly in spermatocytes and round spermatids which are characterized\nthe role of karyopherin alpha 3 in the heat shock response in male silkworm pupae.

Three predicted karyopherin alphas (KPNA1, KPNA2 and KPNA3) have been identified from the silkworm Bombyx mori. Pull-down assay result showed that KPNA3 can pull down heat shock transcription factor (HSF) from proteins extracted from tissues using non-denature lysis buffer.

Histone H3 cleavage, mtDNA extrusion, and cGAMP increase suggested innate immunity activation. However, the deletion of downstream STING/IFNAR failed to alleviate pathology. As markers of underlying mitochondrial pathology, we observed an accumulation of PRLTS proteins ERAL1, PEO1, and HARS2. We propose that the loss of CLPP leads to the extrusion of mitochondrial nucleotide-binding proteins to cytosol and nucleus, affecting late meiotic prophase progression, and causing cell death prior to M-phase entry. This phenotype is more severe than in mito-mice or mutator-mice. KPNA3-knockdown eliminates the second heat shock protein peak associated with the heat shock response of male silkworm pupae (Bombyx mori) by reducing heat shock factor transport into the nucleus. In this study, we investigated the role of karyopherin alpha 3 in the heat shock response in male silkworm pupae. Karyopherin alpha recognizes the classical\nin gametogenesis. All HSF family members are expressed during mammalian spermatogenesis, mainly in spermatocytes and round spermatids which are characterized by extensive chromatin remodeling. Different HSFs could cooperate to maintain proper spermatogenesis. Cooperation of HSF1 and HSF2 is especially well established since their double knockout results in meiosis arrest, spermatocyte apoptosis, and male infertility. Both factors are also involved in the repackaging of the DNA during spermatid differentiation. They can form heterotrimers regulating the basal level of transcription of target genes. Moreover, HSF1/HSF2 interactions are lost in elevated temperatures which can impair the transcription of genes essential for spermatogenesis. In most mammals, spermatogenesis occurs a few degrees below the body temperature and spermatogenic cells are extremely heat-sensitive. Pro-survival pathways are not induced by heat stress (e.g., cryptorchidism) in meiotic and postmeiotic cells. Instead, male germ cells are actively eliminated by apoptosis, which prevents transition of the potentially damaged genetic material\npostmeiotic cells. Instead, male germ cells are actively eliminated by apoptosis, which prevents transition of the potentially damaged genetic material to the next generation. Such a response depends on the transcriptional activity of HSF1 which in contrary to most somatic cells, acts as a proapoptotic factor in spermatogenic cells. HSF1 activation could be the main trigger of impaired spermatogenesis related not only to elevated temperature but also to other stress conditions; therefore, HSF1 has been proposed to be the quality control factor in male germ cells.\nCLPP Depletion Causes Diplotene Arrest; Underlying Testis Mitochondrial Dysfunction Occurs with Accumulation of Perrault Proteins ERAL1, PEO1, and HARS2. Human Perrault syndrome (PRLTS) is autosomal, recessively inherited, and characterized by ovarian insufficiency with hearing loss.

Histology, immunocytology, different OMICS and biochemical approaches, and RT-qPCR were employed in CLPP-null mouse testis. Meiotic chromosome pairing and synapsis proceeded normally. However, the foci number of the crossover marker MLH1 was slightly reduced, and foci persisted in diplotene, most likely due to premature desynapsis, associated with an accumulation of the DNA damage marker \u03b3H2AX.

Here, we will review recent advances in understanding the subunit composition and the mechanisms and roles for Ca2+/CaM-dependent inhibition in olfactory and rod CNG channels. Molecular cloning and functional characterization of a new modulatory cyclic nucleotide-gated channel subunit from mouse retina. Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels play a key role in olfactory and visual transduction. Native CNG channels are heteromeric complexes consisting of the principal alpha subunits (CNG1-3), which can form functional channels by themselves, and the modulatory beta subunits (CNG4-5). The individual alpha and beta subunits that combine to form the CNG channels in rod photoreceptors (CNG1 + CNG4) and olfactory neurons (CNG2 + CNG4 + CNG5) have been characterized. In contrast, only an alpha subunit (CNG3) has been identified so far in cone photoreceptors. Here we report the molecular cloning of a new CNG channel subunit (CNG6) from mouse retina. The\nbeta beta dimers to those from alpha and beta monomers. Taken together, our results are most consistent with an alpha-alpha-beta-beta arrangement for the heteromeric olfactory CNG channel. Functionally important calmodulin-binding sites in both NH2- and COOH-terminal regions of the cone photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated channel CNGB3 subunit. Whereas an important aspect of sensory adaptation in rod photoreceptors and olfactory receptor neurons is thought to be the regulation of cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel activity by calcium-calmodulin (Ca2+-CaM), it is not clear that cone photoreceptor CNG channels are similarly modulated. Cone CNG channels are composed of at least two different subunit types, CNGA3 and CNGB3. We have investigated whether calmodulin modulates the activity of these channels by direct binding to the CNGB3 subunit. Heteromeric channels were formed by co-expression of human CNGB3 with human CNGA3 subunits in Xenopus oocytes; CNGB3 subunits conferred sensitivity to regulation by Ca2+-CaM, whereas CaM regulation of homomeric CNGA3\nalter ligand binding and channel gating in cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. Cytoplasmic cAMP and cGMP are soluble cellular messengers that directly activate cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels. These channels mediate sensory transduction in photoreceptors and olfactory neurons. The closely related CNG channels in these cell types have different nucleotide activation profiles, and we have investigated the molecular basis of their nucleotide selectivity properties. Previously, we predicted that the purine moiety of the nucleotide interacts with residues F533, K596, and D604 (bovine rod alpha CNG channel subunit sequences) of the nucleotide binding domain. In this study, we replaced these three residues with the corresponding residues of the bovine olfactory CNG channel. Mutations at each position altered the nucleotide activation of the rod CNG channels. In a mutant where K596 was replaced with arginine, cAMP-activated currents were enhanced 8-12-fold, suggesting that residue 596 influences channel gating. Thermodynamic cycle analysis of the data showed that\nof odorant signal in an olfactory sensory neuron. Differential regulation by cyclic nucleotides of the CNGA4 and CNGB1b subunits in olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. Olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channels are essential contributors to signal transduction of olfactory sensory neurons. The activity of the channels is controlled by the cyclic nucleotides guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) and adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP). The olfactory CNG channels are composed of two CNGA2 subunits, one CNGA4 and one CNGB1b subunit, each containing a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain. Using patch-clamp fluorometry, we measured ligand binding and channel activation simultaneously and showed that cGMP activated olfactory CNG channels not only by binding to the two CNGA2 subunits but also by binding to the CNGA4 subunit. In a channel in which the CNGA2 subunits were compromised for ligand binding, cGMP binding to CNGA4 was sufficient to partly activate the channel. In contrast, in heterotetrameric channels, the CNGB1b subunit did not\nbinding to CNGA4 was sufficient to partly activate the channel. In contrast, in heterotetrameric channels, the CNGB1b subunit did not bind cGMP, but channels with this subunit showed activation by cAMP. Thus, the modulatory subunits participate actively in translating ligand binding to activation of heterotetrameric olfactory CNG channels and enable the channels to differentiate between cyclic nucleotides. Efficient coupling of ligand binding to channel opening by the binding domain of a modulatory (beta) subunit of the olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated channel. CNG channels in vivo are heteromers of homologous alpha and beta subunits that each contain a six-transmembrane segment domain and a COOH-terminal cytoplasmic cyclic nucleotide binding domain (BD). In heterologous expression systems, heteromeric alphabeta channels activate with greater sensitivity to ligand than do homomeric alpha channels; however, ligand-gating of channels containing only beta subunit BDs has never been studied because beta subunits cannot form functional homomeric CNG channels. To characterize\nadverse effect on the channel's activity and cellular processing. Stoichiometry and arrangement of heteromeric olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels. Native cylic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels are composed of alpha and beta subunits. Olfactory CNG channels were expressed from rat cDNA clones in Xenopus oocytes and studied in inside-out patches. Using tandem dimers composed of linked subunits, we investigated the stoichiometry and arrangement of the alpha and beta subunits. Dimers contained three subunit types: alphawt, betawt, and alpham. The alpham subunit lacks an amino-terminal domain that greatly influences gating, decreasing the apparent affinity of the channel for ligand by 9-fold, making it a reporter for inclusion in the tetramer. Homomeric channels from injection of alphawtalphawt dimers and from alphawt monomers were indistinguishable. Channels from injection of alphawtalpham dimers had apparent affinities 3-fold lower than alphawt homomultimers, suggesting a channel with two alphawt and two alpham subunits. Channels from coinjection of alphawtalphawt and\nthe cone cyclic nucleotide-gated channel CNGA3 subunit alter the local secondary structure and interfere with the channel active conformational change. The cone photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel plays a pivotal role in phototransducton. Mutations in the channel subunits are associated with achromatopsia and progressive cone dystrophy in humans. More than 50 mutations have been identified in the channel CNGA3 subunit, with 50% of them located in the carboxyl (C) terminus. This study investigates the defects of the two frequently occurring mutations, R377W and F488L, in the C-terminus of CNGA3. Ratiometric measurement of the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and electrophysiological recordings showed the loss of functional activity of the mutant channels in an HEK293 heterologous expression system. Immunofluorescence labeling revealed an apparent cytosolic aggregation of the mutant channels compared to the wild type (WT). The R377W and F488L mutants, expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to the\ncAMP-activated currents were enhanced 8-12-fold, suggesting that residue 596 influences channel gating. Thermodynamic cycle analysis of the data showed that (1) the residues are energetically coupled and (2) energetic coupling exists between the potentiating effects of Ni2+ and the replacement of F533 with tyrosine. These data suggest that changes in one of the residues alter the purine contacts with the other residues and that F533 communicates with the C-linker region of the channel involved in Ni2+ potentiation. Calcium/calmodulin modulation of olfactory and rod cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels. Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channels mediate sensory transduction in olfactory sensory neurons and retinal photoreceptor cells. In these systems, internal calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) inhibits CNG channels, thereby having a putative role in sensory adaptation. Functional differences in Ca2+/CaM-dependent inhibition depend on the different subunit composition of olfactory and rod CNG channels. Recent evidence shows that three subunit types (CNGA2, CNGA4, and CNGB1b) make up\nthe data indicate that CNG6 represents a new CNG channel beta subunit that may associate with the CNG3 alpha subunit to form the native cone channel. Bimodal agonism in heteromeric cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. Direct binding of cGMP or cAMP to tetrameric cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels will normally promote the open (conductive) conformation. However, the catfish CNGA2 subtype exhibits bimodal agonism, whereby open probability (P(o)) increases with initial cGMP binding events (\"pro\" action) but decreases with subsequent cGMP binding events (\"con\" action) that occur at concentrations above 3 mM. We constructed, and heterologously expressed, chimeric CNG channel subunits with sequence substitutions in the binding domain (BD), and tested their activation using patch-clamp of cell-free membranes. A normal subunit with the rat CNGA4 BD (with only pro action) could be converted into a bimodal subunit (both pro and con action) by replacing the N-terminal portion of the BD with catfish CNGA2 sequence.\nand no fast modulation by Ca2+-calmodulin. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed the presence of a CNGA2/CNGA4 channel in the olfactory epithelium of CNGB1-/- mice. This CNGA2/CNGA4 channel was targeted to the plasma membrane of olfactory knobs, but failed to be trafficked into olfactory cilia. Interestingly, we observed a similar trafficking defect in mice deficient for the CNGA4 subunit. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that CNGB1 has a dual function in vivo. First, it endows the olfactory CNG channel with a variety of biophysical properties tailored to the specific requirements of olfactory transduction. Second, together with the CNGA4 subunit, CNGB1 is needed for ciliary targeting of the olfactory CNG channel. Alternative splicing governs cone cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel sensitivity to regulation by phosphoinositides. Precursor mRNA encoding CNGA3 subunits of cone photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels undergoes alternative splicing, generating isoforms differing in the N-terminal cytoplasmic region of the protein. In humans, four variants arise\nmechanism by which vertebrate olfactory sensory neurons rapidly adapt to odorants is feedback modulation of the Ca(2+)-permeable cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) transduction channels. Extensive heterologous studies of homomeric CNGA2 channels have led to a molecular model of channel modulation based on the binding of calcium-calmodulin to a site on the cytoplasmic amino terminus of CNGA2. Native rat olfactory CNG channels, however, are heteromeric complexes of three homologous but distinct subunits. Notably, in heteromeric channels, we found no role for CNGA2 in feedback modulation. Instead, an IQ-type calmodulin-binding site on CNGB1b and a similar but previously unidentified site on CNGA4 are necessary and sufficient. These sites seem to confer binding of Ca(2+)-free calmodulin (apocalmodulin), which is then poised to trigger inhibition of native channels in the presence of Ca(2+). Native cone photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated channel is a heterotetrameric complex comprising both CNGA3 and CNGB3: a study using the cone-dominant retina of Nrl-/-\ncyclic nucleotide-gated channel is a heterotetrameric complex comprising both CNGA3 and CNGB3: a study using the cone-dominant retina of Nrl-/- mice. Cone vision mediated by photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel activation is essential for central and color vision and visual acuity. Mutations in genes encoding the cone CNG channel subunits, CNGA3 and CNGB3, have been linked to various forms of achromatopsia and progressive cone dystrophy in humans. This study investigates the biochemical components of native cone CNG channels, using the cone-dominant retina in mice deficient in the transcription factor neural retina leucine zipper (Nrl). Abundant expression of CNGA3 and CNGB3 but no rod CNG channel expression was detected in Nrl-/- retina by western blotting and immunolabeling. Localization of cone CNG channel in both blue (S)- and red/green (M)-cones was shown by double immunolabeling using antibodies against the channel subunits and against the S- and M-opsins. Immunolabeling also showed co-localization of\ncone photoreceptor adaptation and recovery. Loss of CNGB1 protein leads to olfactory dysfunction and subciliary cyclic nucleotide-gated channel trapping. Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) employ a cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel to generate a receptor current in response to an odorant-induced rise in cAMP. This channel contains three types of subunits, the principal CNGA2 subunit and two modulatory subunits (CNGA4 and CNGB1b). Here, we have analyzed the functional relevance of CNGB1 for olfaction by gene targeting in mice. Electro-olfactogram responses of CNGB1-deficient (CNGB1-/-) mice displayed a reduced maximal amplitude and decelerated onset and recovery kinetics compared with wild-type mice. In a behavioral test, CNGB1-/- mice exhibited a profoundly decreased olfactory performance. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that ORNs of CNGB1-/- mice weakly expressed a CNG current with decreased cAMP sensitivity, very rapid flicker-gating behavior and no fast modulation by Ca2+-calmodulin. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed the presence of a CNGA2/CNGA4 channel in the olfactory epithelium of CNGB1-/-\nby double immunolabeling using antibodies against the channel subunits and against the S- and M-opsins. Immunolabeling also showed co-localization of CNGA3 and CNGB3 in the mouse retina. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated the direct interaction between CNGA3 and CNGB3. Chemical cross-linking readily generated products at sizes consistent with oligomers of the channel complexes ranging from dimeric to tetrameric complexes, in a concentration- and time-dependent pattern. Thus this work provides the first biochemical evidence showing the inter-subunit interaction between CNGA3 and CNGB3 and the presence of heterotetrameric complexes of the native cone CNG channel in retina. No association between CNGA3 and the cone Na(+)/Ca(2+)-K(+) exchanger (NCKX2) was shown by co-immunoprecipitation and chemical cross-linking. This may implicate a distinct modulatory mechanism for Ca(2+) homeostasis in cones compared to rods. Stoichiometry and assembly of olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. Native ion channels are precisely tuned to their physiological role in neuronal signaling. This tuning frequently involves the\nnucleotide-gated channels. Native ion channels are precisely tuned to their physiological role in neuronal signaling. This tuning frequently involves the controlled assembly of heteromeric channels comprising multiple types of subunits. Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels of olfactory neurons are tetramers and require three types of subunits, CNGA2, CNGA4, and CNGB1b, to exhibit properties necessary for olfactory transduction. Using fluorescently tagged subunits and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), we find the subunit composition of heteromeric olfactory channels in the surface membrane is fixed, with 2:1:1 CNGA2:CNGA4:CNGB1b. Furthermore, when expressed individually with CNGA2, CNGA4 and CNGB1b subunits were still present in only a single copy and, when expressed alone, did not self-assemble. These results suggest that the precise assembly of heteromeric olfactory channels results from a mechanism where CNGA4 and CNGB1b subunits have a high affinity for CNGA2 but not for self-assembly, precluding more than one CNGA4 or CNGB1b subunit in the channel\ntype (WT). The R377W and F488L mutants, expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to the CNGA3 C-terminal domain, showed no negative effects on interactions with the channel subunits. Circular dichroism spectrum analyses were performed to examine the structural impact of the mutations. Although the R377W and F488L C-termini mutants retained stable, folded structures, the secondary structures of both mutants differed from the WT protein. Furthermore, the WT C-terminus exhibited a significant decrease in alpha-helical content in response to the channel ligands, while this allosteric transition was diminished in the two mutants. This is the first study showing the structural impact of the disease-causing mutations in the cone CNG channel subunit. The observed alterations in the local secondary structure and active conformational change may confer an adverse effect on the channel's activity and cellular processing. Stoichiometry and arrangement of heteromeric olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels. Native\nsubunit BD residues. Notably, both agonists activate X-beta more effectively than X-alpha (higher opening efficacy and lower K(1/2)). The BD is believed to comprise two functionally distinct subdomains: (1) the roll subdomain (beta-roll and flanking A- and B-helices) and (2) the C-helix subdomain. Opening efficacy was previously believed to be controlled primarily by the C-helix, but when we made additional chimeras by exchanging the subdomains between X-beta and X-alpha, we found that both subdomains contain significant determinants of efficacy and agonist selectivity. In particular, only channels containing the roll subdomain of the beta subunit had high efficacy. Thermodynamic linkage analysis shows that interaction between the two subdomains accounts for a significant portion of their contribution to activation energetics. Three residues predicted by molecular modeling to interact with the purine moiety alter ligand binding and channel gating in cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. Cytoplasmic cAMP and cGMP are soluble cellular messengers that directly\nof con action to neighbouring subunits implies a cooperative mechanism. Pseudechetoxin binds to the pore turret of cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels. Peptide toxins are invaluable tools for studying the structure and physiology of ion channels. Pseudechetoxin (PsTx) is the first known peptide toxin that targets cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channels, which play a critical role in sensory transduction in the visual and olfactory systems. PsTx inhibited channel currents at low nM concentrations when applied to the extracellular face of membrane patches expressing olfactory CNGA2 subunits. Surprisingly, 500 nM PsTx did not inhibit currents through channels formed by the CNGA3 subunit from cone photoreceptors. We have exploited this difference to identify the PsTx-binding site on the extracellular face of CNG channels. Studies using chimeric channels revealed that transplantation of the pore domain from CNGA2 was sufficient to confer high affinity PsTx binding upon a CNGA3 background. To further define the binding\nthe function of invertebrate homologs found in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and Limulus is largely unknown, except for two subunits of C. elegans that play a role in chemosensation. CNG channels are nonselective cation channels that do not discriminate well between alkali ions and even pass divalent cations, in particular Ca2+. Ca2+ entry through CNG channels is important for both excitation and adaptation of sensory cells. CNG channel activity is modulated by Ca2+/calmodulin and by phosphorylation. Other factors may also be involved in channel regulation. Mutations in CNG channel genes give rise to retinal degeneration and color blindness. In particular, mutations in the A and B subunits of the CNG channel expressed in human cones cause various forms of complete and incomplete achromatopsia. The disease-causing mutations in the carboxyl terminus of the cone cyclic nucleotide-gated channel CNGA3 subunit alter the local secondary structure and interfere with the channel active conformational change.\nreceptor potential. Olfactory CNG channels are composed of two CNGA2 subunits and two modulatory subunits, CNGA4, and CNGB1b. So far the exact role of the modulatory subunits for channel activation is not fully understood. By measuring ligand binding and channel activation simultaneously, we show that in functional heterotetrameric channels not only the CNGA2 subunits and the CNGA4 subunit but also the CNGB1b subunit binds cyclic nucleotides and, moreover, also alone translates this signal to open the pore. In addition, we show that the CNGB1b subunit is the most sensitive subunit in a heterotetrameric channel to cyclic nucleotides and that it accelerates deactivation to a similar extent as does the CNGA4 subunit. In conclusion, the CNGB1b subunit participates in ligand-gated activation of olfactory CNG channels and, particularly, contributes to rapid termination of odorant signal in an olfactory sensory neuron.

Three-dimensional structure of herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoprotein D at 2.4-nanometer resolution. Herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoprotein D (gD) is essential for virus infectivity and is responsible for binding to cellular membrane proteins and subsequently promoting fusion between the virus envelope and the cell. No structural data are available for gD or for any other herpesvirus envelope protein. Here we present a three-dimensional model for the baculovirus-expressed truncated protein gD1(306t) based on electron microscopic data. We demonstrate that gD1(306t) appears as a homotetramer containing a pronounced pocket in the center of the molecule. Monoclonal antibody binding demonstrates that the molecule is oriented such that the pocket protrudes away from the virus envelope. Disulfide bond structure of glycoprotein D of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Glycoprotein D (gD) is a structural component of the herpes simplex\nto promote viral entry. Although we know a great deal about how gD binds its receptors, until now we have been unable to demonstrate a direct interaction between gD and gH/gL. Here, we used a highly sensitive surface plasmon resonance technique to clearly demonstrate that gD and gH/gL interact. Furthermore, using multiple MAbs with defined epitopes, we have delineated a domain on gD that is independent of that used for receptor binding and which likely represents the gH/gL interaction domain. Targeting this interaction to prevent fusion may enhance both therapeutic and vaccine strategies. The domains of glycoprotein D required to block apoptosis induced by herpes simplex virus 1 are largely distinct from those involved in cell-cell fusion and binding to nectin1. Glycoprotein D (gD) interacts with two alternative protein receptors, nectin1 and HveA, to mediate herpes simplex virus (HSV) entry into cells. Fusion of the envelope with the plasma membrane\nD of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Glycoprotein D (gD) is a structural component of the herpes simplex virus envelope which is essential for virus penetration. The function of this protein is highly dependent on its structure, and its structure is dependent on maintenance of three intact disulfide bonds. gD contains six cysteines in its ectodomain whose spacing is conserved among all its homologs in other alphaherpesviruses as well as Marek's disease virus. For other proteins, conservation of cysteine spacing correlates with conservation of disulfide bond structure. We have now solved the disulfide bond structure of gD-1 and gD-2 of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, respectively. Two approaches were used. First, we constructed 15 double-Cys mutants of gD-1, representing all possible disulfide pairs. In each case, codons for cysteines were changed to serine. We reasoned that if two cysteines normally form a disulfide bond, double mutations\neither complementing (gD(-/+) stocks) or noncomplementing cells (gD(-/-) stocks) induce apoptosis. Subsequent studies have shown that apoptosis induced by gD(-/-) mutant virus stocks can be blocked by in trans delivery of viral genes that encode either intact gD or a mixture of two genes encoding the glycoprotein ectodomain plus transmembrane domain (gD-B) and transmembrane domain plus the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of the protein (gD-D), respectively. Since the presence of the transmembrane domains was critical for precluding apoptosis in the bipartite system, the question arose whether the two components, gD-B and gD-D, form a heterodimer mediated by an unpaired cysteine located in the transmembrane domain. We report the following. (i) The substitution of the unpaired cysteine with serine in either gD-B or gD-D truncated forms of gD disabled the ability of gD-D and gD-B to block apoptosis. (ii) Immunoprecipitation of gD-D coprecipitated gD-B only from lysates of cells transduced with gD-D\nwith the C-terminal domain of gD. These results indicate that codons 61-218 of gD do not encode executable functions required for viral entry into cells and suggest that the receptor-binding ligand must interact with but need not alter the structure of the residual portion of gD to effect virus entry. This finding opens the way for the development of a family of recombinant viruses in which the profusion domain of gD and independently furnished, interacting receptor-binding domains effect entry of the virus via a range of receptors. Effects of herpes simplex virus on structure and function of nectin-1/HveC. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) entry requires the interaction between the envelope glycoprotein D (gD) and a cellular receptor such as nectin-1 (also named herpesvirus entry mediator C [HveC]) or HveA/HVEM. Nectin-1 is a cell adhesion molecule found at adherens junctions associated with the cytoplasmic actin-binding protein afadin. Nectin-1 can act as its\nand proteases, and the peptides were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography. Disulfide-linked peptides were subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The results show that cysteine 1 (amino acid [aa] 66) is bonded to cysteine 5 (aa 189), cysteine 2 (aa 106) is bonded to cysteine 6 (aa 202), and cysteine 3 (aa 118) is bonded to cysteine 4 (aa 127). Thus, the biochemical analysis of gD-2 agrees with the genetic analysis of gD-1. A similar disulfide bond arrangement is postulated to exist in other gD homologs. Separation of receptor-binding and profusogenic domains of glycoprotein D of herpes simplex virus 1 into distinct interacting proteins. The 369-residue glycoprotein D (gD) is the entry, receptor-binding protein of herpes simplex virus 1. The common receptors for viral entry are nectin-1, HveA, and a specific O-linked sulfated proteoglycan. The major receptor-binding sites of gD are at the N terminus, whereas the domain required for\nfunctional interaction. The results demonstrate that of the 35 gD and HveA contact residues that comprise the gD-HveA interface, only a handful are critical for complex formation. Glycoprotein D of herpes simplex virus (HSV) binds directly to HVEM, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and a mediator of HSV entry. Glycoprotein D (gD) is a structural component of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) envelope which is essential for virus entry into host cells. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells are one of the few cell types which are nonpermissive for the entry of many HSV strains. However, when these cells are transformed with the gene for the herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), the resulting cells, CHO-HVEM12, are permissive for many HSV strains, such as HSV-1(KOS). By virtue of its four cysteine-rich pseudorepeats, HVEM is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily of proteins. Recombinant forms of gD\ngD-D and gD-B to block apoptosis. (ii) Immunoprecipitation of gD-D coprecipitated gD-B only from lysates of cells transduced with gD-D and gD-B containing the cysteine in the transmembrane domains. Replacement of cysteine with serine ablated coprecipitation of the components. (ii) The mixture of gD-D and gD-B complemented at a low level gD(-/+) virions. We conclude that the gD-B and gD-D can form a heterodimer dependent on the presence of cysteines in the transmembrane domain and the heterodimer can substitute for intact gD but at a much reduced efficiency. Surface Plasmon Resonance Reveals Direct Binding of Herpes Simplex Virus Glycoproteins gH/gL to gD and Locates a gH/gL Binding Site on gD. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) requires fusion between the viral envelope and host membrane. Four glycoproteins, gD, gH/gL, and gB, are essential for this process. To initiate fusion, gD binds its receptor and undergoes a conformational change that hypothetically leads to\nStructure-based mutagenesis of herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D defines three critical regions at the gD-HveA/HVEM binding interface. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) entry into cells requires the binding of glycoprotein D (gD) to one of several cell surface receptors. The crystal structure of gD bound to one of these receptors, HveA/HVEM, reveals that the core of gD comprises an immunoglobulin fold flanked by a long C-terminal extension and an N-terminal hairpin loop. HveA is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family and contains four cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) characteristic of this family. Fourteen amino acids within the gD N-terminal loop comprise the entire binding site for HveA. To determine the contribution of each gD contact residue to virus entry, we constructed gD molecules mutated in these amino acids. We determined the abilities of the gD mutants to bind receptors, facilitate virus entry, and mediate cell-cell fusion. Seven of the gD\nreflected in the ability of gD-1(delta290-299t) but not gD-1(306t) to block HSV type 1 infection of CHO-HVEM12 cells. By gel filtration chromatography, the complex between gD-1(delta290-299t) and HVEM(200t) had a molecular mass of 113 kDa and a molar ratio of 1:2. We conclude that HVEM interacts directly with gD, suggesting that HVEM is a receptor for virion gD and that the interaction between these proteins is a step in HSV entry into HVEM-expressing cells. Truncated forms of glycoprotein D of herpes simplex virus 1 capable of blocking apoptosis and of low-efficiency entry into cells form a heterodimer dependent on the presence of a cysteine located in the shared transmembrane domains. Earlier studies have shown that herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) virions of mutant lacking glycoprotein D (gD) and made in either complementing (gD(-/+) stocks) or noncomplementing cells (gD(-/-) stocks) induce apoptosis. Subsequent studies have shown that apoptosis induced by gD(-/-)\nCRD2 contributes to HveA binding. None of the gD mutations prevented interaction with nectin-1, another gD receptor. However, when cotransfected with the other glycoproteins required for fusion, two gD mutants gained the ability to mediate fusion of cells expressing nectin-2, a gD receptor that interacts with several laboratory-derived gD mutants but not with wild-type gD. Thus, results from this panel of gD mutants as well as those of previous studies (A. Carfi, S. H. Willis, J. C. Whitbeck, C. Krummenacher, G. H. Cohen, R. J. Eisenberg, and D. C. Wiley, Mol. Cell 8:169-179, 2001, and S. A. Connolly, D. J. Landsburg, A. Carfi, D. C. Wiley, R. J. Eisenberg, and G. H. Cohen, J. Virol. 76:10894-10904, 2002) provide a detailed picture of the gD-HveA interface and the contacts required for functional interaction. The results demonstrate that of the 35 gD and HveA contact residues that comprise the gD-HveA interface, only\nthe immunoglobulin core and downstream regions (residue 151 and 187), and at the alpha3 helix (residues 243 and 246). Binding of soluble nectin1-Fc to cells expressing the mutant gDs was generally affected by the same mutations that affected fusion, with one notable exception (Delta277-310), which affected fusion without hampering nectin1 binding. This deletion likely identifies a region of gD involved in fusion activity at a post-nectin1-binding step. We conclude that whereas mutations that affected all functions (e.g., upstream connector region and residue 151) may be detrimental to overall gD structure, the mutations that affect specific activities identify domains of gD involved in the interactions with entry receptors and fusogenic glycoproteins and with cellular proteins required to block apoptosis. The evidence that glycosylation of gD is required for blocking apoptosis supports the conclusion that the interacting protein is the mannose-6 phosphate receptor. Three-dimensional structure of herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoprotein\nnectin1 and HveA, to mediate herpes simplex virus (HSV) entry into cells. Fusion of the envelope with the plasma membrane requires, in addition to gD, glycoproteins gB, gH, and gL. Coexpression of the four glycoproteins (gD, gB, gH, and gL) promotes cell-cell fusion. gD delivered in trans is also capable of blocking the apoptosis induced by gD deletion viruses grown either in noncomplementing cells (gD(-/-)) or in complementing cells (gD(-/+)). While ectopic expression of cation-independent mannose-6 phosphate receptor blocks apoptosis induced by both stocks, other requirements differ. Thus, apoptosis induced by gD(-/-) virus is blocked by full-length gD (or two gD fragments reconstituting a full-length molecule), whereas ectopic expression of the gD ectodomain is sufficient to block apoptosis induced by gD(-/+) virus. In this report we took advantage of a set of gD insertion-deletion mutants to map the domains of gD required to block apoptosis by gD(-/-) and gD(-/+) viruses\nessential for this process. To initiate fusion, gD binds its receptor and undergoes a conformational change that hypothetically leads to activation of gH/gL, which in turn triggers the fusion protein gB to undergo rearrangements leading to membrane fusion. Our model predicts that gD must interact with both its receptor and gH/gL to promote fusion. In support of this, we have shown that gD is structurally divided into two \"faces\": one for the binding receptor and the other for its presumed interaction with gH/gL. However, until now, we have been unable to demonstrate a direct interaction between gD and gH/gL. Here, we used surface plasmon resonance to show that the ectodomain of gH/gL binds directly to the ectodomain of gD when (i) gD is captured by certain anti-gD monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that are bound to a biosensor chip, (ii) gD is bound to either one of its receptors on a chip,\nfour cysteine-rich pseudorepeats, HVEM is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily of proteins. Recombinant forms of gD and HVEM, gD-1(306t) and HVEM(200t), respectively, were used to demonstrate a specific physical interaction between these two proteins. This interaction was dependent on native gD conformation but independent of its N-linked oligosaccharides, as expected from previous structure-function studies. Recombinant forms of gD derived from HSV-1(KOS)rid1 and HSV-1(ANG) did not bind to HVEM(200t), explaining the inability of these viruses to infect CHO-HVEM12 cells. A variant gD protein, gD-1(delta290-299t), showed enhanced binding to HVEM(200t) relative to the binding of gD-1(306t). Competition studies showed that gD-1(delta290-299t) and gD-1(306t) bound to the same region of HVEM(200t), suggesting that the differences in binding to HVEM are due to differences in affinity. These differences were also reflected in the ability of gD-1(delta290-299t) but not gD-1(306t) to block HSV type 1 infection of CHO-HVEM12 cells. By gel\nspecific O-linked sulfated proteoglycan. The major receptor-binding sites of gD are at the N terminus, whereas the domain required for fusion of viral envelope with the plasma membrane is at the C terminus of the ectodomain (residues 260-310). In the course of retargeting gD to the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) receptor for potential therapeutic applications, we obtained a genetically engineered infectious virus in which the receptor-binding domain consisting of the N-terminal domain of uPA fused to residues 33-60 of gD was separated from an independently expressed C-terminal domain of gD containing residues 219-369. The intervening sequences (residues 62-218) were replaced by a stop codon and a promoter for the C-terminal domain of gD. The physical interaction of the two components was reconstructed by coimmunoprecipitation of the N-terminal domain of uPA with the C-terminal domain of gD. These results indicate that codons 61-218 of gD do not encode executable functions required\ninfection, nectin-1 was not downregulated from the cell surface. Rather, detection of nectin-1 changed gradually over a 30-min period of infection, as reflected by a decrease in the CK41 epitope and an increase in the CK35 epitope. The level of detection of virion gD on the cell surface increased within 5 min of infection in a receptor-dependent manner. These observations suggest that cell surface nectin-1 and gD may undergo conformational changes during HSV entry as part of an evolving interaction between the viral envelope and the cell plasma membrane.\ncodons for cysteines were changed to serine. We reasoned that if two cysteines normally form a disulfide bond, double mutations which eliminate one proper bond should be less harmful to gD structure than double mutations which eliminate two disulfide bonds. The mutated genes were cloned into a eucaryotic expression vector, and the proteins were expressed in transiently transfected cells. Three double mutations, Cys-1,5, Cys-2,6, and Cys-3,4 permitted gD-1 folding, processing, transport to the cell surface, and function in virus infection, whereas 12 other double mutations each produced a malfolded and nonfunctional protein. Thus, the three functional double-Cys mutants may represent the actual partners in disulfide bond linkages. The second approach was to define the actual disulfide bond structure of gD by biochemical means. Purified native gD-2 was cleaved by CNBr and proteases, and the peptides were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography. Disulfide-linked peptides were subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing.\na cell adhesion molecule found at adherens junctions associated with the cytoplasmic actin-binding protein afadin. Nectin-1 can act as its own ligand in a homotypic interaction to bridge cells together. We used a cell aggregation assay to map an adhesive functional site on nectin-1 and identify the effects of gD binding and HSV early infection on nectin-1 function. Soluble forms of nectin-1 and anti-nectin-1 monoclonal antibodies were used to map a functional adhesive site within the first immunoglobulin-like domain (V domain) of nectin-1. This domain also contains the gD-binding site, which appeared to overlap the adhesive site. Thus, soluble forms of gD were able to prevent nectin-1-mediated cell aggregation and to disrupt cell clumps in an affinity-dependent manner. HSV also prevented nectin-1-mediated cell aggregation by occupying the receptor. Early in infection, nectin-1 was not downregulated from the cell surface. Rather, detection of nectin-1 changed gradually over a 30-min period of\nthe abilities of the gD mutants to bind receptors, facilitate virus entry, and mediate cell-cell fusion. Seven of the gD mutants exhibited wild-type levels of receptor binding and gD function. Results from the other seven gD mutants revealed three critical regions at the gD-HveA interface. (i) Several gD residues that participate in an intermolecular beta-sheet with HveA were found to be crucial for HveA binding and entry into HveA-expressing cells. (ii) Two gD residues that contact HveA-Y23 contributed to HveA binding but were not required for mediating entry into cells. HveA-Y23 fits into a crevice on the surface of gD and was previously shown to be essential for gD binding. (iii) CRD2 was previously shown to contribute to gD binding, and this study shows that one gD residue that contacts CRD2 contributes to HveA binding. None of the gD mutations prevented interaction with nectin-1, another gD receptor. However, when cotransfected",

The pseudocoleomic location, presence in all life cycle stages, lack of inhibitory activity against pepsin, and inhibitory activity against excretory/secretory products suggest that Ac-API-1 inhibits an unidentified, putative aspartyl protease secreted by adult hookworms, and may be released as an enzyme-inhibitor complex. The highly immunogenic properties of nematode aspins suggest that Ac-API-1 represents a promising target for a recombinant hookworm vaccine. Estrogen-induced lysosomal proteases secreted by breast cancer cells: a role in carcinogenesis? In an attempt to understand the mechanism by which estrogens stimulate cell proliferation and mammary carcinogenesis, metastatic human breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, ZR75-1) were found to secrete a 52,000 dalton (52K) protein under estrogen stimulation. Following its purification to homogeneity, the 52K protein was identified as a secreted procathepsin-D-like aspartyl protease bearing mannose-6-phosphate signals.\ntarget. We conclude that C. tropicalis secretes Sapt1 to target the complement lectin pathway, a key pattern recognition and clearance mechanism, for its survival and pathogenesis. Cloning and characterisation of an aspartyl protease inhibitor (API-1) from Ancylostoma hookworms. Hookworm infection persists as a public health problem in developing nations. Vaccine-based strategies offer the best chance of long-term control. Aspartyl protease inhibitors from parasitic nematodes are highly immunogenic, and have been suggested as potential vaccine antigens. An aspartyl protease inhibitor, API-1, was cloned and characterised from the hookworms Ancylostoma caninum and Ancylostoma ceylanicum. Using sequence from the hookworm expressed sequence tag project, specific primers were designed and used to amplify Ac-api-1 from A. caninum infective L3 cDNA by PCR. Amplicons from the 5' and 3' ends were cloned, sequenced, and combined to create an 874-bp full-length composite sequence of the Ac-api-1 gene. The A. ceylanicum api-1 cDNA of 878 bp was\nto create an 874-bp full-length composite sequence of the Ac-api-1 gene. The A. ceylanicum api-1 cDNA of 878 bp was cloned from L3 cDNA using the A. caninum primers. The amino acid sequences of hookworm orthologues were nearly identical, and database searching indicated they belonged to the aspin family, a group of nematode specific aspartyl protease inhibitors that includes the Ascaris pepsin inhibitor PI-3. Ac-api-1 mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase PCR in eggs, L1, L3 and adult life cycle stages. A polyclonal antiserum against Escherichia coli expressed recombinant Ac-API-1 detected the protein in adult A. caninum excretory/secretory products, but not in those from activated infective larvae. Immunolocalisation experiments using the antiserum indicated that Ac-API-1 is present primarily in the pseudocoelomic fluid in adult hookworms. Soluble, yeast-expressed Ac-API-1 failed to inhibit pepsin or a hookworm gut aspartyl protease in vitro, but inhibited approximately 30% of the proteolytic activity of adult\ntheir ability to bind Notch or traffic with it to the cell surface, and did not alter the secretion of Notch. Thus, PS1 appears to function specifically in Notch proteolysis near the plasma membrane as an aspartyl protease or cofactor. Inactivation of the Complement Lectin Pathway by Candida tropicalis Secreted Aspartyl Protease-1. Candida tropicalisis an opportunistic fungal pathogen and is one of the most frequently isolated non-albicans species. It can cause localised as well as invasive systemic infections particularly in immunocompromised patients. Increased resistance to common anti-fungal drugs is an emerging problem. In order to establish disseminated infections, Candida has evolved several strategies to escape the host immune system. A detailed understanding of how C. tropicalis escapes the host immune attack is needed as it can help develop novel anti-fungal therapies. Secreted aspartyl proteinases (Saps) of C. albicans have been shown to be determinants of virulence and immune evasion. However,\nonly influenced by the pH change from 3.8 to 4.4. Binding of acetyl-pepstatin to Sap1 or Sap2 obviously proceeds by a different mechanism than dissociation of the inhibitor. Association appears to be coupled to protonation of a catalytic aspartic acid residue, consistent with reduced k(on) values at higher pH. In contrast, the stability of the complex is reduced at lower pH due to reduced hydrogen bonding capacity of aspartic acid residues acting as hydrogen bond acceptors. Differences in the number and distribution of charged nonactive site residues in Sap1 and Sap2 evidently result in different electrostatic properties of the binding sites, primarily influencing the association step. Insights into the selective inhibition of Candida albicans secreted aspartyl protease: a docking analysis study. Severe fungal infections have taken precedence over other bacterial infections. Of the several fungal species, Candida albicans and others belonging to the genus Candida are responsible for several clinically\ntherapies. Secreted aspartyl proteinases (Saps) of C. albicans have been shown to be determinants of virulence and immune evasion. However, the immune evasion properties of C. tropicalis Saps have been poorly characterised. This study investigated the immune evasion properties of C. tropicalis secreted aspartic protease 1 (Sapt1).Sapt1 was recombinantly produced using a Kluyveromyces lactis yeast expression system. A range of complement proteins and immunogloublins were screened to test if Sapt1 had any proteolytic activity. Sapt1 efficiently cleaved human mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and collectin-11, which are the initiating molecules of the lectin pathway of the complement system, but not l-ficolin. In addition, Sapt1 cleaved DC-SIGN, the receptor on antigen presenting dendritic cells. Proteolysis was prominent in acidic condition (pH 5.2), a characteristic of aspartyl protease. No proteolytic activity was detected against complement proteins C1q, C3, C3b, IgG and IgA. In view of the ability of Sapt1 to cleave MBL and collectin-11,\nof C. albicans SAP2X. Hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions in the various subsites of the enzyme, contributing to both increase as well as decrease in selectivity of the molecules have been detailed. Hydrogen bonding interaction plays an important role for amino acid residues such as Gly-85, Asp-86, Asp-32, Asp-218, Tyr-225, Ala-133, and so on. Significant hydrophobic interactions with the S3, S2 and S2' subsites contribute to selectivity of the compounds. These molecular modeling analyses should, in our view, contribute for further development of selective C. albicans secreted aspartyl protease inhibitors. Cell surface presenilin-1 participates in the gamma-secretase-like proteolysis of Notch. Presenilin-1 (PS1), a polytopic membrane protein primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, is required for efficient proteolysis of both Notch and beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) within their trans- membrane domains. The activity that cleaves APP (called gamma-secretase) has properties of an aspartyl protease, and mutation of either of the two\nutmost functional importance. Kinetic and mechanistic analysis of the association and dissociation of inhibitors interacting with secreted aspartic acid proteases 1 and 2 from Candida albicans. In order to elucidate the characteristics of different aspartic proteases (Sap) secreted by Candida albicans, the kinetics of the interaction (k(on), k(off)) between Sap1 and Sap2 with acetyl-pepstatin and pepstatin A was determined at different pH by biosensor technology. The enzymes were biotinylated and coupled to a streptavidin-coated sensor chip, whereupon acetyl-pepstatin or pepstatin A was injected and the interaction was measured in real time. Sap2 showed a faster k(on) and a higher affinity for acetyl-pepstatin than Sap1, regardless of pH. The values for both k(on) and k(off) decreased with increased pH from 3.8 to 5.0, except for the k(off) for Sap1, which was only influenced by the pH change from 3.8 to 4.4. Binding of acetyl-pepstatin to Sap1 or Sap2 obviously proceeds by\nand characterization of aspartyl protease inhibitor from Ancylostoma ceylanicum. Aspartyl protease inhibitors (APIs) from parasitic intestinal nematodes are highly immunogenic and have been suggested as potential vaccine antigens. Ac-API-1 from Ancylostoma caninum showed strong immunogenicity and its polyclonal antibodies could specifically recognize the excretory/secretory products of adult worms. However, little is known about molecular characteristics and biological function of API from Ancylostoma ceylanicum (Ace-API). In this study, the Ace-API mature peptide coding sequence was cloned and expressed, and molecular characteristics of its full length sequence were analyzed. Ace-API cDNA was 684 bp in length, which encoded 228 amino acids. The similarity of the Ace-API amino acid sequence to Ac-API-1 and Adu-API-1 was 96.93% and 96.49%, respectively, and they clustered together in the phylogenetic tree. Escheria coli-expressed recombinant protein was mainly soluble in the supernatant of bacterial cell lysate. Western blot showed that Ace-API protein had good reactivity to the serum\nCOOH-termini. They differ in that the active site YD and GxGD containing transmembrane domains of SPPs are inverted relative to PSENs, thus, orienting the active site in a consistent topology relative to the substrate. At least two of the human SPPs (SPP and SPPL3) appear to function without additional cofactors, but PSENs function as a protease, called gamma-secretase, only when complexed with Nicastrin, APH-1 and Pen-2. The biological roles of SPP are largely unknown, and only a few endogenous substrates for SPPs have been identified. Nevertheless there is emerging evidence that SPP family members are highly druggable and may regulate both essential physiologic and pathophysiologic processes. Further study of the SPP family is needed in order to understand their biological roles and their potential as therapeutic targets. Molecular cloning, expression and characterization of aspartyl protease inhibitor from Ancylostoma ceylanicum. Aspartyl protease inhibitors (APIs) from parasitic intestinal nematodes are highly immunogenic\nstimulation. Following its purification to homogeneity, the 52K protein was identified as a secreted procathepsin-D-like aspartyl protease bearing mannose-6-phosphate signals. This precursor displays an in vitro autocrine mitogenic activity on estrogen-deprived MCF7 cells and is able to degrade basement membrane and proteoglycans following its autoactivation. The total protease (52K + 48K and 34K) was detected and assayed by monoclonal antibodies and was found to be highly concentrated in proliferative and cystic mastopathies. In breast cancer, its cytosolic concentration appears to be correlated more to tumor invasiveness than to hormone responsiveness. The mRNA of the 52K protease accumulates rapidly following estradiol treatment, as was shown by Northern blot analysis with cloned cDNA. The 52K cathepsin-D-like protease is the first example of a lysosomal protease induced by estrogens in cancer cells. Results obtained using different approaches suggest that two cysteinyl cathepsins are also related to cell transformation and invasiveness. It has been\nbeen described up to now. This facilitates comparison of structural details as well as inhibitor binding modes among the different subgroup members. Structural analysis reveals a highly conserved overall secondary structure of Sap1-3 and Sap5. However, Sap5 clearly differs from Sap1-3 by its electrostatic overall charge as well as through structural conformation of its entrance to the active site cleft. Design of inhibitors specific for Sap5 should concentrate on the S4 and S3 pockets, which significantly differ from Sap1-3 in size and electrostatic charge. Both Sap1 and Sap5 seem to play a major part in superficial Candida infections. Determination of the isoenzymes' structures can contribute to the development of new Sap-specific inhibitors for the treatment of superficial infections with a structure-based drug design program. Functional Characterization of Secreted Aspartyl Proteases in Candida parapsilosis. Candida parapsilosis is an emerging non-albicans Candida species that largely affects low-birth-weight infants and immunocompromised patients. Fungal\nThe activity that cleaves APP (called gamma-secretase) has properties of an aspartyl protease, and mutation of either of the two aspartate residues located in adjacent transmembrane domains of PS1 inhibits gamma-secretase processing of APP. We show here that these aspartates are required for Notch processing, since mutation of these residues prevents PS1 from inducing the gamma-secretase-like proteolysis of a Notch1 derivative. Thus PS1 might function in Notch cleavage as an aspartyl protease or di-aspartyl protease cofactor. However, the ER localization of PS1 is inconsistent with that hypothesis, since Notch cleavage occurs near the cell surface. Using pulse-chase and biotinylation assays, we provide evidence that PS1 binds Notch in the ER/Golgi and is then co-transported to the plasma membrane as a complex. PS1 aspartate mutants were indistinguishable from wild-type PS1 in their ability to bind Notch or traffic with it to the cell surface, and did not alter the secretion of\ninfections. Of the several fungal species, Candida albicans and others belonging to the genus Candida are responsible for several clinically important fungal infections. Emerging cases of drug resistance to the currently available drugs has limited the spectrum of currently available antifungal agents. Thus, it is imperative that new biochemical targets are identified so that better effective and selective agents can be developed. Many enzymes contribute towards the complex disease process of fungal infections; the secreted aspartyl protease (SAP), expressed both in vitro and during infection, has been implicated as one of the major virulence factors of C. albicans. Three-dimensional crystal structures of C. albicans SAP and closely related clinical isolate designated as SAP2X complexed with the same potent inhibitor A-70450 have been reported. Several analogues of A-70450 with potent C. albicans SAP2X inhibitory activity are also known. However, the structural effects of the binding of these compounds with the enzyme\nSignal peptide peptidases: a family of intramembrane-cleaving proteases that cleave type 2 transmembrane proteins. Five genes encode the five human signal peptide peptidases (SPPs), which are intramembrane-cleaving aspartyl proteases (aspartyl I-CLiPs). SPPs have been conserved through evolution with family members found in higher eukaryotes, fungi, protozoa, arachea, and plants. SPPs are related to the presenilin family of aspartyl I-CLiPs but differ in several key aspects. Presenilins (PSENs) and SPPs both cleave the transmembrane region of membrane proteins; however, PSENs cleave type 1 membrane proteins whereas SPPs cleave type 2 membrane proteins. Though the overall homology between SPPs and PSENs is minimal, they are multipass membrane proteins that contain two conserved active site motifs YD and GxGD in adjacent membrane-spanning domains and a conserved PAL motif of unknown function near their COOH-termini. They differ in that the active site YD and GxGD containing transmembrane domains of SPPs are inverted relative to\nin Candida parapsilosis. Candida parapsilosis is an emerging non-albicans Candida species that largely affects low-birth-weight infants and immunocompromised patients. Fungal pathogenesis is promoted by the dynamic expression of diverse virulence factors, with secreted proteolytic enzymes being linked to the establishment and progression of disease. Although secreted aspartyl proteases (Sap) are critical for Candida albicans pathogenicity, their role in C. parapsilosis is poorly elucidated. In the present study, we aimed to examine the contribution of C. parapsilosisSAPP genes SAPP1, SAPP2, and SAPP3 to the virulence of the species. Our results indicate that SAPP1 and SAPP2, but not SAPP3, influence adhesion, host cell damage, phagosome-lysosome maturation, phagocytosis, killing capacity, and cytokine secretion by human peripheral blood-derived macrophages. Purified Sapp1p and Sapp2p were also shown to efficiently cleave host complement component 3b (C3b) and C4b proteins and complement regulator factor H. Additionally, Sapp2p was able to cleave factor H-related protein 5 (FHR-5). Altogether,\ncomplement proteins C1q, C3, C3b, IgG and IgA. In view of the ability of Sapt1 to cleave MBL and collectin-11, we found that Sapt1 could prevent activation of the complement lectin pathway. RT-qPCR analysis using three different C. tropicalis clinical isolates (oral, blood and peritoneal dialysis fluid) revealed relatively higher levels of mRNA expression of Sapt1 gene when compared to a reference strain; Sapt1 protein was found to be secreted by all the tested strains. Lectin pathway and its initiating components are crucial to provide front line defence against Candida infections. For the first time, we have shown that a Candida protease can proteolytically degrade the key initiating components of lectin pathway and inhibit complement activation. Findings from this study highlight the importance of exploring Sapt1 as a potential therapeutic target. We conclude that C. tropicalis secretes Sapt1 to target the complement lectin pathway, a key pattern recognition and clearance\nCandida albicans (C. albicans). It is attributed to the family of the secreted aspartic proteinases (Saps) from C. albicans with a minimum of 10 members. Saps show controlled expression and regulation for the individual stages of the infection process. Distinct isoenzymes can be responsible for adherence and tissue damage of local infections, while others cause systemic diseases. Earlier, only the structures of Sap2 and Sap3 were known. In our research, we have now succeeded in solving the X-ray crystal structures of the apoenzyme of Sap1 and Sap5 in complex with pepstatin A at 2.05 and 2.5 A resolution, respectively. With the structure of Sap1, we have completed the set of structures of isoenzyme subgroup Sap1-3. Of subgroup Sap4-6, the structure of the enzyme Sap5 is the first structure that has been described up to now. This facilitates comparison of structural details as well as inhibitor binding modes among the different\nand C4b proteins and complement regulator factor H. Additionally, Sapp2p was able to cleave factor H-related protein 5 (FHR-5). Altogether, these data demonstrate the diverse, significant contributions that SAPP1 and SAPP2 make to the establishment and progression of disease by C. parapsilosis through enabling the attachment of the yeast cells to mammalian cells and modulating macrophage biology and disruption of the complement cascade.IMPORTANCE Aspartyl proteases are present in various organisms and, among virulent species, are considered major virulence factors. Host tissue and cell damage, hijacking of immune responses, and hiding from innate immune cells are the most common behaviors of fungal secreted proteases enabling pathogen survival and invasion. C. parapsilosis, an opportunistic human-pathogenic fungus mainly threatening low-birth weight neonates and children, possesses three SAPP protein-encoding genes that could contribute to the invasiveness of the species. Our results suggest that SAPP1 and SAPP2, but not SAPP3, influence host evasion by regulating\nobtained using different approaches suggest that two cysteinyl cathepsins are also related to cell transformation and invasiveness. It has been proposed that cathepsin-B is involved in breast cancer and metastatic melanoma, and its regulation by estrogen has been shown in the rat uterus. Cathepsin-L corresponds to the major excreted protein (MEP) whose synthesis and secretion are markedly increased by transformation of NIH 3T3 cells with Ki ras and are regulated by several growth factors. In addition to secreted autocrine growth factors and to other proteases (plasminogen activator, collagenase), lysosomal cathepsins may therefore play an important role in the process of tumor growth and invasion as long as their precursor is secreted abundantly. Analysis of secreted aspartic proteinases from Candida albicans: purification and characterization of individual Sap1, Sap2 and Sap3 isoenzymes. The recently discovered secreted aspartic proteinase multi-gene (SAP) family in Candida albicans has complicated assessment of proteolytic activity as a",

        "desc": "(CVAA), to analyze the pan-cancer dataset, and identified numerous new differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including Progestin and AdipoQ Receptor 4 (PAQR4), a member of the progestin and adipoQ receptor (PAQR) family, which includes 11 members (PAQR1 to PAQR11) in the human genome. The conservation of the PAQR proteins between human and mouse orthologues is high. The prototypes in this family are PAQR5-8 that function as membrane receptors for progesterone, as well as AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 (i.e., PAQR1 and PAQR2) are surface receptors for adiponectin and play important roles in metabolic regulation. Especially, PAQR3, the closest homologue of PAQR4, has been recently discovered as a novel tumor suppressor deregulated in various types of human cancers including colon cancer, gastric cancer, bladder cancer, liver cancer, osteosarcoma, breast cancer, and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. PAQR3 functions as a tumor suppressor mainly due to its negative regulation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade. Moreover, PAQR3\nImportantly, PAQR4 and SKP2 bind to the same region in CDK4, and PAQR4 competes with SKP2 for the binding, thereby abrogating SKP2-mediated ubiquitination of CDK4. Using a two-stage DMBA/TPA-induced skin cancer model, we find that PAQR4-deleted mice are resistant to chemical carcinogen-induced tumor formation. Collectively, our findings reveal that the steady-state level of CDK4 is controlled by the antagonistic actions between PAQR4 and SKP2, contributing to modulation of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. PAQR4 promotes chemoresistance in non-small cell lung cancer through inhibiting Nrf2 protein degradation Purpose: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide. We have previously identified many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from large scale pan-cancer dataset using the Cross-Value Association Analysis (CVAA) method. Here we focus on Progestin and AdipoQ Receptor 4 (PAQR4), a member of the progestin and adipoQ receptor (PAQR) family localized in the Golgi apparatus, to determine their clinical role and mechanism\ninhibitory G protein (G(i)) to down-regulate membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase activity in both st-mPRalpha- and hu-mPRalpha-transfected cells. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate the receptors are directly coupled to the G(i) protein. Similar to G protein-coupled receptors, dissociation of the receptor/G protein complex results in a decrease in ligand binding to the mPRalphas and mutation of the C-terminal, and third intracellular loop of st-mPRalpha causes loss of ligand-dependent G protein activation. Phylogenetic analysis indicates the mPRs are members of a progesterone and adipoQ receptor (PAQR) subfamily that is only present in chordates, whereas other PAQRs also occur in invertebrates and plants. Progesterone and adipoQ receptors are related to the hemolysin3 family and have origins in the Eubacteria. Thus, mPRs arose from Eubacteria independently from members of the GPCR superfamily, which arose from Archeabacteria, suggesting convergent evolution of seven-transmembrane hormone receptors coupled to G proteins. Progestin and AdipoQ Receptor 7, Progesterone Membrane Receptor Component 1\nand mPR\u03b5 function as mPRs coupled to G proteins and are potential intermediaries of nonclassical antiapoptotic actions of neurosteroids in the central nervous system. DDB2 is involved in ubiquitination and degradation of PAQR3 and regulates tumorigenesis of gastric cancer cells. DDB2 (damage-specific DNA-binding protein 2) is the product of the xeroderma pigmentosum group E gene which is involved in the initiation of nucleotide excision repair via an ubiquitin ligase complex together with DDB1 and CUL4A (cullin 4A). PAQR3 (progestin and adipoQ receptor family member III) is a newly discovered tumour suppressor that is implicated in the development of many types of human cancers. In the present paper, we report that DDB2 is involved in ubiquitination and degradation of PAQR3. DDB2 is able to interact with PAQR3 in vivo and in vitro. Both overexpression and knockdown experiments reveal that the protein expression level, protein stability and polyubiquitination of PAQR3 are changed\nPAQR4 and SKP2 and involved in tumorigenesis. CDK4 is crucial for G1-to-S transition of cell cycle. It is well established that ubiquitin-mediated degradations of CDK inhibitors and cyclins are pivotal for the timely and unidirectional progression of cell cycle. However, how CDK4 itself is modulated by ubiquitin-mediated degradation has been elusive. Here we report that the steady-state level of CDK4 is controlled by PAQR4, a member of the progestin and adipoQ receptor family, and SKP2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Knockdown of PAQR4 leads to reduction of cell proliferation, accompanied by reduced protein level of CDK4. PAQR4 reduces polyubiquitination and degradation of CDK4. PAQR4 interacts with the C-terminal lobe of CDK4. On the other hand, SKP2 also interacts with the C-terminal lobe of CDK4 and enhances polyubiquitination and degradation of CDK4. Importantly, PAQR4 and SKP2 bind to the same region in CDK4, and PAQR4 competes with SKP2 for the binding, thereby\nDiscussion Over the last decade, the genetic backgrounds of cancers have been determined and tumors treated in a tailor made fashion. Remarkable advances in the development of predictive biomarkers and specific targeted small molecule inhibitors have led to improvements in some NSCLC patients' survival rates and quality of life. Unfortunately, there is still no effective biomarker for the majority of NSCLC patients, thus chemotherapy is their first choice treatment option. However, the problem of recurrent drug or chemotherapy resistance remains as a major challenge. In this study (Figure 5G), we identified that PAQR4, a member of the progestin and adipoQ receptor (PAQR) family, and also the closest homologue of PAQR3, is highly expressed in NSCLC cancerous tissues and cell lines. It's knockdown leads to inhibition of cell proliferation, mainly through inducing cellular apoptosis, both in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, we have shown that PAQR4 competes with Keap1 to interact\nconvergent evolution of seven-transmembrane hormone receptors coupled to G proteins. Progestin and AdipoQ Receptor 7, Progesterone Membrane Receptor Component 1 (PGRMC1), and PGRMC2 and Their Role in Regulating Progesterone's Ability to Suppress Human Granulosa/Luteal Cells from Entering into the Cell Cycle. The present studies were designed to determine the role of progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1), PGRMC2, progestin and adipoQ receptor 7 (PAQR7), and progesterone receptor (PGR) in mediating the antimitotic action of progesterone (P4) in human granulosa/luteal cells. For these studies granulosa/luteal cells of 10 women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation were isolated, maintained in culture, and depleted of PGRMC1, PGRMC2, PAQR7, or PGR by siRNA treatment. The rate of entry into the cell cycle was assessed using the FUCCI cell cycle sensor to determine the percentage of cells in the G1/S stage of the cell cycle. PGRMC1, PGRMC2, PAQR7, and PGR mRNA levels were assessed by real-time PCR\nCharacterization, neurosteroid binding and brain distribution of human membrane progesterone receptors \u03b4 and {epsilon} (mPR\u03b4 and mPR{epsilon}) and mPR\u03b4 involvement in neurosteroid inhibition of apoptosis. Three members of the progestin and adipoQ receptor (PAQR) family, PAQR-7, PAQR-8, and PAQR-5 [membrane progesterone (P4) receptor (PR) (mPR)\u03b1, mPR\u03b2, and mPR\u03b3], function as plasma mPRs coupled to G proteins in mammalian cells, but the characteristics of two other members, PAQR6 and PAQR9 (mPR\u03b4 and mPR\u03b5), remain unclear, because they have only been investigated in yeast expression systems. Here, we show that recombinant human mPR\u03b4 and mPR\u03b5 expressed in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells display specific, saturable, high-affinity [(3)H]-P4 binding on the plasma membranes of transfected cells with equilibrium dissociation constants (K(d)s) of 2.71 and 2.85 nm, respectively, and low affinity for R5020, characteristics typical of mPRs. P4 treatment increased cAMP production as well as [(35)S]-guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP)\u03b3S binding to transfected cell membranes, which was\nof the progestin and adipoQ receptor (PAQR) family localized in the Golgi apparatus, to determine their clinical role and mechanism in the development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: The protein expression profile of PAQR4 was examined by IHC using tissue microarrays, and the effects of PAQR4 on cell proliferation, colony formation and xenograft tumor formation were tested in NSCLC cells. Real-time RT-PCR, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and GST-pulldown assays were used to explore the mechanism of action of PAQR4. Results: We provided evidence showing that PAQR4 is increased in NSCLC cancer cell lines (A549, H1299, H1650, H1975, H358, GLC-82 and SPC-A1), and identified many mutations in PAQR4 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues. We demonstrated that PAQR4 high expression correlates with a worse clinical outcome, and that its knockdown suppresses cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis. Importantly, overexpressed PAQR4 physically interacts with Nrf2 in NSCLC cells, blocking the interaction between\nKeap1 and stabilizes Nrf2. Nrf2 then translocates into the nucleus and binds to the ARE (antioxidant response element), activating the transcription of many cytoprotective genes that encode detoxifying enzymes and antioxidant proteins. The induction of these genes confers resistance against xenobiotic and oxidative stresses. Recently, the constitutive stabilization of Nrf2 was found in various human cancers, and cancers with high Nrf2 levels are associated with poor prognosis. Consistently, the role of Nrf2 in determining the efficacy of cisplatin was also demonstrated in ovarian cancer. Moreover, many Keap1 mutations or loss of heterozygosity in the Keap1 locus has been identified in lung cancer. Therefore, identification of new factors involved in Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathways may benefit NSCLC patients with drug resistance in future. We recently used a new method, Cross-Value Association Analysis (CVAA), to analyze the pan-cancer dataset, and identified numerous new differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including Progestin and AdipoQ Receptor 4\ncharacteristics of the seatrout and human progestin membrane receptor alpha subtypes and their evolutionary origins. A novel progestin receptor (mPR) with seven-transmembrane domains was recently discovered in spotted seatrout and homologous genes were identified in other vertebrates. We show that cDNAs for the mPR alpha subtypes from spotted seatrout (st-mPRalpha) and humans (hu-mPRalpha) encode progestin receptors that display many functional characteristics of G protein-coupled receptors. Flow cytometry and immunocytochemical staining of whole MDA-MB-231 cells stably transfected with the mPRalphas using antibodies directed against their N-terminal regions show the receptors are localized on the plasma membrane and suggest the N-terminal domain is extracellular. Both recombinant st-mPRalpha and hu-mPRalpha display high affinity (Kd 4.2-7.8 nm), limited capacity (Bmax 0.03-0.32 nm), and displaceable membrane binding specific for progestins. Progestins activate a pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibitory G protein (G(i)) to down-regulate membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase activity in both st-mPRalpha- and hu-mPRalpha-transfected cells.

PAQR4 is one of these DEGs. It is a member of the PAQR family involved in the regulation of a number of biological processes including metabolism and cancer development. To investigate the potential roles of PAQR4 in tumorigenesis, we examined its expression in various cancer types using gene expression profiling interactive analysis, and found that PAQR4 is highly expressed in many cancer types (Figure S1A; Table 1). In addition, we surveyed PAQR4 protein expression in NSCLC (including lung SCC and ADC) and noncancerous control lung tissues (NCLT) by immunohistochemical staining (IHC) using a tissue microarray (Figure S1B-C; Table 2). The percentage of positive PAQR4 expression was significantly higher in ADC tissues (65.9%) than that in NCLT tissues (40.8%). Furthermore, we found that PAQR4 is upregulated in both lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous\ninducing cellular apoptosis, both in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, we have shown that PAQR4 competes with Keap1 to interact with and to inhibit Nrf2 protein degradation. This activity is different from the adaptive role of PAQR3 facilitating Keap1-Nrf2 complex formation and protein degradation, and decreased expression of PAQR3 in NSCLC can also lead to chemoresistance by increasing Nrf2 stability. Consistent with this finding, we identified that PAQR3 is decreased in NSCLC. Furthermore, PAQR4 knockdown promotes the sensitivity of cancerous cell to DDP/ Paclitaxel treatment through decreasing Nrf2 protein levels. The underlying mechanism of why PAQR4 behaves differently from PAQR3 in NSCLC is still unknown, and deciphering the expression regulation of these two family members under different cellular or tissue context might be able to resolve this mystery. For example, the promoter methylation levels or transcriptional regulation mechanisms may be different.

Due to the higher expression of PAQR4 in NSCLC cancerous cell lines we hypothesized that PAQR4 might also be frequently mutated in NSCLC. Indeed, we identified many PAQR4 mutants in NSCLC by applying the cBioPortal web resource (Figure 1D; Table 3-4), suggesting that PAQR4 plays potential important role in lung homeostasis. PAQR4 knockdown inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation and induces cellular apoptosis NSCLC cell lines SPC-A1 and GLC-82 were chosen to further validate the functional roles of PAQR4. We inhibited PAQR4 mRNA expression with two lenti-viral shRNAs (Materials and Methods), and verified the inhibition efficiency by real-time RT-PCR (Figure 1F-G). As expected, stable knockdown of PAQR4 inhibited SPC-A1 and GLC-82 cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro, and this effect could be rescued by PAQR4 overexpression (Figure 1H-J and Figure S1D, E, I, J). Indeed, we observed that PAQR4 knockdown significantly decreased the ratio of BrdU-positive cells in SPC-A1 and\nassays Cells were plated into 96-well plates with 1\u00d7104 cells per well and cultured overnight, indicated drugs were added. Cell viabilities were detected by sulforhodamine B (SRB) staining following a standard protocol. The assay was repeated in triplicate. Cells were plated into 6 cm culture dishes with 5\u00d7105 cells per dish and cultured overnight, indicated drugs were added for 48 h. The apoptotic cell numbers were analyzed by flow cytometry. Indicated cell lysates were detect by antibodies against apoptotic markers by western blot. Immunofluorescence and Immunohistochemistry staining To detect the co-localization of PAQR4 with Nrf2 or Keap1, indicated constructs were transfected into SPC-A1 cells, and the cells were seeded into 8-well plates with 5\u00d7104 cells per well. 48 h after transfection, indicated cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, permeated with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, followed by primary and secondary antibody staining.

In a preliminary study, serum antibodies against purified sarcalumenin were detected in 40% of patients with active TAO of less than 1 year duration, but in no controls tested. We porpose that the primary autoantigen in TAO is G2s, which would also explain the association of ophthalmopathy with thyroid autoimmunity, and that antibodies against the intracellular proteins flavoprotein, calsequestrin, and sarcalumenin are secondary markers of an immune-mediated reaction in eye muscle in patients with thyroid autoimmunity. Sarcalumenin is essential for maintaining cardiac function during endurance exercise training. Sarcalumenin (SAR), a Ca(2+)-binding protein located in the longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), regulates Ca(2+) reuptake into the SR by interacting with cardiac sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase 2a (SERCA2a). We have previously demonstrated that SAR deficiency induced progressive heart failure in\nmice. Sarcalumenin is a Ca2+-binding protein located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of striated muscle cells, the physiological function of which has not been fully determined yet. Using sarcalumenin knockout (sar(-/-)) mice, we showed that sar ablation altered store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) and enhanced muscle fatigue resistance. Sar(-/-) mice fatigued less with treadmill exercise, and intact isolated soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles from sar(-/-) mice were more resistant to intermittent fatiguing stimulation than those from wild-type mice. Enhanced SOCE was observed in the sar(-/-) muscles. Biochemical analysis revealed that sar(-/-) muscles contained significantly elevated expression of mitsugumin 29 (MG29), a synaptophysin-related membrane protein located in the triad junction of skeletal muscle. Because the ablation of mg29 has been shown to cause increased fatigability and dysfunction of SOCE, the enhanced SOCE activity seen in sar(-/-) muscle may be correlated with the increased expression of MG29. Our data suggest that systemic ablation\ncomponent triadin, the 53 kDa sarcoplasmic reticulum glycoprotein, as well as the dihydropyridine receptor increased in abundance, while no major changes in the expression of the ryanodine receptor were observed. Crosslinking analysis revealed that the fast Ca2+-ATPase, alpha1-dihydropyridine receptor and calsequestrin exhibit a more pronounced tendency to oligomerise in adult muscle fibres as compared to early postnatal stages. Interestingly, adult calsequestrin exists not only as a 63 kDa form but also as stable molecular species of higher molecular mass. These findings imply that during postnatal development, protein-protein interactions within the Ca2+-regulatory membrane system become more complex and oligomerisation appears to be an essential prerequisite for the proper physiological functioning of key membrane proteins in matured skeletal muscle fibres. Enhanced resistance to fatigue and altered calcium handling properties of sarcalumenin knockout mice. Sarcalumenin is a Ca2+-binding protein located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of striated muscle cells, the physiological function of which\nDrastic reduction of sarcalumenin in Dp427 (dystrophin of 427 kDa)-deficient fibres indicates that abnormal calcium handling plays a key role in muscular dystrophy. Although the primary abnormality in dystrophin is the underlying cause for mdx (X-chromosome-linked muscular dystrophy), abnormal Ca2+ handling after sarcolemmal microrupturing appears to be the pathophysiological mechanism leading to muscle weakness. To develop novel pharmacological strategies for eliminating Ca2+-dependent proteolysis, it is crucial to determine the fate of Ca2+-handling proteins in dystrophin-deficient fibres. In the present study, we show that a key luminal Ca2+-binding protein SAR (sarcalumenin) is affected in mdx skeletal-muscle fibres. One- and two-dimensional immunoblot analyses revealed the relative expression of the 160 kDa SR (sarcoplasmic reticulum) protein to be approx. 70% lower in mdx fibres when compared with normal skeletal muscles. This drastic reduction in SAR was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Patchy internal labelling of SAR in dystrophic fibres suggests an abnormal formation of\nof cardiac stress in SARKO mice after training. After training, expression levels of SERCA2a protein were significantly downregulated by 30% in SARKO hearts, whereas they were significantly upregulated by 59% in WT hearts. Consequently, SERCA2 activity was significantly decreased in SARKO hearts after training. Furthermore, the expression levels of other Ca(2+)-handling proteins, including phospholamban, ryanodine receptor 2, calsequestrin 2, and sodium/calcium exchanger 1, were significantly decreased in SARKO hearts after training. These results indicate that SAR plays a critical role in maintaining cardiac function under physiological stresses, such as endurance exercise, by regulating Ca(2+) transport activity into the SR. SAR may be a primary target for exercise-related adaptation of the Ca(2+) storage system in the SR to preserve cardiac function. Sarcalumenin alleviates stress-induced cardiac dysfunction by improving Ca2+ handling of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. AIMS: Sarcalumenin (SAR) is a Ca(2+)-binding protein expressed in the longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of striated muscle\nactivity seen in sar(-/-) muscle may be correlated with the increased expression of MG29. Our data suggest that systemic ablation of sarcalumenin caused enhanced resistance to muscle fatigue by compensatory changes in Ca2+ regulatory proteins that effect SOCE. Role of the eye muscles in thyroid eye disease: identification of the principal autoantigens. Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is a progressive orbital disorder associated with Graves' hyperthyroidism and, less often, Hashimoto's thyroiditis in which autoantibodies react with orbital antigens and lead to exophthalmos and eye muscle inflammation. Eye muscle (EM) membrane proteins initially reported as 55 and 64 kd are the best markers of ophthalmopathy. The \"64-kd protein\" is now shown to be the flavoprotein subunit of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase and to have a correct molecular weight of 67 kd. We have cloned a fragment of a novel eye muscle protein, which we call G2s, and sequenced 1.4 kb of the full length\na fragment of a novel eye muscle protein, which we call G2s, and sequenced 1.4 kb of the full length cDNA. G2s does not share any significant homologies with other reported proteins. The 5.9 kb G2s mRNA, that corresponds to a protein of approximately 220 kd, is expressed in EM, other skeletal muscle and thyroid, but not in other tissues tested. We have also cloned and sequenced a 63-kd eye muscle protein identified as the calcium binding protein calsequestrin. Antibodies against calsequestrin were found in 40% of patients with active ophthalmopathy, but in 0% of normal subjects. Finally, we have sequenced a 19 amino acid fragment of a 55-kd porcine eye muscle membrane protein that exactly matched porcine and human sarcalumenin, a 160-kd glycoprotein localized in the lumen of the longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum of the skeletal muscle fiber where it binds calcium. A 53-kd glycoprotein fragment of the molecule corresponds\nThis confirms the idea that abnormal Ca2+ cycling is involved in Ca2+-induced myonecrosis. Hence, manipulating disturbed Ca2+ handling might represent new modes of abolishing proteolytic degradation in muscular dystrophy. Oligomerisation of Ca2+-regulatory membrane components involved in the excitation-contraction-relaxation cycle during postnatal development of rabbit skeletal muscle. The skeletal muscle excitation-contraction-relaxation cycle matures during the first weeks after birth and protein-protein interactions are believed to be essential for proper Ca2+ regulation. We therefore studied potential changes in the oligomerisation of key components of the Ca2+-regulatory membrane system during postnatal myogenesis. In contrast to a decrease in calreticulin, the Ca2+-binding proteins calsequestrin and sarcalumenin increased in abundance in microsomes isolated from muscle between postnatal days 1 and 41. While the expression of the fast Ca2+-ATPase increased, its slow-twitch isoform decreased. The junctional component triadin, the 53 kDa sarcoplasmic reticulum glycoprotein, as well as the dihydropyridine receptor increased in abundance, while no major\nthe sarcoplasmic reticulum. AIMS: Sarcalumenin (SAR) is a Ca(2+)-binding protein expressed in the longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of striated muscle cells. Although its Ca(2+)-binding property is similar to that of calsequestrin, its role in the regulation of Ca(2+) cycling remains unclear.METHODS AND RESULTS: To investigate whether SAR plays an important role in maintaining cardiac function under pressure overload stress, SAR-knockout (SAR-KO) mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC). To examine the relation of SAR with cardiac type of SR Ca(2+) pump, SERCA2a, we designed cDNA expression using cultured cells. We found that SAR expression was significantly downregulated in hypertrophic hearts from three independent animal models. SAR-KO mice experienced higher mortality than did wild-type (WT) mice after TAC. TAC significantly downregulated SERCA2a protein but not mRNA in the SAR-KO hearts, whereas it minimally did so in hearts from WT mice. Accordingly, SR Ca(2+) uptake and cardiac function were significantly reduced\nin SAR was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Patchy internal labelling of SAR in dystrophic fibres suggests an abnormal formation of SAR domains. Differential co-immunoprecipitation experiments and chemical cross-linking demonstrated a tight linkage between SAR and the SERCA1 (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic-reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 1) isoform of the SR Ca2+-ATPase. However, the relative expression of the fast Ca2+ pump was not decreased in dystrophic membrane preparations. This implies that the reduction in SAR and calsequestrin-like proteins plays a central role in the previously reported impairment of Ca2+ buffering in the dystrophic SR [Culligan, Banville, Dowling and Ohlendieck (2002) J. Appl. Physiol. 92, 435-445]. Impaired Ca2+ shuttling between the Ca2+-uptake SERCA units and calsequestrin clusters via SAR, as well as an overall decreased luminal ion-binding capacity, might indirectly amplify the Ca2+-leak-channel-induced increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels. This confirms the idea that abnormal Ca2+ cycling is involved in Ca2+-induced myonecrosis. Hence, manipulating disturbed Ca2+ handling might represent\ninteracting with cardiac sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase 2a (SERCA2a). We have previously demonstrated that SAR deficiency induced progressive heart failure in response to pressure overload, despite mild cardiac dysfunction in sham-operated SAR knockout (SARKO) mice (26). Since responses to physiological stresses often differ from those to pathological stresses, we examined the effects of endurance exercise on cardiac function in SARKO mice. Wild-type (WT) and SARKO mice were subjected to endurance treadmill exercise training ( approximately 65% of maximal exercise ability for 60 min/day) for 12 wk. After exercise training, maximal exercise ability was significantly increased by 5% in WT mice (n = 6), whereas it was significantly decreased by 37% in SARKO mice (n = 5). Cardiac function assessed by echocardiographic examination was significantly decreased in accordance with upregulation of biomarkers of cardiac stress in SARKO mice after training. After training, expression levels of SERCA2a protein were significantly downregulated by 30%\nwhereas it minimally did so in hearts from WT mice. Accordingly, SR Ca(2+) uptake and cardiac function were significantly reduced in SAR-KO mice after TAC. Then we found that SAR was co-immunoprecipitated with SERCA2a in cDNA-transfected HEK293T cells and mouse ventricular muscles, and that SERCA2a-mediated Ca(2+) uptake was augmented when SAR was co-expressed in HEK293T cells. Furthermore, SAR significantly prolonged the half-life of SERCA2a protein in HEK293T cells.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that functional interaction between SAR and SERCA2a enhances protein stability of SERCA2a and facilitates Ca(2+) sequestration into the SR. Thus the SAR-SERCA2a interaction plays an essential role in preserving cardiac function under biomechanical stresses such as pressure overload.",

The Biogenesis of Lysosome-Related Organelles Complex 1 (BLOC-1) is a protein complex containing the schizophrenia susceptibility factor dysbindin, which is encoded by the gene DTNBP1. However, mechanisms engaged by dysbindin defining schizophrenia susceptibility pathways have not been quantitatively elucidated. Here, we discovered prevalent and novel cellular roles of the BLOC-1 complex in neuronal cells by performing large-scale Stable Isotopic Labeling of Cells in Culture (SILAC) quantitative proteomics combined with genetic analyses in dysbindin-null mice (Mus musculus) and the genome of schizophrenia patients. We identified 24 proteins that associate with the BLOC-1 complex, many of which were altered in content/distribution in cells or tissues deficient in BLOC-1. New findings include BLOC-1 interactions with the COG complex, a Golgi apparatus tether, and antioxidant enzymes peroxiredoxins 1-2.

Dysbindin (also known as dysbindin-1 or dystrobrevin-binding protein 1) was identified 10 years ago as a ubiquitously expressed protein of unknown function. In the following years, the protein and its encoding gene, DTNBP1, have become the focus of intensive research owing to genetic and histopathological evidence suggesting a potential role in\nis also sorted to lysosomes after endocytosis. Dysbindin was not required for lysosomal trafficking of all signaling receptors, however, as its depletion did not detectably affect down-regulation of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Dysbindin co-immunoprecipitated with GASP-1 (or GPRASP-1), a cytoplasmic protein shown previously to modulate lysosomal trafficking of D2 dopamine and delta opioid receptors by direct interaction, and with HRS that is a core component of the conserved ESCRT machinery mediating lysosome biogenesis and sorting.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results identify a distinct, and potentially widespread function of dysbindin in promoting the sorting of specific GPCRs to lysosomes after endocytosis. Dysbindin, a novel coiled-coil-containing protein that interacts with the dystrobrevins in muscle and brain. The dystrophin-associated protein complex (DPC) is required for the maintenance of muscle integrity during the mechanical stresses of contraction and relaxation. In addition to providing a membrane scaffold, members of the DPC such as the alpha-dystrobrevin protein family\ncontraction and relaxation. In addition to providing a membrane scaffold, members of the DPC such as the alpha-dystrobrevin protein family are thought to play an important role in intracellular signal transduction. To gain additional insights into the function of the DPC, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen for dystrobrevin-interacting proteins. Here we describe the identification of a dysbindin, a novel dystrobrevin-binding protein. Dysbindin is an evolutionary conserved 40-kDa coiled-coil-containing protein that binds to alpha- and beta-dystrobrevin in muscle and brain. Dystrophin and alpha-dystrobrevin are co-immunoprecipitated with dysbindin, indicating that dysbindin is DPC-associated in muscle. Dysbindin co-localizes with alpha-dystrobrevin at the sarcolemma and is up-regulated in dystrophin-deficient muscle. In the brain, dysbindin is found primarily in axon bundles and especially in certain axon terminals, notably mossy fiber synaptic terminals in the cerebellum and hippocampus. These findings have implications for the molecular pathology of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and may provide an alternative\nthat dysbindin is a potent inducer of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via activation of Rho-dependent serum-response factor (SRF) signaling. We have now performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using dysbindin as bait against a cardiac cDNA library to identify the cardiac dysbindin interactome. Among several putative binding proteins, we identified tripartite motif-containing protein 24 (TRIM24) and confirmed this interaction by co-immunoprecipitation and co-immunostaining. Another tripartite motif (TRIM) family protein, TRIM32, has been reported earlier as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for dysbindin in skeletal muscle. Consistently, we found that TRIM32 also degraded dysbindin in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes as well. Surprisingly, however, TRIM24 did not promote dysbindin decay but rather protected dysbindin against degradation by TRIM32. Correspondingly, TRIM32 attenuated the activation of SRF signaling and hypertrophy due to dysbindin, whereas TRIM24 promoted these effects in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. This study also implies that TRIM32 is a key regulator of cell viability and apoptosis\ninclude BLOC-1 interactions with the COG complex, a Golgi apparatus tether, and antioxidant enzymes peroxiredoxins 1-2. Importantly, loci encoding eight of the 24 proteins are affected by genomic copy number variation in schizophrenia patients. Thus, our quantitative proteomic studies expand the functional repertoire of the BLOC-1 complex and provide insight into putative molecular pathways of schizophrenia susceptibility. Reinvestigation of the dysbindin subunit of BLOC-1 (biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1) as a dystrobrevin-binding protein. Dysbindin was identified as a dystrobrevin-binding protein potentially involved in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy. Subsequently, genetic studies have implicated variants of the human dysbindin-encoding gene, DTNBP1, in the pathogeneses of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and schizophrenia. The protein is a stable component of a multisubunit complex termed BLOC-1 (biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1). In the present study, the significance of the dystrobrevin-dysbindin interaction for BLOC-1 function was examined. Yeast two-hybrid analyses, and binding assays using recombinant proteins, demonstrated\nfor both the proper perinuclear localization of myospryn, as well as the proper positioning of lysosomes, thus suggesting a potential role of desmin intermediate filaments in lysosomes and lysosome-related organelle biogenesis and/or positioning. Myospryn is a novel binding partner for dysbindin in muscle. Dysbindin is a coiled-coil-containing protein that was initially identified in a screen for dystrobrevin-interacting proteins. Recently, dysbindin has been shown to be involved in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles and is also a major schizophrenia susceptibility factor. Although dysbindin has been implicated in a number of different cellular processes, little is known about its function. To determine the function of dysbindin in muscle, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify potential interacting proteins. Here we show that dysbindin binds to a novel 413-kDa protein, myospryn, which is expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle.

Indeed, DPC is necessary for maturation and function of a subset of inhibitory synapses. Lack of dystrophin in the mdx mouse model of DMD produces an altered distribution of dysbindin in the brain, suggesting a role for dysbindin-1 in the cognitive impairment observed in DMD patients.

Postmortem brains of patients with mental diseases from the Stanley Research Medical Institute's Consortium Collection were used to demonstrate molecular interactions in biochemically purified protein fractions.RESULTS: First, upon overexpression in neuroblastoma cells, DISC1 formed aggresomes that recruited homologous soluble C-terminal DISC1 fragment or heterologous dysbindin. Domains involved in binding could be mapped to DISC1 (316-597) and dysbindin (82-173), indicating a specific interaction. In addition, recruitment was demonstrated when externally added, purified DISC1 aggresomes penetrated recipient cells after coincubation. Second, a direct interaction between soluble DISC1 protein and dysbindin was demonstrated in a cell free system using E. coli-expressed proteins. Third, co-aggregation of DISC1 and dysbindin was demonstrated in postmortem brains for a subgroup of cases with chronic mental disease but not healthy control subjects.CONCLUSIONS: A direct interaction of soluble and insoluble DISC1 protein with dysbindin protein demonstrates convergence of so far considered independent mental disease genes by direct\ncerebellum and hippocampus. These findings have implications for the molecular pathology of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and may provide an alternative route for anchoring dystrobrevin and the DPC to the muscle membrane. Proper perinuclear localization of the TRIM-like protein myospryn requires its binding partner desmin. Desmin, the muscle-specific intermediate filament protein, surrounds the Z disks and links the entire contractile apparatus to the sarcolemmal cytoskeleton, cytoplasmic organelles, and the nucleus. In an attempt to explore the molecular mechanisms of these associations, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening of a cardiac cDNA library. We showed that the desmin amino-terminal domain (N-(1-103)) binds to a 413-kDa TRIM-like protein, myospryn, originally identified as the muscle-specific partner of dysbindin, a component of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1). Binding of desmin with myospryn was confirmed with glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Western blot analysis revealed that the complex immunoprecipitated by desmin\nfrom a population-representative longitudinal study Gene dosage in the dysbindin schizophrenia susceptibility network differentially affects synaptic function and plasticity Reinvestigation of the dysbindin subunit of BLOC-1 (biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1) as a dystrobrevin-binding protein Evidence of novel neuronal functions of dysbindin, a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia Closing the translational gap between mutant mouse models and the clinical reality of psychotic illness Schizophrenia Dysbindin-1, a schizophrenia-related protein, functionally interacts with the DNA-dependent protein kinase complex in an isoform-dependent manner Dysbindin-1 modulates prefrontal cortical activity and schizophrenia-like behaviors via dopamine/D2 pathways Epistatic interaction between COMT and DTNBP1 modulates prefrontal function in mice and in humans Comprehensive analysis of tagging sequence variants in DTNBP1 shows no association with schizophrenia or with its composite neurocognitive endophenotypes Dysregulation of specialized delay/interference-dependent working memory following loss of dysbindin-1A in schizophrenia-related phenotypes Effect of bumetanide, a selective NKCC1 inhibitor, on hallucinations of schizophrenic patients; a double-blind\nwith neurodevelopmental disorder gene defects.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The mechanisms associated with schizophrenia are mostly unknown despite the increasing number of genetic loci identified that increase disease risk. We present an experimental strategy that impartially and comprehensively interrogates the proteome of neurons to identify effects of genetic mutations in a schizophrenia risk factor, dysbindin. We find that the expression of the actin polymerization complex Arp2/3 is reduced in dysbindin-deficient cells, thus affecting actin-dependent phenotypes in two cellular compartments where dysbindin resides, endosomes and presynapses. Our studies indicate that a central cellular structure affected by schizophrenia susceptibility loci is the actin cytoskeleton, an organelle necessary for synaptic function in the presynaptic and postsynaptic compartment. TRIM24 protein promotes and TRIM32 protein inhibits cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via regulation of dysbindin protein levels. We have previously shown that dysbindin is a potent inducer of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via activation of Rho-dependent serum-response factor (SRF) signaling. We have now\nfor pallidin and snapin, and at least part of the muted-binding interface. Functional, histological and immunohistochemical analyses failed to detect any sign of muscle pathology in BLOC-1-deficient, homozygous pallid mice. Taken together, these results suggest that dysbindin assembled into BLOC-1 is not a physiological binding partner of the dystrobrevins, likely due to engagement of its dystrobrevin-binding region in interactions with other subunits. Dysbindin promotes the post-endocytic sorting of G protein-coupled receptors to lysosomes. BACKGROUND: Dysbindin, a cytoplasmic protein long known to function in the biogenesis of specialized lysosome-related organelles (LROs), has been reported to reduce surface expression of D2 dopamine receptors in neurons. Dysbindin is broadly expressed, and dopamine receptors are members of the large family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that function in diverse cell types. Thus we asked if dysbindin regulates receptor number in non-neural cells, and further investigated the cellular basis of this regulation.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used\nhighly investigated schizophrenia-risk genes. Accumulating evidence suggests that dysbindin plays an important role in the regulation of neuroplasticity. Dysbindin was reported to be a stable component of BLOC-1 complex in the cytosol. However, little is known about the endogenous dysbindin-containing complex in the brain synaptosome. In this study, we investigated the associated proteome of dysbindin in the P2 synaptosome fraction of mouse brain. Our data suggest that dysbindin has three isoforms associating with different complexes in the P2 fraction of mouse brain. To facilitate immunopurification, BAC transgenic mice expressing a tagged dysbindin were generated, and 47 putative dysbindin-associated proteins, including all components of BLOC-1, were identified by mass spectrometry in the dysbindin-containing complex purified from P2. The interactions of several selected candidates, including WDR11, FAM91A1, snapin, muted, pallidin, and two proteasome subunits, PSMD9 and PSMA4, were verified by coimmunoprecipitation.

In addition, heterodimerization is crucially involved in initiation of the serotonin-mediated 5-HT(1A) receptor internalization and also enhances the ability of the 5-HT(1A) receptor to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinases. Finally, we found that production of 5-HT(7) receptors in the hippocampus continuously decreases during postnatal development, indicating that the relative concentration of 5-HT(1A)-5-HT(7) heterodimers and, consequently, their functional importance undergoes pronounced developmental changes. Constitutive Gs-mediated, but not G12-mediated, activity of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT7(a) receptor is modulated by the palmitoylation of its C-terminal domain. The 5-HT(7) receptor is the most recently described member of the serotonin receptor family. This receptor is mainly expressed in the thalamus, hypothalamus as well as in the hippocampus and cortex. In the present study, we demonstrate that the mouse 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT(7(a)) receptor undergoes post-translational modification\nHeterodimerization of serotonin receptors 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 differentially regulates receptor signalling and trafficking. Serotonin receptors 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(7) are highly coexpressed in brain regions implicated in depression. However, their functional interaction has not been established. In the present study we show that 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(7) receptors form heterodimers both in vitro and in vivo. Foerster resonance energy transfer-based assays revealed that, in addition to heterodimers, homodimers composed either of 5-HT(1A) or 5-HT(7) receptors together with monomers coexist in cells. The highest affinity for complex formation was obtained for the 5-HT(7)-5-HT(7) homodimers, followed by the 5-HT(7)-5-HT(1A) heterodimers and 5-HT(1A)-5-HT(1A) homodimers. Functionally, heterodimerization decreases 5-HT(1A)-receptor-mediated activation of G(i) protein without affecting 5-HT(7)-receptor-mediated signalling. Moreover, heterodimerization markedly decreases the ability of the 5-HT(1A) receptor to activate G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels in a heterologous system. The inhibitory effect on such channels was also preserved in hippocampal neurons, demonstrating a physiological relevance of heteromerization\nin the hippocampus and cortex. In the present study, we demonstrate that the mouse 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT(7(a)) receptor undergoes post-translational modification by the palmitate, which is covalently attached to the protein through a thioester-type bond. Analysis of protein-bound fatty acids revealed that the 5-HT(7(a)) receptor predominantly contains palmitic acid. Labelling experiments performed in the presence of agonists show that the 5-HT(7(a)) receptor is dynamically palmitoylated in an agonist-dependent manner and that previously synthesized receptors may be subjected to repeated cycles of palmitoylation/depalmitoylation. Mutation analysis revealed that cysteine residues 404 and 438/441 located in the C-terminal receptor domain are the main palmitoylation sites responsible for the attachment of 90% of the receptor-bound palmitate. Analysis of acylation-deficient mutants revealed that non-palmitoylated 5-HT(7(a)) receptors were indistinguishable from the wild-type for their ability to interact with G(s)- and G(12)-proteins after agonist stimulation.

However, mutation of the proximal palmitoylation site Cys404-Ser (either alone or in combination with Cys438/441-Ser) significantly increased the agonist-independent, G(s)-mediated constitutive 5-HT(7(a)) receptor activity, while the activation of Galpha(12)-protein was not affected. This demonstrates a functional importance of 5-HT(7(a)) dynamic palmitoylation for the fine tuning of receptor-mediated signaling. HTR7 mediates serotonergic acute and chronic itch SUMMARY Chronic itch is a prevalent and debilitating condition for which few effective therapies are available. We harnessed the natural variation across genetically distinct mouse strains to identify transcripts co-regulated with itch behavior. This survey led to the discovery of the serotonin receptor, HTR7, as a key mediator of serotonergic itch. Activation of HTR7 promoted opening of the ion channel TRPA1, which in turn triggered itch behaviors. In addition, acute itch triggered by serotonin or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor required both HTR7 and TRPA1.

Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) is an important neurotransmitter regulating a wide range of physiological and pathological functions via activation of heterogeneously expressed 5-HT receptors. Besides the important role of 5-HT receptors in the pathogenesis of depressive disorders and in their clinical medications, underlying mechanisms are far from being completely understood. This review focuses on possible cross talk between two serotonin receptors, 5-HT1A and the 5-HT7 .

Micromolar 5-HT concentrations triggered itch but not pain behaviors, while millimolar concentrations triggered both itch and pain. Most experimental analyses of 5-HT-evoked behavior have used millimolar concentrations (1\u201394 mM), which are significantly higher than the 5-HT levels measured in chronic itch conditions and thus may not target physiologically relevant sites and 5-HT receptor subtypes. Our results make clear that HTR7 is required for itch behaviors evoked by 5-HT at 100\u03bcM, but not for itch and pain at 1mM concentrations. These findings suggest that HTR7 may be preferentially activated by low 5-HT levels, which dovetail with studies showing that HTR7 has the highest affinity for 5-HT among HTR family members. A role for HTR7 in only a subset of 5-HT-evoked behaviors under particular conditions, rather than all 5-HT responses, is not surprising given that many 5-HT receptors are expressed in\nand pain. Indeed, in humans, aberrant 5-HT signaling in the skin is linked to itch in atopic dermatitis, as well as in other disorders including allergy, uremia, cholestasis, and psoriasis. Although numerous studies have highlighted the importance of 5-HT in acute and chronic itch, the 5-HT receptor subtypes that transduce serotonergic itch signals have remained enigmatic. Here, we examined itch behaviors and sensory neuron gene expression across genetically distinct mouse strains. We observed a correlation between acute itch behavior and expression of the 5-HT receptor, HTR7. This first clue to the function of HTR7 in the periphery served as motivation for an extensive characterization of its role in serotonergic and chronic itch. We found that HTR7 is expressed in a subset of primary afferent sensory neurons that innervate the skin and promote acute itch but not pain behaviors.

Pharmacological studies have also implicated peripheral HTR2a, HTR2b and HTR3 receptors, and central HTR1a receptors in itch, but to date there has been no genetic evidence for any 5-HT receptor in transducing serotonergic itch signals in primary afferent neurons. We have used genetic and pharmacological tools to show that HTR7 plays a selective role in acute serotonergic and atopic dermatitis itch, but not pain. Our results augment the previous characterization of HTR7 in the CNS in circadian rhythm function, central thermoregulation, neuroendocrine function, migraine and antinociception. HTR7 mediates acute serotonergic itch Our data implicate HTR7 as a key component of the 5-HT itch pathway.

Schematic diagram depicting the putative roles of HTR7 and TRPA1 signaling in acute and chronic itch Model by which increased 5-HT levels in the skin, triggered by direct injection of 5-HT, SSRI administration or atopic dermatitis activates the 5-HT receptor, HTR7. HTR7 in turn signals to adenylate cyclase via G\u03b1 and G\u03b2\u03b3, to open TRPA1 ion channels, neuronal depolarization, action potential firing and ultimately trigger itch-evoked scratching. HIGHLIGHTS Activation of peripheral HTR7 receptors triggers itch but not pain behaviors HTR7 promotes opening of the inflammatory ion\nNo significant differences in itch behavior or lesion severity were observed between Htr7+/+ and Trpa1+/+ wild-type animals of each strain and thus we combined all data for comparison to knockout animals. Previous studies have implicated HTR7 in immune cell signaling which may contribute to 5-HT release in the skin; in the AD model, we found that 5-HT levels in eczematous skin isolated from Htr7\u2212/\u2212 and Trpa1\u2212/\u2212 mice were indistinguishable from those of wild-type mice (Figure 6C, red). Thus, HTR7 and TRPA1 are not required for the release of 5-HT in atopic dermatitis skin. Taken together, our data identify HTR7 and TRPA1 as key molecular determinants of atopic dermatitis (Figure 7). DISCUSSION In this work, we have taken advantage of natural variation in itch behavior in mice and gene expression to identify novel molecular determinants of itch in primary afferent sensory neurons. Many of the genes that we have found to\nthat includes secretion of the atopic dermatitis cytokine, TSLP, immune cell infiltration, skin hyperplasia, and the development of eczematous lesions. However, several additional hallmarks of human atopic dermatitis (AD), including high 5-HT levels in the skin and intense itch-evoked scratching, have yet to be quantified in this mouse model. To further validate this mouse model of human atopic dermatitis, we used a treatment course of 7 consecutive days of topical application of MC903 to the mouse cheek, and monitored itch behaviors for a total of 12 days; we also measured 5-HT levels and skin lesion severity immediately following the final treatment. Consistent with previous reports, we found that wild-type mice treated with MC903 developed eczematous-like lesions that worsened over time in redness (erythema), dryness (xerosis) and scabbing (excoriation; Figure 6A and 6B). As is true for human atopic dermatitis patients, we found that MC903-treated mice displayed high levels of 5-HT\nsomatosensory and cell signaling categories, including 5-HT signaling (Table S2). HTR7 is a candidate itch transducer Among the top transcriptional correlates of chloroquine itch, we noted two 5-HT receptors, HTR7 and HTR1d. 5-HT has long been linked to chronic itch and pain, and somatosensory neurons express ten distinct subtypes of 5-HT receptors with the exact role of each subtype in somatosensation yet to be defined. We thus singled out for functional characterization Htr7, the receptor whose expression was most highly correlated with itch behavior (Figure 1B). Htr7 expression was 2-fold higher in the most sensitive progeny strain than in the least responsive progeny (Figure 2A), and 1.3-fold higher in the more itch-prone DBA parental strain than in BL6 (BL6 = 1031.67 \u00b1 78.19 reads, DBA = 1305.00 \u00b1 18.19 reads; p < 0.05; n = 3 mice/strain). HTR7 is expressed and functional in sensory neurons that innervate the skin Somatosensory\nidentify novel molecular determinants of itch in primary afferent sensory neurons. Many of the genes that we have found to be co-regulated with itch behavior have already been implicated in somatosensation, including Htr1d, Scn8a, and Ano1. However, a number of novel genes were also identified, many of which may represent new candidate itch transducers. We focused on the 5-HT receptor, HTR7, and established its role as a key transducer of serotonergic acute and chronic itch. In the periphery, 5-HT can act as an algogen to trigger acute pain or pain hypersensitivity, a pruritogen to trigger itch-evoked scratching, rash or wheal, or in some cases, both itch and pain. A variety of 5-HT receptor subtypes are expressed in primary afferent sensory neurons, with HTR1-3 being the best studied. Pharmacological and genetic ablation studies have shown that HTR1a, HTR1b, HTR2a, HTR2b and HTR3a mediate some forms of acute and inflammatory pain transmission.",

The amino acid sequence of mLV1 was 96 % identical to a Kir channel cloned from human kidney (hKir4.2), and approximately 60 % identical to the Kir4.1 channel cloned from human and rat, so that mLV1 was classified as mKir4.2. 2. Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNA encoding mKir4.2 displayed a large inwardly rectifying K+ current, while control oocytes injected with H2O displayed no similar K+ current. The current was blocked by Ba2+ and Cs+ in a voltage-dependent fashion and displayed inward rectification that was intermediate between that of the strong inward rectifier Kir2.1 and the weak inward rectifier Kir1.1. The current was weakly blocked by TEA in a voltage-independent fashion. 3. mKir4.2 current was subject to modulation by several distinct mechanisms. Intracellular acidification decreased mKir4.2 current in a reversible fashion,\nfunctional channels in Xenopus oocytes, that these Kir channels display novel properties, and that Kir4.2 subunits may be responsible for physiological modulation of functional Kir channels. Tamoxifen inhibits inward rectifier K+ 2.x family of inward rectifier channels by interfering with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-channel interactions. Tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor antagonist used in the treatment of breast cancer, inhibits the inward rectifier potassium current (I(K1)) in cardiac myocytes by an unknown mechanism. We characterized the inhibitory effects of tamoxifen on Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3 potassium channels that underlie cardiac I(K1). We also studied the effects of 4-hydroxytamoxifen and raloxifene. All three drugs inhibited inward rectifier K(+) 2.x (Kir2.x) family members. The order of inhibition for all three drugs was Kir2.3 > Kir2.1 approximately Kir2.2. The onset of inhibition of Kir2.x current by these compounds was slow (T(1/2) approximately 6 min) and only partially recovered after washout ( approximately 30%). Kir2.x inhibition was concentration-dependent\n(vi) Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed interaction between the N- and C-terminal intracellular domains of different Kir2.x subunits. Coexpression of Kir2.1 mutants related to Andersen's syndrome with wild-type Kir2.x channels showed a dominant negative effect, the extent of which varied between different mutants. Our results suggest that differential tetramerization of the mutant allele of Kir2.1 with wild-type Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3 channels represents the molecular basis of the extraordinary pleiotropy of Andersen's syndrome. Expression of a functional Kir4 family inward rectifier K+ channel from a gene cloned from mouse liver. 1. A low stringency polymerase chain reaction (PCR) homology screening procedure was used to probe a mouse liver cDNA library to identify novel inward rectifier K+ channel genes. A single gene (mLV1) was identified that exhibited extensive sequence homology with previously cloned inward rectifier K+ channel genes. The mLV1 gene showed greatest sequence identity with genes belonging to the Kir4 subfamily.\nIdentification of G protein-coupled, inward rectifier potassium channel gene products from the rat anterior pituitary gland. Dopamine (DA) is a physiological regulator of PRL secretion, exerting tonic inhibitory control. DA activates an inward rectifier K(+) (IRK) channel in rat lactotropes, causing membrane hyperpolarization and inhibition of Ca(2+)-dependent action potentials. Both the activation of this effector K(+) channel and the inhibition of PRL release are mediated by D(2)-type receptor activation and pertussis toxin- sensitive G proteins. To study the molecular basis of this physiologically relevant channel, a homology-based PCR approach was employed to identify members of the IRK channel family expressed in the anterior pituitary gland. Nondegenerate primers corresponding to regions specific for IRK channels known to be G protein activated (GIRKs; gene subfamily Kir 3.0) were synthesized and used in the PCR with reverse transcribed female rat anterior pituitary messenger RNA as the template. PCR products of predicted sizes for\nThe point mutation I331R in the GIRK1 C terminus or L337R in the GIRK4 C terminus decreased the association between the N and C termini. Mutation of a GIRK1 N-terminal hydrophobic residue, predicted structurally to interact with the C-terminal domain, also resulted in a decrease in channel function and termini association. We hypothesize that the hydrophobic nature of this GIRK1 subunit region is critical for interaction between adjacent termini and is permissive for channel gating. In addition, the homologous mutation in cytoplasmic domains of Kir2.1 (L330R) did not disrupt association, suggesting that the overall structural integrity of this region is critical for inward rectifier function. Inward rectifier potassium currents as a target for atrial fibrillation therapy. Subunits of inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir) are expressed in many different tissues of the human body. Inward rectifier currents expressed in the heart are constituted by pore-forming alpha-subunits of Kir2, Kir3, and Kir6\ninward rectifier potassium channels. Inward rectifier potassium (Kir) channels act as cellular diodes, allowing unrestricted flow of potassium (K(+)) into the cell while preventing currents of large magnitude in the outward direction. The rectification mechanism by which this occurs involves a coupling between K(+) and intracellular blockers-magnesium (Mg(2+)) or polyamines-that simultaneously occupy the permeation pathway. In addition to the transmembrane pore, Kirs possess a large cytoplasmic domain (CD) that provides a favorable electronegative environment for cations. Electrophysiological experiments have shown that the CD is a key regulator of both conductance and rectification. In this study, we calculate and compare averaged equilibrium probability densities of K(+) and Cl(-) in open-pore models of the CDs of a weak (Kir1.1-ROMK) and a strong (Kir2.1-IRK) rectifier through explicit-solvent molecular-dynamics simulations in ~1 M KCl. The CD of both channels concentrates K(+) ions greater than threefold inside the cytoplasmic pore while IRK shows an additional\nlarger inward K(+) currents than oocytes injected with only one GIRK channel subtype. Ligand-dependent activation of only one of the GIRK combinations (GIRK1 and GIRK4) was observed when channel subunits were coexpressed with the D(2) receptor in Xenopus oocytes. Dose-response data fit to a Michaelis-Menten equation gave an apparent K(d) similar to that for DA binding in anterior pituitary tissue. GIRK1 and GIRK4 proteins were coimmunoprecipitated from anterior pituitary lysates, confirming the presence of native GIRK1/GIRK4 oligomers in this tissue. These data indicate that GIRK1 and GIRK4 are excellent candidate subunits for the D(2)-activated, G protein-gated channel in pituitary lactotropes, where they play a critical role in excitation-secretion coupling. Mutation of critical GIRK subunit residues disrupts N- and C-termini association and channel function. The subfamily of G-protein-linked inwardly rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs) is coupled to G-protein receptors throughout the CNS and in the heart. We used mutational analysis to address\nglial cells. uKATP-1 and BIR form with sulfonylurea receptors, the so-called ATP-sensitive K+ channels. Thus, it is a feature of the Kir channel family that each subfamily plays a specific physiological functional role. The (Na+)-activated Kir channels identified electrophysiologically in neurons and cardiac myocytes have not yet been cloned. In this review, we overviewed the current understandings of the features of the molecular structures and functions of the four main subfamilies of Kir channels. Heteromerization of Kir2.x potassium channels contributes to the phenotype of Andersen's syndrome. Andersen's syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder related to mutations of the potassium channel Kir2.1, is characterized by cardiac arrhythmias, periodic paralysis, and dysmorphic bone structure. The aim of our study was to find out whether heteromerization of Kir2.1 channels with wild-type Kir2.2 and Kir2.3 channels contributes to the phenotype of Andersen's syndrome. The following results show that Kir2.x channels can form functional heteromers: (i)\nchannels contributes to the phenotype of Andersen's syndrome. The following results show that Kir2.x channels can form functional heteromers: (i) HEK293 cells transfected with Kir2.x-Kir2.y concatemers expressed inwardly rectifying K(+) channels with a conductance of 28-30 pS. (ii) Expression of Kir2.x-Kir2.y concatemers in Xenopus oocytes produced inwardly rectifying, Ba(2+) sensitive currents. (iii) When Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 channels were coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes the IC(50) for Ba(2+) block of the inward rectifier current differed substantially from the value expected for independent expression of homomeric channels. (iv) Coexpression of nonfunctional Kir2.x constructs, in which the GYG region of the pore region was replaced by AAA, with wild-type Kir2.x channels produced both homomeric and heteromeric dominant-negative effects. (v) Kir2.1 and Kir2.3 channels could be coimmunoprecipitated in membrane extracts from isolated guinea pig cardiomyocytes. (vi) Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed interaction between the N- and C-terminal intracellular domains of different Kir2.x subunits. Coexpression of Kir2.1\na new family of K+ channels whose subunits contain two putative transmembrane domains and a pore-forming region. So far, more than ten cDNAs of Kir channel subunits have been isolated and classified into four subfamilies: 1) IRK subfamily (IRK1-3/Kir1.1-1.3), 2) GIRK subfamily (GIRK1-4/Kir3.1-3.4), 3) ATP-dependent Kir subfamily (ROMK1/Kir1.1, K(AB)-2/Kir4.1), and 4) ATP-sensitive Kir subfamily (uKATP-1/Kir6.1, BIR/Kir6.2). Xenopus oocytes injected with the cRNAs of IRKs elicit classical Kir channel currents. GIRKs, as heteromultimers, compose the G protein-gated Kir (KG) channels, which are regulated by a variety of Gi/Go-coupled inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors such as m2-mus-carinic, serotonergic (5HT1A), GABAB, somatostatin and opioid (mu, delta, kappa) receptors. ROMK1 and KAB-2 are characterized with a Walker type-A ATP-binding motif in their carboxyl termini, and may be involved in K+ transport in renal epithelial and brain glial cells. uKATP-1 and BIR form with sulfonylurea receptors, the so-called ATP-sensitive K+ channels. Thus, it is a feature of\nthe PCR with reverse transcribed female rat anterior pituitary messenger RNA as the template. PCR products of predicted sizes for Kir 3.1, 3.2, and 3.4 were consistently observed by ethidium bromide staining after 16 amplification cycles. The identities of the products were confirmed by subcloning and sequencing. Expression of each of these gene products in anterior pituitary was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. Functional analysis of the GIRK proteins was performed in the heterologous expression system, Xenopus laevis oocytes. Macroscopic K(+) currents were examined in oocytes injected with different combinations of Kir 3.0 complementary RNA (cRNA) and G protein subunit (beta(1)gamma(2)) cRNA. The current-voltage relationships demonstrated strong inward rectification for each individual and pairwise combination of GIRK channel subunits. Oocytes coinjected with any pair of GIRK subunit cRNA exhibited significantly larger inward K(+) currents than oocytes injected with only one GIRK channel subtype. Ligand-dependent activation of only one of the\nchannels. Modulation of I K1 rectification properties seems theoretically interesting for manipulation of Kir2 currents as an antiarrhythmic approach. Kir3-based muscarinic currents (I KACh) are functionally upregulated during AF through increased constitutive activity (passing current in the absence of an agonist). Upregulated I KACh supports sustenance of the arrhythmia. There is considerable intraatrial diversity in the expression of underlying Kir3.1/Kir3.4 subunits, but atrial-specific localization makes inhibition of this current a potentially interesting antiarrhythmic target devoid of ventricular side effects. Experimental studies of specific inhibitors indicate efficacy in various disease models. The role of I KATP remodeling under AF conditions has not been extensively studied, but present evidence indicates current downregulation and modulation of IKATP seems less promising than that of other inward rectifiers.

Kir2.x inhibition was concentration-dependent but voltage-independent. The time course and degree of inhibition was independent of external or internal drug application. We tested the hypothesis that tamoxifen interferes with the interaction between the channel and the membrane-delimited channel activator, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)). Inhibition of Kir2.3 currents was significantly reduced by a single point mutation of I213L, which enhances Kir2.3 interaction with membrane PIP(2). Pretreatment with PIP(2) significantly decreased the inhibition induced by tamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and raloxifene on Kir2.3 channels. Pretreatment with spermine (100 microM) decreased the inhibitory effect of tamoxifen on Kir2.1, probably by strengthening the channel's interaction with PIP(2). In cat atrial and ventricular myocytes, 3 microM tamoxifen inhibited I(K1), but the effect was greater in the former than the latter. The data strongly suggest that tamoxifen, its metabolite, and the estrogen receptor\n3. mKir4.2 current was subject to modulation by several distinct mechanisms. Intracellular acidification decreased mKir4.2 current in a reversible fashion, while activation of protein kinase C decreased mKir4.2 current in a manner that was not rapidly reversible. Incubation of oocytes in elevated [K+] produced a slowly developing enhancement of current. 4. Oocytes co-injected with cRNA for mKir4.2 and Kir5.1, a protein that does not form functional homomeric channels, displayed membrane currents with properties distinct from those expressing mKir4.2 alone. Co-injected oocytes displayed larger currents than mKir4.2, with novel kinetic properties and an increased sensitivity to Ba2+ block at negative potentials, suggesting that mKir4.2 forms functional heteromultimeric channels with Kir5.1, as has been shown for Kir4.1 5. These results demonstrate for the first time that a Kir4.2 channel gene product forms functional channels in Xenopus oocytes, that these Kir channels display novel properties, and that Kir4.2 subunits may be responsible for\nchannels (GIRKs) is coupled to G-protein receptors throughout the CNS and in the heart. We used mutational analysis to address the role of a specific hydrophobic region of the GIRK1 subunit. Deletion of the GIRK1 C-terminal residues 330-384, as well as the point mutation I331R, resulted in a decrease in channel function when coexpressed with GIRK4 in oocytes and in COS-7 cells. Surface protein expression of GIRK1 I331R coexpressed with GIRK4 was comparable with wild type, indicating that subunits assemble and are correctly localized to the membrane. Subsequent mutation of homologous residues in both the GIRK4 subunit and Kir2.1 (Gbetagamma-independent inward rectifier) also resulted in a decrease in channel function. Intracellular domain associations resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of the GIRK1 N and C termini and GIRK4 N and C termini. The point mutation I331R in the GIRK1 C terminus or L337R in the GIRK4 C terminus decreased the association between\nwas greater in the former than the latter. The data strongly suggest that tamoxifen, its metabolite, and the estrogen receptor inhibitor raloxifene inhibit Kir2.x channels indirectly by interfering with the interaction between the channel and PIP(2).\nunderstanding the actual mechanism of rectification blockade will require high-resolution structural information of the blocked state, these simulations provide insight into how sequence variation in the CD can affect the multi-ion distributions that underlie the mechanisms of conduction, rectification affinity, and kinetics. Inwardly rectifying potassium channels: their molecular heterogeneity and function. A variety of cells including cardiac myocytes and neuronal cells possess inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) channels through which currents flow more readily in the inward direction than outward. These K+ channels play pivotal roles in maintenance of the resting membrane potential, in regulation of the action potential duration, in receptor-dependent inhibition of cellular excitability, and in the secretion and absorption of K+ ions across cell membrane. Recent molecular biological dissection has shown that the DNAs encoding Kir channels constitute a new family of K+ channels whose subunits contain two putative transmembrane domains and a pore-forming region. So far, more\nthe human body. Inward rectifier currents expressed in the heart are constituted by pore-forming alpha-subunits of Kir2, Kir3, and Kir6 subfamilies. Characteristic properties of inward rectifiers comprise small outward conductances that nevertheless are important to terminal repolarization of cardiac action potentials. There is considerable difference in the regional expression of cardiac Kir channels, and subunits are additionally regulated by specific disease conditions. Resulting changes facilitate occurrence and persistence of atrial fibrillation (AF). For instance, upregulation of Kir2.1 protein and resultant current I K1 is a hallmark of AF-related ionic remodeling. Increased I K1 helps to stabilize atrial rotors, and current inhibition has accordingly been suggested as an antiarrhythmic approach for AF therapy. But there are caveats to I K1 inhibition per se, and there is no specific inhibitor of Kir2 channels. Modulation of I K1 rectification properties seems theoretically interesting for manipulation of Kir2 currents as an antiarrhythmic approach. Kir3-based\nThe CD of both channels concentrates K(+) ions greater than threefold inside the cytoplasmic pore while IRK shows an additional K(+) accumulation region near the cytoplasmic entrance. Simulations carried out with Mg(2+) or spermine (SPM(4+)) show that these ions interact with pore-lining residues, shielding the surface charge and reducing K(+) in both channels. The results also show that SPM(4+) behaves differently inside these two channels. Although SPM(4+) remains inside the CD of ROMK, it diffuses around the entire volume of the pore. In contrast, this polyatomic cation finds long-lived conformational states inside the IRK pore, interacting with residues E224, D259, and E299. The strong rectifier CD is also capable of sequestering an additional SPM(4+) at the cytoplasmic entrance near a cluster of negative residues D249, D274, E275, and D276. Although understanding the actual mechanism of rectification blockade will require high-resolution structural information of the blocked state, these simulations provide insight",

Here, we have defined the localization and subunit interactions of KV8.2 channels in primate photoreceptors. We show that the KV8.2 subunit interacts with different Kv2 channels in rods and cones, giving rise to potassium currents with distinct functional properties. Our results provide a molecular basis for retinal dysfunction in patients with mutations in the KCNV2 gene encoding KV8.2. Mining Protein Evolution for Insights into Mechanisms of Voltage-Dependent Sodium Channel Auxiliary Subunits. Voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) beta (\u03b2) subunits have been called the \"overachieving\" auxiliary ion channel subunit. Indeed, these subunits regulate the trafficking of the sodium channel complex at the plasma membrane and simultaneously tune the voltage-dependent properties of the pore-forming alpha-subunit. It is now known that VGSC \u03b2-subunits are capable of similar modulation of\nintact S4-to-gate coupling is present. Further, we show that a triple mutation in the middle of the transmembrane (TM) segment of KCNE3 introduces KCNE1-like effects on the second S4 movement and the gate. In addition, we show that differences in two residues at the external end of the KCNE TM segments underlie differences in the effects of the different KCNEs on the first S4 movement and the voltage sensor-to-gate coupling. Structural and functional characterization of Kv6.2 a new gamma-subunit of voltage-gated potassium channel. We have cloned and functionally expressed Kv6.2, a new member of the Kv6 subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channel subunits. The human Kv6.2 (KCNF2) gene was mapped at 18q22-18q23. Kv6.2 mRNA is preferentially expressed in rat and human myocard. Rat and human Kv6.2 subunits appear to be unable to form functional Kv channels in a heterologous expression system, but, when coexpressed with Kv2.1 alpha subunits, heteromultimeric Kv channels\nchannels and illustrated their role during brain development and reproduction. These functions of potassium channels are discussed in this review in the context of regulatory interactions between electrically-active and regulatory subunits. Heteromeric KV2/KV8.2 Channels Mediate Delayed Rectifier Potassium Currents in Primate Photoreceptors. Silent voltage-gated potassium channel subunits (KVS) interact selectively with members of the KV2 channel family to modify their functional properties. The localization and functional roles of these silent subunits remain poorly understood. Mutations in the KVS subunit, KV8.2 (KCNV2), lead to severe visual impairment in humans, but the basis of these deficits remains unclear. Here, we examined the localization, native interactions, and functional properties of KV8.2-containing channels in mouse, macaque, and human photoreceptors of either sex. In human retina, KV8.2 colocalized with KV2.1 and KV2.2 in cone inner segments and with KV2.1 in rod inner segments. KV2.1 and KV2.2 could be coimmunoprecipitated with KV8.2 in retinal lysates indicating\nsubunit. Our findings define a novel function for the beta-subunit through its Src homology 3 domain and establish a link between voltage-gated calcium channel activity and the cell endocytic machinery. KCNE4 suppresses Kv1.3 currents by modulating trafficking, surface expression and channel gating. Voltage-dependent potassium channels (Kv) play a crucial role in the activation and proliferation of leukocytes. Kv channels are either homo- or hetero-oligomers. This composition modulates their surface expression and serves as a mechanism for regulating channel activity. Kv channel interaction with accessory subunits provides mechanisms for channels to respond to stimuli beyond changes in membrane potential. Here, we demonstrate that KCNE4 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E member 4), but not KCNE2, functions as an inhibitory Kv1.3 partner in leukocytes. Kv1.3 trafficking, targeting and activity are altered by the presence of KCNE4. KCNE4 decreases current density, slows activation, accelerates inactivation, increases cumulative inactivation, retains Kv1.3 in the ER and\nsmall GTPases. A Kv alpha subunit contains six transmembrane segments, including an intrinsic voltage sensor. In contrast, inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels have just two transmembrane segments in each of its four pore-lining alpha subunits. A variety of intracellular second messengers mediate transmitter and metabolic regulation of Kir channels. For example, Kir3 (GIRK) channels open on binding to the G protein betagamma subunits, thereby mediating slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in the brain. Our structure-based functional analysis on the cytoplasmic N-terminal tetramerization domain T1 of the voltage-gated channel, Kv1.2, uncovered a new function for this domain, modulation of voltage gating, and suggested a possible means of communication between second messenger pathways and Kv channels. A yeast screen for active Kir3.2 channels subjected to random mutagenesis has identified residues in the transmembrane segments that are crucial for controlling the opening of Kir3.2 channels. The identification of structural elements involved in potassium channel\nto form functional Kv channels in a heterologous expression system, but, when coexpressed with Kv2.1 alpha subunits, heteromultimeric Kv channels were formed mediating voltage-activated delayed-rectifier type outward currents. Their kinetics and conductance-voltage relationship were different from those mediated by homomultimeric Kv2.1 channels. Yeast two-hybrid reporter assays indicated that Kv6.2 amino-termini are able to interact specifically with the Kv2.1 amino-terminus. It is proposed that this protein protein interaction underlies Kv2.1/Kv6.2 subunit assembly and the expression of functional heteromultimeric Kv2.1/Kv6.2 channels. The most resiliant feature of the Kv2.1/Kv6.2 channels was their submicromolar sensitivity to the antiarrhythmic drug propafenone. The data suggest that delayed-rectifier type channels containing Kv6.2 subunits may contribute to cardiac action potential repolarization. The Role of S4 Charges in Voltage-dependent and Voltage-independent KCNQ1 Potassium Channel Complexes Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels extend their functional repertoire by coassembling with MinK-related peptides (MiRPs). MinK slows the activation of channels formed with KCNQ1 \u03b1\nby the NH2-terminal domains are strictly subfamily-specific. These subfamily-specific associations suggest a molecular basis for the selective formation of heteromultimeric channels in vivo. Structural determinants of the regulation of the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv2.1 by the modulatory \u03b1-subunit Kv9.3. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels containing alpha-subunits of the Kv2 subfamily mediate delayed rectifier currents in excitable cells. Channels formed by Kv2.1 alpha-subunits inactivate from open- and closed states with both forms of inactivation serving different physiological functions. Here we show that open- and closed-state inactivation of Kv2.1 can be distinguished by the sensitivity to intracellular tetraethylammonium and extracellular potassium and lead to the same inactivated conformation. The functional properties of Kv2.1 are regulated by its association with modulatory alpha-subunits (Kv5, Kv6, Kv8, and Kv9). For instance, Kv9.3 changes the state preference of Kv2.1 inactivation by accelerating closed-state inactivation and inhibiting open-state inactivation. An N-terminal regulatory domain (NRD) has been suggested to\nregulation of Kv2.1 by Kv9.3. The effect prevailed in heteromeric channels following co-expression of Kv2.1-P410T with Kv2.1. These data suggest that the alteration of the PXP motif is an important determinant of the regulatory function of modulatory alpha-subunits. Controlling potassium channel activities: Interplay between the membrane and intracellular factors. Neural signaling is based on the regulated timing and extent of channel opening; therefore, it is important to understand how ion channels open and close in response to neurotransmitters and intracellular messengers. Here, we examine this question for potassium channels, an extraordinarily diverse group of ion channels. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels control action-potential waveforms and neuronal firing patterns by opening and closing in response to membrane-potential changes. These effects can be strongly modulated by cytoplasmic factors such as kinases, phosphatases, and small GTPases. A Kv alpha subunit contains six transmembrane segments, including an intrinsic voltage sensor. In contrast, inwardly rectifying potassium\nsegments that are crucial for controlling the opening of Kir3.2 channels. The identification of structural elements involved in potassium channel gating in these systems highlights principles that may be important in the regulation of other types of channels. The Src homology 3 domain of the beta-subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels promotes endocytosis via dynamin interaction. High voltage-gated calcium channels enable calcium entry into cells in response to membrane depolarization. Association of the auxiliary beta-subunit to the alpha-interaction-domain in the pore-forming alpha1-subunit is required to form functional channels. The beta-subunit belongs to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase class of scaffolding proteins containing a Src homology 3 and a guanylate kinase domain. Although the latter is responsible for the high affinity binding to the alpha-interaction domain, the functional significance of the Src homology 3 domain remains elusive. Here, we show that injection of isolated beta-subunit Src homology 3 domain into Xenopus laevis oocytes\na conformation that favors the open state regardless of membrane potential. Because the exceptional charge paucity in the CO2H half of wild-type KCNQ1 S4 is required for formation of constitutively active MiRP2-KCNQ channels, demonstrated by the S4 charge addition (to KCNQ1) and deletion (from KCNQ4) experiments, the results also identify for the first time \u03b1 subunit\u2013specific sequence determinants that dictate the \u03b1 subunit\u2013specific functional effects of MiRPs. Thus, KCNQ1 S4 charge paucity represents a unique specialization among eukaryotic voltage-gated cation channels, permitting KCNQ1 to act either as a constitutively open pore or a voltage-dependent channel in contexts dictated by overlapping expression of specific ancillary subunits, facilitating multiple prominent and diverse roles in mammalian physiology. Supplemental Material Impact of ancillary subunits on ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels generate the outward K(+) ion currents that constitute the primary force in ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium channels comprise tetramers of pore-forming alpha subunits\nsegments and with KV2.1 in rod inner segments. KV2.1 and KV2.2 could be coimmunoprecipitated with KV8.2 in retinal lysates indicating that these subunits likely interact directly. Retinal KV2.1 was less phosphorylated than cortical KV2.1, a difference expected to alter the biophysical properties of these channels. Using voltage-clamp recordings and pharmacology, we provide functional evidence for Kv2-containing channels in primate rods and cones. We propose that the presence of KV8.2, and low levels of KV2.1 phosphorylation shift the activation range of KV2 channels to align with the operating range of rod and cone photoreceptors. Our data indicate a role for KV2/KV8.2 channels in human photoreceptor function and suggest that the visual deficits in patients with KCNV2 mutations arise from inadequate resting activation of KV channels in rod and cone inner segments.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Mutations in a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit, KV8.2, underlie a blinding inherited photoreceptor dystrophy, indicating an important role for\nof MiRP1 in regulating hERG (and therefore ventricular I(Kr)) in vivo. Some ancillary subunits may exhibit varied expression to shape spatial Kv current variation, for example, KChIP2 and the epicardial-endocardial I(to) current density gradient. Indeed, it is likely that most native ventricular Kv channels exhibit temporal and spatial heterogeneity of subunit composition, complicating both modeling of their functional impact on the ventricular action potential and design of specific current-targeted compounds. Here, we discuss current thinking and lines of experimentation aimed at resolving the complexities of the Kv channel complexes that repolarize the human ventricular myocardium. Assembly of voltage-gated potassium channels. Conserved hydrophilic motifs determine subfamily-specific interactions between the alpha-subunits. Voltage-gated potassium (K+) channels are assembled by four identical or homologous alpha-subunits to form a tetrameric complex with a central conduction pore for potassium ions. Most of the cloned genes for the alpha-subunits are classified into four subfamilies: Kv1 (Shaker), Kv2\nother excitable cells. Voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels permit influx of their respective ions once the threshold voltage for their activation is attained. This influx of positive ions depolarizes the cell further, activating voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels to allow efflux of K+ ions, repolarizing the cell, and ending the action potential. All voltage-gated cation channels contain four voltage-sensing S4 domains (membrane-spanning \u03b1 helices bearing basic residues) that confer voltage sensitivity. Upon cellular depolarization, S4 undergoes a conformational and/or positional change to the \u201con\u201d position, which is communicated to the channel gate, opening the channel. The exact nature of the movement that S4 undergoes when switching from the \u201coff\u201d to the \u201con\u201d position is a matter of intense debate, with some arguing for a comprehensive shift from the intracellular to the extracellular side of the plasma membrane, while others contend the conformational shift is far more subtle. The KCNQ subfamily of\nKv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels in developmental perspective. Kv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels consist of two types of \u03b1-subunits: (a) electrically-active Kcnb1 \u03b1-subunits and (b) silent or modulatory \u03b1-subunits plus \u03b2-subunits that, similar to silent \u03b1-subunits, also regulate electrically-active subunits. Voltage-gated potassium channels were traditionally viewed, mainly by electrophysiologists, as regulators of the electrical activity of the plasma membrane in excitable cells, a role that is performed by transmembrane protein domains of \u03b1-subunits that form the electric pore. Genetic studies revealed a role for this region of \u03b1-subunits of voltage-gated potassium channels in human neurodevelopmental disorders, such as epileptic encephalopathy. The N- and C-terminal domains of \u03b1-subunits interact to form the cytoplasmic subunit of heterotetrameric potassium channels that regulate electric pores. Subsequent animal studies revealed the developmental functions of Kcnb1-containing voltage-gated potassium channels and illustrated their role during brain development and reproduction. These functions of potassium channels are discussed in this review\nKCNQ1 S4 and S4\u2013S5 linker domains (Fig. 11) was performed with the SWISS-MODEL program using structural coordinates from X-ray crystallographic studies of similar domains in Kv1.2 as a template. Images were prepared using PROTEIN EXPLORER ALPHA. Online Supplemental Material Fig. S1 (available at http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200609612/DC1) illustrates raw and normalized current\u2013voltage relationships for wild-type, R228A, R231A, and R237A KCNQ1 channels. RESULTS KCNQ1 is a Kv channel \u03b1 subunit in the S4 superfamily of voltage-gated ion channels. Each KCNQ1 \u03b1 subunit bears six transmembrane helices with the fourth, S4, being considered the principal component of voltage sensing (Fig. 1 A). MiRPs are predicted to span the membrane once (Fig. 1 A). Here, alignment of S4 domains from all known eukaryotic voltage-gated cation channel \u03b1 subunits revealed a unique paucity of net positive charge (+3) in the KCNQ1 S4, compared with +7 in Shaker, +5 in other KCNQ channels, +6 in HCN channels, and\nextracellular side of the plasma membrane, while others contend the conformational shift is far more subtle. The KCNQ subfamily of Kv channel \u03b1 subunits contains five known members, KCNQ1\u20135. While KCNQ2\u20135 are neuronally expressed and contribute to the M-current, KCNQ1 is expressed in the heart, gastrointestinal epithelia, and inner ear, but not the brain. MiRPs (MinK-related peptides), encoded by KCNE genes, are single transmembrane domain ancillary subunits that coassemble with a wide array of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels and hyperpolarization-activated, cation-nonselective (HCN) channels to alter their gating, conductance, regulation, and pharmacology. KCNQ1 is unique among voltage-gated ion channels in that it can be converted to a voltage-independent, constitutively active, \u201cleak\u201d channel by association with ancillary subunits (MiRP1 and MiRP2). Indeed, even other KCNQ subfamily \u03b1 subunits reportedly interact with MiRPs but do not become leak channels: KCNQ2/3 with MiRP1 and KCNQ4 with MiRP2. This unique loss of voltage dependence is\npresence of KCNE4. KCNE4 decreases current density, slows activation, accelerates inactivation, increases cumulative inactivation, retains Kv1.3 in the ER and impairs channel targeting to lipid raft microdomains. KCNE4 associates with Kv1.3 in the ER and decreases the number of Kv1.3 channels at the cell surface, which diminishes cell excitability. Kv1.3 and KCNE4 are differentially regulated upon activation or immunosuppression in macrophages. Thus, lipopolysaccharide-induced activation increases Kv1.3 and KCNE4 mRNA, whereas dexamethasone triggers a decrease in Kv1.3 with no changes in KCNE4. The channelosome composition determines the activity and affects surface expression and membrane localization. Therefore, KCNE4 association might play a crucial role in controlling immunological responses. Our results indicate that KCNE ancillary subunits could be new targets for immunomodulation. Molecular studies of voltage-gated potassium channels. The cloning and characterization of the voltage-activated Shaker potassium channel gene in Drosophila have led to the identification of structural elements involved in potassium channel\n3 domain remains elusive. Here, we show that injection of isolated beta-subunit Src homology 3 domain into Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing the alpha1-subunit reduces the number of channels in the plasma membrane. This effect is reverted by coexpressing alpha1 with a dominant-negative mutant of dynamin, a GTPase involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis. Full-length beta-subunit also down-regulates voltage-gated calcium channels but only when lacking the alpha-interaction domain. Moreover, isolated Src homology 3 domain and the full-length beta-subunit were found to interact in vitro with dynamin and to internalize the distantly related Shaker potassium channel. These results demonstrate that the beta-subunit regulates the turnover of voltage-gated calcium channels and other proteins in the cell membrane. This effect is mediated by dynamin and depends on the association state of the beta-subunit to the alpha1-pore-forming subunit. Our findings define a novel function for the beta-subunit through its Src homology 3 domain and establish a link\nextend their functional repertoire by coassembling with MinK-related peptides (MiRPs). MinK slows the activation of channels formed with KCNQ1 \u03b1 subunits to generate the voltage-dependent IKs channel in human heart; MiRP1 and MiRP2 remove the voltage dependence of KCNQ1 to generate potassium \u201cleak\u201d currents in gastrointestinal epithelia. Other Kv \u03b1 subunits interact with MiRP1 and MiRP2 but without loss of voltage dependence; the mechanism for this disparity is unknown. Here, sequence alignments revealed that the voltage-sensing S4 domain of KCNQ1 bears lower net charge (+3) than that of any other eukaryotic voltage-gated ion channel. We therefore examined the role of KCNQ1 S4 charges in channel activation using alanine-scanning mutagenesis and two-electrode voltage clamp. Alanine replacement of R231, at the N-terminal side of S4, produced constitutive activation in homomeric KCNQ1 channels, a phenomenon not observed with previous single amino acid substitutions in S4 of other channels. Homomeric KCNQ4 channels were also\nthe voltage-activated Shaker potassium channel gene in Drosophila have led to the identification of structural elements involved in potassium channel gating. As found for the voltage-activated sodium channel, the S4 segment, located in the conserved core of the protein, plays a central role in voltage-dependent activation. Potassium channels appear to be formed by the assembly of several polypeptides into multisubunit channels. This is directly analogous to the proposed folding of the four internally homologous pseudosubunits of sodium and calcium channels. The amino- and carboxy-terminal regions of Shaker channels are specialized for, and appear to interact in, inactivation gating. This interaction probably includes interaction between subunits, as may be said for the role in inactivation gating of the junction between the carboxyl terminus of the third domain and amino terminus of the fourth domain of sodium channel (Vassilev et al. 1988). The capacity for coassembly in potassium channels extends not only",

Functional characterization of Kv channel beta-subunits from rat brain. 1. The potassium channel beta-subunit from rat brain, Kv beta 1.1, is known to induce inactivation of the delayed rectifier channel Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 delta 1-110. 2. Kv beta 1.1 was co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes with various other potassium channel alpha-subunits. Kv beta 1.1 induced inactivation in members of the Kv1 subfamily with the exception of Kv 1.6; no inactivation of Kv 2.1, Kv 3.4 delta 2-28 and Kv4.1 channels could be observed. 3. The second member of the beta-subunit subfamily, Kv beta 2, had a shorter N-terminal end, accelerated inactivation of the A-type channel Kv 1.4, but did not induce inactivation when co-expressed with delayed rectifiers of the Kv1\nA double-point mutation in the selectivity filter site of the KCNQ1 potassium channel results in a severe phenotype, LQT1, of long QT syndrome. INTRODUCTION: Slowly activating delayed-rectifier potassium currents in the heart are produced by a complex protein with alpha and beta subunits composed of the potassium voltage-gated channel KQT-like subfamily, member 1 (KCNQ1) and the potassium voltage-gated channel Isk-related family, member 1 (KCNE1), respectively. Mutations in KCNQ1 underlie the most common type of hereditary long QT syndrome (LQTS). Like other potassium channels, KCNQ1 has six transmembrane domains and a highly conserved potassium selectivity filter in the pore helix called \"the signature sequence.\" We aimed to investigate the functional consequences of a newly identified mutation within the signature sequence.METHODS AND RESULTS: Potassium channel genomic DNA from a family with clinical evidence of LQTS was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the resulting products were then sequenced. Three family members\nthe voltage-gated potassium channel subfamily Q member 1 (KCNQ1) can induce cardiac arrhythmia. In this study, it was tested whether any of the known human GOF disease mutations in KCNQ1 act by increasing the amount of KCNQ1 that reaches the cell surface-\"supertrafficking.\" Seven of the 15 GOF mutants tested were seen to surface traffic more efficiently than the WT channel. Among these, we found that the levels of R231C KCNQ1 in the plasma membrane were fivefold higher than the WT channel. This was shown to arise from the combined effects of enhanced efficiency of translocon-mediated membrane integration of the S4 voltage-sensor helix and from enhanced post-translational folding/trafficking related to the energetic linkage of C231 with the V129 and F166 side chains. Whole-cell electrophysiology recordings confirmed that R231C KCNQ1 in complex with the voltage-gated potassium channel-regulatory subfamily E member 1 not only exhibited constitutive conductance but also revealed that the single-channel\nof functional heterodimers. Taking advantage of a tandem construct (in which the two different subunits were linked together to enforce heterodimerization), we characterized the biophysical and pharmacological properties of the TREK-1/TREK-2 current. The heteromer was inhibited by extracellular acidification and by spadin similarly to TREK-1, and its ruthenium red sensitivity was intermediate between TREK-1 and TREK-2 homodimers. The heterodimer has also been distinguished from the homodimers by its unique single channel conductance. Assembly of the two different subunits was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged TREK-1 and TREK-2 subunits, coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes. Formation of TREK-1/TREK-2 channels was also demonstrated in native dorsal root ganglion neurons indicating that heterodimerization may provide greater diversity of leak K(+) conductances also in native tissues. Disease-linked supertrafficking of a potassium channel. Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in the voltage-gated potassium channel subfamily Q member 1 (KCNQ1) can induce cardiac arrhythmia. In this study, it was tested whether\nvenoms contain 30-40 amino acids with three or four disulfide bridges. These peptides belong to \u03b1-KTx subfamily. On the other hand, the \u03b2-KTx subfamily is poorly characterized, though it is very representative in some scorpion venoms. A transcriptomic approach of T.stigmurus scorpions developed by our group revealed the repertoire of possible molecules present in the venom, including many toxins of the \u03b2-KTx subfamily. One of the ESTs found, named TSTI0003C has a cDNA sequence of 538 bp codifying a mature protein with 47 amino acid residues, corresponding to 5299 Da. This \u03b2-KTx peptide is a new member of the BmTXK\u03b2-related toxins, and was here named TstKMK. The three-dimensional structure of this potassium channel toxin of the T. stigmurus scorpion was obtained by computational modeling and refined by molecular dynamic simulations. Furthermore, we have made docking simulations using a Shaker kV-1.2 potassium channel from rats as receptor model and proposed which\ndiversifying functionality through an expansion of the channel types within the K2P channels. Mechanism of functional interaction between potassium channel Kv1.3 and sodium channel NavBeta1 subunit. The voltage-gated potassium channel subfamily A member 3 (Kv1.3) dominantly expresses on T cells and neurons. Recently, the interaction between Kv1.3 and NavBeta1 subunits has been explored through ionic current measurements, but the molecular mechanism has not been elucidated yet. We explored the functional interaction between Kv1.3 and NavBeta1 through gating current measurements using the Cut-open Oocyte Voltage Clamp (COVC) technique. We showed that the N-terminal 1-52 sequence of hKv1.3 disrupts the channel expression on the Xenopus oocyte membrane, suggesting a potential role as regulator of hKv1.3 expression in neurons and lymphocytes. Our gating currents measurements showed that NavBeta1 interacts with the voltage sensing domain (VSD) of Kv1.3 through W172 in the transmembrane segment and modifies the gating operation. The comparison between G-V and\nmembers of the same or different subfamilies is case specific. Human \u03b1-defensins are immune-related Kv1.3 channel inhibitors: new support for their roles in adaptive immunity. Defensins form a major family of antimicrobial peptides. Recently, human \u03b2-defensin 2 and fungal plectasin were shown to be immune-related potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 3 (Kv1.3) channel inhibitors. This work continued to show that the human \u03b1-defensins human neutrophil peptide (HNP) 1 and human defensin (HD) 5 are selective Kv1.3 channel inhibitors with 50% inhibition concentration values of 102.0 \u00b1 30.3 nM and 2.2 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM, respectively. Furthermore, HNP1 was found to inhibit Kv1.3 currents and IL-2 secretion in human CD3(+) T cells. Despite the structural similarity between HNP1 and HD5, HNP1 could simultaneously bind to the S1-S2 linker and the pore region of the Kv1.3 channel as both a toxinlike blocker and a novel modifier, whereas HD5 could only bind to\nwith the voltage-gated potassium channel-regulatory subfamily E member 1 not only exhibited constitutive conductance but also revealed that the single-channel activity of this mutant is only 20% that of WT. The GOF phenotype associated with R231C therefore reflects the effects of supertrafficking and constitutive channel activation, which together offset reduced channel activity. These investigations show that membrane protein supertrafficking can contribute to human disease. Impact of ancillary subunits on ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels generate the outward K(+) ion currents that constitute the primary force in ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium channels comprise tetramers of pore-forming alpha subunits and, in probably most cases in vivo, ancillary or beta subunits that help define the properties of the Kv current generated. Ancillary subunits can be broadly categorized as cytoplasmic or transmembrane and can modify Kv channel trafficking, conductance, gating, ion selectivity, regulation, and pharmacology. Because of their often profound effects on Kv\n6. Kv beta 2 accelerated the activation time course of Kv1.5 but had no marked effect on channel deactivation. Formation of Functional Heterodimers by TREK-1 and TREK-2 Two-pore Domain Potassium Channel Subunits. Two-pore domain (K2P) potassium channels are the major molecular correlates of the background (leak) K(+) current in a wide variety of cell types. They generally play a key role in setting the resting membrane potential and regulate the response of excitable cells to various stimuli. K2P channels usually function as homodimers, and only a few examples of heteromerization have been previously reported. Expression of the TREK (TWIK-related K(+) channel) subfamily members of K2P channels often overlaps in neurons and in other excitable cells. Here, we demonstrate that heterologous coexpression of TREK-1 and TREK-2 subunits results in the formation of functional heterodimers. Taking advantage of a tandem construct (in which the two different subunits were linked together to enforce\nof channel function, leading to a long QT interval and subsequent syncope. Heterodimerization within the TREK channel subfamily produces a diverse family of highly regulated potassium channels. Twik-related K(+) channel 1 (TREK1), TREK2, and Twik-related arachidonic-acid stimulated K(+) channel (TRAAK) form the TREK subfamily of two-pore-domain K(+) (K2P) channels. Despite sharing up to 78% sequence homology and overlapping expression profiles in the nervous system, these channels show major differences in their regulation by physiological stimuli. For instance, TREK1 is inhibited by external acidification, whereas TREK2 is activated. Here, we investigated the ability of the members of the TREK subfamily to assemble to form functional heteromeric channels with novel properties. Using single-molecule pull-down (SiMPull) from HEK cell lysate and subunit counting in the plasma membrane of living cells, we show that TREK1, TREK2, and TRAAK readily coassemble. TREK1 and TREK2 can each heterodimerize with TRAAK, but do so less efficiently than\nfocus for future diagnostic approaches and research for this devastating condition. Regions responsible for the assembly of inwardly rectifying potassium channels. Inwardly rectifying potassium channels have an important role in determining the resting potential of the cell. They are tetrameric proteins with two transmembrane segments (M1 and M2), a pore-forming loop (H5), a cytoplasmic N-terminal, and longer C-terminal domain. We have used biochemical and electrophysiological methods to identify regions required for homotypic interactions and those responsible for the incompatibility between IRK1 and two other members of the same subfamily (IRK2 and IRK3) and two members from other subfamilies (ROMK1 and 6.1 uK(ATP)). The data indicate that, in contrast to the voltage-gated class of potassium channel, the proximal C-terminus and the transmembrane segment M2 determine homo-and heteromultimerization and that heteromultimerization between members of the same or different subfamilies is case specific. Human \u03b1-defensins are immune-related Kv1.3 channel inhibitors: new support for\ninactivation of the A-type channel Kv 1.4, but did not induce inactivation when co-expressed with delayed rectifiers of the Kv1 channel family. 4. To test whether this subunit co-assembles with Kv alpha-subunits, the N-terminal inactivating domains of Kv beta 1.1 and Kv beta 3 were spliced to the N-terminus of Kv beta 2. The chimaeric beta-subunits (beta 1/ beta 2 and beta 3/ beta 2) induced fast inactivation of several Kv1 channels, indicating that Kv beta 2 associates with these alpha-subunits. No inactivation was induced in Kv 1.3, Kv 1.6, Kv2.1 and Kv3.4 delta 2-28 channels. 5. Kv beta 2 caused a voltage shift in the activation threshold of Kv1.5 of about -10 mV, indicating a putative physiological role. Kv beta 2 had a smaller effect on Kv 1.1 channels. 6. Kv beta 2 accelerated the activation time course of Kv1.5 but had no marked effect on channel deactivation. Formation\nevidence of LQTS was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the resulting products were then sequenced. Three family members had a double-point mutation in KCNQ1 at nucleotides 938 (T-to-A) and 939 (C-to-A), resulting in an isoleucine-to-lysine change at amino acid position 313. These patients displayed prolonged QTc intervals (629, 508, and 500 ms(1/2,) respectively) and repetitive episodes of syncope, but no deafness. Three-dimensional structure modeling of KCNQ1 revealed that this mutation is located at the center of the channel pore. COS-7 cells displayed a lack of current when transfected with a plasmid expressing the mutant. In addition, the mutant displayed a dominant negative effect on current but appeared normal with respect to plasma membrane integration.CONCLUSION: An I313K mutation within the selectivity filter of KCNQ1 results in a dominant-negative loss of channel function, leading to a long QT interval and subsequent syncope. Heterodimerization within the TREK channel subfamily produces a\ndomain (VSD) of Kv1.3 through W172 in the transmembrane segment and modifies the gating operation. The comparison between G-V and Q-V with/without NavBeta1 indicates that NavBeta1 may strengthen the coupling between hKv1.3-VSD movement and pore opening, inducing the modification of kinetics in ionic activation and deactivation. Molecular approaches for structural characterization of a new potassium channel blocker from Tityus stigmurus venom: cDNA cloning, homology modeling, dynamic simulations and docking. Potassium channels are involved in the maintenance of resting membrane potential, control of cardiac and neuronal excitability, neurotransmitters release, muscle contractility and hormone secretion. The Tityus stigmurus scorpion is widely distributed in Northeastern Brazil and known to cause severe human envenomations, inducing pain, hypoesthesia, edema, erythema, paresthesia, headaches and vomiting. Most potassium channel blocking peptides that have been purified from scorpion venoms contain 30-40 amino acids with three or four disulfide bridges. These peptides belong to \u03b1-KTx subfamily. On the other\nnocturnal frontal lobe seizures. Three patients had a trial of quinidine with good clinical response in 1 patient. Computational modeling analysis implicates abnormal pore function (F346L) and impaired tetramer formation (F502V) as putative disease mechanisms. All evaluated KCNT1 variants resulted in marked gain of function with significantly increased channel amplitude and variable blockade by quinidine.CONCLUSIONS: Gain-of-function KCNT1 pathogenic variants cause a spectrum of severe focal epilepsies with onset in early infancy. Currently, genotype-phenotype correlations are unclear, although clinical outcome is poor for the majority of cases. Further elucidation of disease mechanisms may facilitate the development of targeted treatments, much needed for this pharmacoresistant genetic epilepsy.\nTREK1, TREK2, and TRAAK readily coassemble. TREK1 and TREK2 can each heterodimerize with TRAAK, but do so less efficiently than with each other. We functionally characterized the heterodimers and found that all combinations form outwardly rectifying potassium-selective channels but with variable voltage sensitivity and pH regulation. TREK1-TREK2 heterodimers show low levels of activity at physiological external pH but, unlike their corresponding homodimers, are activated by both acidic and alkaline conditions. Modeling based on recent crystal structures, along with mutational analysis, suggests that each subunit within a TREK1-TREK2 channel is regulated independently via titratable His. Finally, TREK1/TRAAK heterodimers differ in function from TRAAK homodimers in two critical ways: they are activated by both intracellular acidification and alkalinization and are regulated by the enzyme phospholipase D2. Thus, heterodimerization provides a means for diversifying functionality through an expansion of the channel types within the K2P channels. Mechanism of functional interaction between potassium channel\nseizures of infancy. Malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy (MMPSI) is a rare epileptic encephalopathy of infancy that combines pharmacoresistant seizures with developmental delay. We performed exome sequencing in three probands with MMPSI and identified de novo gain-of-function mutations affecting the C-terminal domain of the KCNT1 potassium channel. We sequenced KCNT1 in 9 additional individuals with MMPSI and identified mutations in 4 of them, in total identifying mutations in 6 out of 12 unrelated affected individuals. Functional studies showed that the mutations led to constitutive activation of the channel, mimicking the effects of phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain by protein kinase C. In addition to regulating ion flux, KCNT1 has a non-conducting function, as its C terminus interacts with cytoplasmic proteins involved in developmental signaling pathways. These results provide a focus for future diagnostic approaches and research for this devastating condition. Regions responsible for the assembly of inwardly rectifying potassium\ncan modify Kv channel trafficking, conductance, gating, ion selectivity, regulation, and pharmacology. Because of their often profound effects on Kv channel function, studies of the molecular correlates of ventricular repolarization must take into account ancillary subunits as well as alpha subunits. Cytoplasmic ancillary subunits include the Kv beta subunits, which regulate a range of Kv channels and may link channel gating to redox potential, and the KChIPs, which appear most often associated with Kv4 subfamily channels that generate the ventricular I(to) current. Transmembrane ancillary subunits include the MinK-related proteins (MiRPs) encoded by KCNE genes, which modulate members of most Kv alpha subunit subfamilies, and the putative 12-transmembrane domain KCR1 protein, which modulates hERG. In some cases, such as the ventricular I(Ks) channel complex, it is well established that the KCNQ1 alpha subunit must coassemble with the MinK (KCNE1) single-transmembrane domain ancillary subunit for recapitulation of the characteristic, unusually slowly-activating I(Ks)\nalpha subunit must coassemble with the MinK (KCNE1) single-transmembrane domain ancillary subunit for recapitulation of the characteristic, unusually slowly-activating I(Ks) current. In other cases, it is not so clear-cut, and in particular, the roles of the other MiRPs (1-4) in regulating cardiac Kv channels such as KCNQ1 and hERG in vivo are under debate. MiRP1 alters hERG function and pharmacology, and inherited MiRP1 mutations are associated with inherited and acquired arrhythmias, but controversy exists over the native role of MiRP1 in regulating hERG (and therefore ventricular I(Kr)) in vivo. Some ancillary subunits may exhibit varied expression to shape spatial Kv current variation, for example, KChIP2 and the epicardial-endocardial I(to) current density gradient. Indeed, it is likely that most native ventricular Kv channels exhibit temporal and spatial heterogeneity of subunit composition, complicating both modeling of their functional impact on the ventricular action potential and design of specific current-targeted compounds. Here, we\nof pathogenic variants in early-onset KCNT1 epilepsy.METHODS: We identified a cohort of 31 patients with epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS) and screened for variants in KCNT1 using direct Sanger sequencing, a multiple-gene next-generation sequencing panel, and whole-exome sequencing. Additional patients with non-EIMFS early-onset epilepsy in whom we identified KCNT1 variants on local diagnostic multiple gene panel testing were also included. When possible, we performed homology modeling to predict the putative effects of variants on protein structure and function. We undertook electrophysiologic assessment of mutant KCNT1 channels in a xenopus oocyte model system.RESULTS: We identified pathogenic variants in KCNT1 in 12 patients, 4 of which are novel. Most variants occurred de novo. Ten patients had a clinical diagnosis of EIMFS, and the other 2 presented with early-onset severe nocturnal frontal lobe seizures. Three patients had a trial of quinidine with good clinical response in 1 patient. Computational modeling",

NMR relaxation experiments point to a reduced conformational plasticity of cerato-populin loops with respect to the ones of cerato-platanin. The different electrostatic surface of the loops combined with a distinct network of intra-molecular interactions are expected to be factors that, by leading to a diverse spatial organization and dissimilar\nto elucidate the application potential of CPPs further and to reveal which properties are specific for individual CPPs and which properties can be generally found in all members of the CPP family.

The so far known biochemical properties of cerato-platanin proteins are summarized in this review, and potential biotechnological applications as well as implications of these properties for the biological functions of cerato-platanin proteins are discussed. Introduction Proteins belonging to the cerato-platanin protein (CPP) family are only found in filamentous fungi, i.e. fungi that produce hyphae as growth structures, or in fungi which have at least a pseudo-hyphal growth stage during their life cycle. The name-giving protein for this family was cerato-platanin (CP) from the plant pathogenic fungus Ceratocystis platani, which infects plane trees. CP was first described in 1999 (Pazzagli et al.).\nactivity in an expansin-like manner. Though the disruption of the FgCPP genes had no demonstrable impact on fungal virulence, our experimental data suggest their probable involvement in virulence, thus we refer to them as accessory virulence genes. Our results suggest also that the FgCPPs could be exploited for future biotechnological application in second-generation biofuels production on lignocellulosic biomasses rich in cellulose. Finally, we demonstrate that FgCPPs act as elicitors of defense responses on Arabidopsis leaves, increasing resistance to Botrytis cinerea infections. A mechanistic model may explain the dissimilar biological efficiency of the fungal elicitors cerato-platanin and cerato-populin. Among their various functions, the members of the cerato-platanin family can stimulate plants' defense responses and induce resistance against microbial pathogens. Recent results suggest that conserved loops, also involved in chitin binding, might be a structural motif central for their eliciting activity. Here, we focus on cerato-platanin and its orthologous cerato-populin, searching for\nplant pathogens (namely Botrytis cinerea, Alternaria brassicicola and Golovinomyces orontii). Our results suggest that SsCP1 is important for virulence of S. sclerotiorum and that it can be recognized by plants to trigger plant defense responses. Our results also suggest that the SA signaling pathway is involved in CP-mediated plant defense . Cerato-populin and cerato-platanin, two non-catalytic proteins from phytopathogenic fungi, interact with hydrophobic inanimate surfaces and leaves. Based on sequence homology, several fungal Cys-rich secreted proteins have been grouped in the cerato-platanin (CP) family, which comprises at least 40 proteins involved mainly in eliciting defense-related responses. The core member of this family is cerato-platanin, a moderately hydrophobic protein with a double \u03c8-\u03b2 barrel fold. CP and the recently identified orthologous cerato-populin (Pop1) are involved in host-fungus interaction, and can be considered non-catalytic fungal PAMPs. CP is more active in inducing defense when in an aggregated conformation than in its native\nresistance (SAR) in tobacco and generates a wave of salicylic acid expanding from the site of application The phytotoxic activity of the cerato-platanin BcSpl1 resides in a two-peptide motif in the protein surface Self-assembly at air/water interfaces and carbohydrate-binding properties of the small secreted protein EPL1 from the fungus Trichoderma atroviride Gaderer R (2013) Functional characterization of a fungal gene family encoding plant defense response-eliciting proteins in Trichoderma biocontrol species.

These proteins appear to be readily recognized by other organisms and are therefore important factors in interactions of fungi with other organisms, e.g. by stimulating the induction of defence responses in plants. However, it is not known yet whether the main function of cerato-platanin proteins is associated with these fungal interactions or rather a role in fungal growth and development. Cerato-platanin proteins seem to unify several biochemical properties that are not found in this combination in other proteins. On one hand, cerato-platanins are carbohydrate-binding proteins and are able to bind to chitin and N-acetylglucosamine oligosaccharides; on the other hand, they are able to self-assemble at hydrophobic/hydrophilic interfaces and form protein layers, e.g. on the surface of aqueous solutions, thereby altering the polarity of solutions and surfaces. The latter\ndistinct network of intra-molecular interactions are expected to be factors that, by leading to a diverse spatial organization and dissimilar collective motions, can regulate the eliciting efficacy of the two proteins and their affinity for oligosaccharides. Self-assembly at air/water interfaces and carbohydrate binding properties of the small secreted protein EPL1 from the fungus Trichoderma atroviride. The protein EPL1 from the fungus Trichoderma atroviride belongs to the cerato-platanin protein family. These proteins occur only in filamentous fungi and are associated with the induction of defense responses in plants and allergic reactions in humans. However, fungi with other lifestyles also express cerato-platanin proteins, and the primary function of this protein family has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we investigated the biochemical properties of the cerato-platanin protein EPL1 from T. atroviride. Our results showed that EPL1 readily self-assembles at air/water interfaces and forms protein layers that can be redissolved in water.\nCerato-platanin shows expansin-like activity on cellulosic materials. Cerato-platanin (CP) is a non-catalytic protein with a double \u03c8\u03b2-barrel fold located in the cell wall of the phytopathogenic fungus Ceratocystis platani. CP is released during growth and induces defence-related responses in plants. CP is also the first member of the \"cerato-platanin family\" (CPF) (Pfam PF07249). In the CPF, the molecular mechanism of action on plants and above all the biological role in fungal life are little-known aspects. However, an expansin-like function has recently been suggested concerning CP. Expansin-like proteins have the ability to act non-hydrolytically on cellulose. In the present work, the expansin-like activity of CP and Pop1, a CP family member, was investigated. Like expansins, CP and Pop1 were able to weaken filter paper in a concentration-dependent manner and without the production of reducing sugars. A metal-dependent polysaccharide monooxygenase-like activity was excluded. The optimum of activity was pH5.0, 38 \u00b0C. CP\nand showed that they present distinct expression profiles throughout fungal development and infection. We determined the X-ray crystal structures of MpCP1, MpCP2, MpCP3, and MpCP5, representative of different branches of a phylogenetic tree and expressed at different stages of the disease. Structure-based biochemistry, in combination with nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry, allowed us to define specialized capabilities regarding self-assembling and the direct binding to chitin and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) tetramers, a fungal cell wall building block, and to map a previously unknown binding region in MpCP5. Moreover, fibers of MpCP2 were shown to act as expansin and facilitate basidiospore germination whereas soluble MpCP5 blocked NAG6-induced defense response. The correlation between these roles, the fungus life cycle, and its tug-of-war interaction with cacao plants is discussed. A cerato-platanin protein SsCP1 targets plant PR1 and contributes to virulence of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Cerato-platanin proteins (CPs), which are secreted by filamentous fungi, are phytotoxic\nsecreted by fungi, which fulfil diverse functions to support the infection process. Most of these proteins are highly specialized, with structural and biochemical information often absent. Here, we present the atomic structures of the cerato-platanin-like protein Cpl1 from Ustilago maydis and its homologue Uvi2 from Ustilago hordei. Both proteins adopt a double-\u03a8\u03b2-barrel architecture reminiscent of cerato-platanin proteins, a class so far not described in smut fungi. Our structure-function analysis shows that Cpl1 binds to soluble chitin fragments via two extended grooves at the dimer interface of the two monomer molecules. This carbohydrate-binding mode has not been observed previously and expands the repertoire of chitin-binding proteins. Cpl1 localizes to the cell wall of U. maydis and might synergize with cell wall-degrading and decorating proteins during maize infection. The architecture of Cpl1 harbouring four surface-exposed loop regions supports the idea that it might play a role in the spatial coordination of these\nconsidered non-catalytic fungal PAMPs. CP is more active in inducing defense when in an aggregated conformation than in its native form, but little is known about other CP-orthologous proteins. Here, we cloned, expressed, and purified recombinant Pop1, which was used to characterize the protein aggregates. Our results suggest that the unfolded, self-assembled Pop1 is more active in inducing defense, and that the unfolding process can be induced by interaction with hydrophobic inanimate surfaces such as Teflon, treated mica, and gold sheets. In vivo, we found that both CP and Pop1 interact with the hydrophobic cuticle of leaves. Therefore, we propose that the interaction of these proteins with host cuticle waxes could induce unfolding and consequently trigger their PAMP-like activity. Cerato-platanins: a fungal protein family with intriguing properties and application potential Cerato-platanin proteins are small, secreted proteins with four conserved cysteines that are abundantly produced by filamentous fungi with all types\nexclusively interact with the CP-S domain because the binding site of TW-tail on CP relatively shifts to the CP-S domain compared with that of CP/CARMIL. This result supports our hypothesis that the dissociation of CP from the barbed end is regulated by the flexibility of CP. The Fusarium graminearum cerato-platanins loosen cellulose substrates enhancing fungal cellulase activity as expansin-like proteins. Cerato-platanin proteins (CPPs) are small non-catalytic, cysteine-rich hydrophobic proteins produced by filamentous fungi. The genome of Fusarium graminearum, the causal agent of Fusarium head blight disease of wheat and other cereal grains, contains two genes putatively encoding for CPPs. To better characterize their features, the two FgCPPs were heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant FgCPPs reduced the viscosity of a cellulose soluble derivate (carboxymethyl cellulose, CMC). The same effect was not observed on other polysaccharide substrates such as chitin, 1,3-\u03b2-glucan, xylan and pectin. Indeed, differently from other fungal CPPs\nthe interaction of fungi with other organisms, or do they have a primary role in fungal growth? Or do they even have multiple roles? In order to answer these questions, a more detailed understanding of the biochemical properties of CPPs is necessary. The studies so far conducted on this topic revealed intriguing properties for this protein family ranging from carbohydrate-binding and carbohydrate-disrupting abilities to protein self-assembly and biofilm formation. Therefore, in this review, the so far known biochemical properties of CPPs, as well as similarities and differences to protein families with related properties, are discussed. Further, we examine what these properties can potentially tell us about the biological functions of CPPs and how these findings could be important for biotechnological applications. Features of cerato-platanin proteins: carbohydrate binding and modification CPPs are small proteins of ca. 12 kDa and contain a signal peptide that targets them to the secretory pathway. They\nafter prolonged incubation times and harsher incubation conditions (Pazzagli et al.; Sbrana et al.; de O Barsottini et al.). Rapid formation (less than 30 min) of Pop1 aggregates was observed upon contact with hydrophobic surfaces (Teflon beads), and it was shown that in vivo Pop1 is able to interact with the hydrophobic cuticle of leaves (Martellini et al.). The authors therefore proposed that the interaction of CPPs with host plant cuticle waxes could induce their partial unfolding and thereby enhance the recognition of the proteins by the plant. Differences and similarities between cerato-platanin proteins and hydrophobins The ability to self-assemble at interfaces and to alter the polarity of solutions and surfaces is reminiscent of another protein family: hydrophobins. They are a family of small, secreted cysteine-rich proteins that, similar to CPPs, also solely occur in filamentous fungi (Linder et al.; W\u00f6sten and Wessels). These proteins self-assemble in the form of\nthese two protein families are complementary. EPL1 increases the polarity of surfaces and solutions, which is the opposite of what has been described for hydrophobins, and thus, CPPs could possibly rather be described as \u2018hydrophilins\u2019 in this respect. It will be interesting and necessary to determine these parameters for other proteins of the CPP family. Gene numbers and gene expression of cerato-platanin proteins Genome analysis showed that all filamentous fungi belonging to the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota have CP-encoding genes, but their numbers vary strongly among different phyla (Chen et al.). Basidiomycota have often many CP genes, e.g. the nectrotrophic plant pathogen M. perniciosa, the causal agent of witches\u2019 broom disease in cacao, has 12 CP genes (de O Barsottini et al.). In contrast to that, fungi belonging to Ascomycota have only between one and three CP-encoding genes (Frischmann et al.; Chen et al.). Further, Ascomycota have usually one strongly\nof such a hypothesis, particularly since some of these effects might be more significant in the natural environment than under laboratory conditions, but in support of the general idea that CPPs influence the interaction of fungal hyphae with their environment, we recently obtained experimental data that showed that EPL1 is able to alter the surface properties of hydrophobin layers (Bonazza et al.). (Potential) biological roles of cerato-platanin proteins in interactions between fungi and other organisms In fungal-plant interactions, CPPs have been shown to act as virulence factors and elicitors of plant defence responses. For several plant pathogenic fungi, it was reported that CPPs are an important factor for virulence or induce necrosis in plant tissue (Fr\u00edas et al.; Scala et al.; Jeong et al.). The eliciting activity of BcSpl1 from B. cinerea was mapped to a two-peptide motif on the protein surface (Fr\u00edas et al.). A review discussing the plant-related\nfollow-up paper. CPPs from other fungi were not tested for protease activity, and it might be something that should be kept in mind although the reported protease activity could have resulted from an impurity of the protein preparation. In general, it can be concluded with respect to the roles of CPPs in the interactions between fungi and other organisms that CPPs are readily recognized, e.g. by plants or humans, probably due to their abundant secretion by fungi. We suggest that the presence of CPPs signals the other organism reliably the presence of a fungus, but probably dependent on other factors of this interaction, this can lead to different responses with positive or negative consequences for this interaction. Possibilities for biotechnological applications of cerato-platanin proteins Particularly, the surface-activity-altering effects of CPPs are potentially interesting for biotechnological applications, but we are not aware of any ongoing efforts in this respect yet.

How Epstein-Barr virus envelope glycoprotein gp350 tricks the CR2? A molecular dynamics study. The connection of Epstein Barr virus (EBV) with diseases such as Burkitt Lymphoma, Hodgkin disease, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus and various B-cell lymphomas made EBV glycoproteins one of the most popular vaccine immunogens. As a protein being encoded by EBV, the viral membrane envelope protein gp350 is studied extensively due to its abundancy on the surface and its interaction with complementary receptor, CR2. The binding of CR2 and\nwidely spread pathogen associated with lymphoproliferative diseases, B/ T/ NK cell lymphomas, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and gastric carcinoma (GC). EBV lytic reactivations contribute to the genomic instability, inflammation and tumorigenesis of NPC, promoting cancer progression. Patients with NPC refractory to standard therapies show dismal survival. EBV gp350 is an envelope protein detectable in NPC specimens intracellularly and on the cell membrane of malignant cells, and is a potential viral antigen for T cell-directed immunotherapies. The potency of T cells engineered with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting gp350 against EBV+ lymphoproliferative disease was previously shown.Methods: Here, we advanced towards preclinical and non-clinical developments of this virus-specific CAR-T cell immunotherapy against NPC. Different gp350CAR designs were inserted into a lentiviral vector (LV) backbone.Results: A construct expressing the scFv 7A1-anti-gp350 incorporating the CD8 transmembrane and CD28.CD3\u03b6 signaling domain (ZT002) was selected. High titer ZT002 (~1x108 TU/ml) was manufactured in HEK 293T/17 suspension\npotential Epstein-Barr virus vaccine. Infectious mononucleosis and B-cell transformation in response to infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is dependent upon binding of the EBV envelope glycoprotein gp350 to CD21 on B-cells. Gp350-specific antibody comprises most of the EBV neutralizing activity in the serum of infected patients, making this protein a promising target antigen for a prophylactic EBV vaccine. We describe a novel, tetrameric gp350-based vaccine that exhibits markedly enhanced immunogenicity relative to its monomeric counterpart. Plasmid DNA was constructed for synthesis, within transfected CHO cells, of a tetrameric, truncated (a.a. 1-470) gp350 protein (gp350(1-470)). Tetrameric gp350(1-470) induced \u2248 20-fold higher serum titers of gp350(1-470)-specific IgG and >19-fold enhancements in neutralizing titers at the highest dose, and was >25-fold more immunogenic on a per-weight basis than monomeric gp350(1-470). Further, epidermal immunization with plasmid DNA encoding gp350(1-470) tetramer induced 8-fold higher serum titers of gp350(1-470)-specific IgG relative to monomer. Tetrameric gp350(1-470) binding\nfound to be accurate in differentiating the active site residues in CR2 binding. Here, we highlight the role of binding region residues (linker-1) but more interestingly, the dynamic relation between the distant sites of gp350 (linker-2 and D3 residues) and CR2. These findings can lead further vaccine development strategies by pointing to the importance of computationally found novel regions that can be potentially used to modulate gp350 activity. Structure of the Epstein-Barr virus major envelope glycoprotein. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection of B cells is associated with lymphoma and other human cancers. EBV infection is initiated by the binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein (gp350) to the cell surface receptor CR2. We determined the X-ray structure of the highly glycosylated gp350 and defined the CR2 binding site on gp350. Polyglycans shield all but one surface of the gp350 polypeptide, and we demonstrate that this glycan-free surface is the receptor-binding site. Deglycosylated\nopened by construction of random overlapping strongly immunogenic scrambled polypeptide(s). Further novel approaches are based on carefully selected antigenic peptides (oligopeptides) coming from both, structural as well as non-structural or latencyassociated proteins bound to suitable carriers. Any constructs based on latency-associated proteins might be useful either for immunoprophylactic therapy following bone marrow and/or heart transplantations or for the prevention of EBVrelated tumors such as lymphomas and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Due to the growing importance of the selected immunogenic epitopes as future vaccine components, at least the half of them has been patented not only as the natural amino acid sequence but also in different variations. Soluble gp350/220 and deletion mutant glycoproteins block Epstein-Barr virus adsorption to lymphocytes. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) major outer envelope glycoprotein complex, gp350/220, was known to be a ligand for CR2, a B-lymphocyte plasma membrane protein. By Scatchard analysis, soluble EBV gp350/220 binds with high affinity (KD,\nblood viral loads in primary infection and greater changes in viral diversity generated more efficient antibodies. Our findings provide insight into the generation of functional antibodies, necessary for vaccine development. Analysis of HIV-1 Matrix-Envelope Cytoplasmic Tail Interactions. The matrix (MA) domains of HIV-1 precursor Gag (PrGag) proteins direct PrGag proteins to plasma membrane (PM) assembly sites where envelope (Env) protein trimers are incorporated into virus particles. MA targeting to PM sites is facilitated by its binding to phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2], and MA binding to cellular RNAs appears to serve a chaperone function that prevents MA from associating with intracellular membranes prior to arrival at the PI(4,5)P2-rich PM. Investigations have shown genetic evidence of an interaction between MA and the cytoplasmic tails (CTs) of Env trimers that contributes to Env incorporation into virions, but demonstrations of direct MA-CT interactions have proven more difficult. In direct binding assays, we show here that MA\nby recognizing an epitope in the amino-terminal 470 (probably within the amino-terminal 162) amino acids and a deletion of amino-terminal amino acids 28 and 29 from gp350/220 inactivates ligand activity. EBV-gp350 confers B-cell tropism to tailored exosomes and is a neo-antigen in normal and malignant B cells--a new option for the treatment of B-CLL. gp350, the major envelope protein of Epstein-Barr-Virus, confers B-cell tropism to the virus by interacting with the B lineage marker CD21. Here we utilize gp350 to generate tailored exosomes with an identical tropism. These exosomes can be used for the targeted co-transfer of functional proteins to normal and malignant human B cells. We demonstrate here the co-transfer of functional CD154 protein on tailored gp350+ exosomes to malignant B blasts from patients with B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), rendering B blasts immunogenic to tumor-reactive autologous T cells. Intriguingly, engulfment of gp350+ exosomes by B-CLL cells and presentation\nto be closely associated with tumor development, such as lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and EBV-associated gastric carcinoma. Despite many efforts to develop prophylactic vaccines against EBV infection and diseases, no candidates have succeeded in effectively blocking EBV infection in clinical trials. Previous investigations showed that EBV gp350 plays a pivotal role in the infection of B-lymphocytes. Nevertheless, using monomeric gp350 proteins as antigens has not been effective in preventing infection. Multimeric forms of the antigen are more potently immunogenic than monomers; however, the multimerization elements used in previous constructs are not approved for human clinical trials. To prepare a much-needed EBV prophylactic vaccine that is potent, safe, and applicable, we constructed an Fc-based form of gp350 to serve as a dimeric antigen. Here, we show that the Fc-based gp350 antigen exhibits dramatically enhanced immunogenicity compared with wild-type gp350 protein. The complete or partial gp350 ectodomain was fused with the mouse IgG2a\nprotein trimers assemble into virus particles is poorly understood but involves an interaction between Env cytoplasmic tails (CTs) and the matrix (MA) domain of the structural precursor Gag (PrGag) proteins. We show here that direct binding of MA to Env CTs correlates with MA trimerization, suggesting models where MA lattices regulate CT interactions and/or MA-CT trimer-trimer associations increase the avidity of MA-CT binding. We also show that MA binding to RNA ligands impairs MA-CT binding, potentially by interfering with MA trimerization and/or directly or allosterically blocking MA-CT binding sites. Rough mapping implicated CT C-terminal helices in MA binding, in agreement with cell culture studies on MA-CT interactions. Our results indicate that targeting HIV-1 MA-CT interactions may be a promising avenue for antiviral therapy. A novel tetrameric gp350 1-470 as a potential Epstein-Barr virus vaccine. Infectious mononucleosis and B-cell transformation in response to infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is dependent upon\nvirions, but demonstrations of direct MA-CT interactions have proven more difficult. In direct binding assays, we show here that MA binds to Env CTs. Using MA mutants, matrix-capsid (MACA) proteins, and MA proteins incubated in the presence of inositol polyphosphate, we show a correlation between MA trimerization and CT binding. RNA ligands with high affinities for MA reduced MA-CT binding levels, suggesting that MA-RNA binding interferes with trimerization and/or directly or indirectly blocks MA-CT binding. Rough-mapping studies indicate that C-terminal CT helices are involved in MA binding and are in agreement with cell culture studies with replication-competent viruses. Our results support a model in which full-length HIV-1 Env trimers are captured in assembling PrGag lattices by virtue of their binding to MA trimers.IMPORTANCE The mechanism by which HIV-1 envelope (Env) protein trimers assemble into virus particles is poorly understood but involves an interaction between Env cytoplasmic tails (CTs) and the\ndramatically enhanced immunogenicity compared with wild-type gp350 protein. The complete or partial gp350 ectodomain was fused with the mouse IgG2a Fc domain. Fusion with the Fc domain did not impair gp350 folding, binding to a conformation-dependent neutralizing antibody (nAb) and binding to its receptor by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and surface plasmon resonance. Specific antibody titers against gp350 were notably enhanced by immunization with gp350-Fc dimers compared with gp350 monomers. Furthermore, immunization with gp350-Fc fusion proteins elicited potent nAbs against EBV. Our data strongly suggest that an EBV gp350 vaccine based on Fc fusion proteins may be an efficient candidate to prevent EBV infection in clinical applications. GMP development and preclinical validation of CAR-T cells targeting a lytic EBV antigen for therapy of EBV-associated malignancies. Introduction: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a widely spread pathogen associated with lymphoproliferative diseases, B/ T/ NK cell lymphomas, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and gastric carcinoma (GC). EBV\nimmunogenic proteins and their epitopes: implications for vaccine preparation. The Epstein-Barr virus (Human herpesvirus 4) encodes approximately 80 proteins, from which 15 possess at least 90 antigenic epitopes. Many of them stimulate the T cell receptors (TCR), but a few interact with the B cell receptors (BCR). Activation of B-cells and subsequent antibody production has not only been related to at least 3 envelope glycoproteins (mostly gp350) but also to latency associated membrane proteins (LMPs). The majority of EBV epitopes (over 80) inducing either cytotoxic and/or helper T lymphocytes were located on non-structural and/or latency associated polypeptides. The former interaction mediated by CD8plus/T cells is restricted by the HLA I molecules, predominantly of HLA-A subclass. In acute infectious mononucleosis (IM) patients (about 40 %) a considerable proportion of HLA B8 restricted CTL reactivity is directed against a single peptide (RAKFKQLL) of transactivator protein BZLF1/Zta. The EBV vaccines designed so far\nEpstein-Barr viruses that express a CD21 antibody provide evidence that gp350's functions extend beyond B-cell surface binding. The gp350 glycoprotein encoded by BLLF1 is crucial for efficient Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection of resting B cells. Gp350 binds to CD21, but whether this interaction sums up its functions remains unknown. We generated gp350-null EBVs that display CD19-, CD21-, or CD22-specific antibodies at their surface (designated as DeltaBLLF1-Ab). Gp350-complemented (DeltaBLLF1-C) and DeltaBLLF1-Ab were found to bind equally well to B cells. Surprisingly, DeltaBLLF1 binding was reduced only 1.7-fold relative to its complemented counterparts. Furthermore, B cells exposed to DeltaBLLF1-Ab or DeltaBLLF1 viruses presented structural antigens with comparable efficiency and achieved 25 to 80% of the T-cell activation elicited by DeltaBLLF1-C. These findings show that the gp350-CD21 interaction pair plays only a modest role during virus transfer to the endosomal compartment. However, primary B cells or Raji B cells infected with DeltaBLLF1-C viruses\nassociated with the development of neutralizing antibody responses following AIM.IMPORTANCE: Antibodies against viral surface proteins can blunt the spread of viral infection by coating viral particles, mediating uptake by immune cells, or blocking interaction with host cell receptors, making them a desirable component of a sterilizing vaccine. The EBV surface protein gp350 is a major target for antibodies. We report the detection of EBV gp350-specific antibodies capable of neutralizing EBV infection in vitro The majority of gp350-directed vaccines focus on glycoproteins from lab-adapted strains, which may poorly reflect primary viral envelope diversity. We report some of the first primary gp350 sequences, noting that the gp350 host receptor binding site is remarkably stable across patients and time. However, changes in overall gene diversity were detectable during infection. Patients with higher peripheral blood viral loads in primary infection and greater changes in viral diversity generated more efficient antibodies. Our findings provide insight\nto a similar extent. High Epstein-Barr Virus Load and Genomic Diversity Are Associated with Generation of gp350-Specific Neutralizing Antibodies following Acute Infectious Mononucleosis. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) gp350 glycoprotein interacts with the cellular receptor to mediate viral entry and is thought to be the major target for neutralizing antibodies. To better understand the role of EBV-specific antibodies in the control of viral replication and the evolution of sequence diversity, we measured EBV gp350-specific antibody responses and sequenced the gp350 gene in samples obtained from individuals experiencing primary EBV infection (acute infectious mononucleosis [AIM]) and again 6 months later (during convalescence [CONV]). EBV gp350-specific IgG was detected in the sera of 17 (71%) of 24 individuals at the time of AIM and all 24 (100%) individuals during CONV; binding antibody titers increased from AIM through CONV, reaching levels equivalent to those in age-matched, chronically infected individuals. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP) was\na ligand for CR2, a B-lymphocyte plasma membrane protein. By Scatchard analysis, soluble EBV gp350/220 binds with high affinity (KD, 1.2 x 10(-8) M) to approximately the same number of B-lymphocyte surface sites as do CR2-specific monoclonal antibodies. Soluble gp350, gp220, or an amino-terminal, 576-amino-acid gp220 derivative binds similarly to B-lymphocyte receptors. Soluble gp350/220, gp220, or even a 470-amino-acid, amino-terminal gp220 derivative blocks EBV adsorption or infection. These experiments demonstrate that (i) gp350/220 is the predominant or exclusive EBV ligand for B lymphocytes; (ii) ligand-receptor blockade can prevent lymphocyte infection by EBV; and (iii) the amino-terminal, 470-amino-acid domain of gp350/220 contains the key ligand domain(s). Consistent with the ligand domain(s) being in the amino-terminal half of gp220 are the findings that the gp350/220-specific, EBV-neutralizing monoclonal antibody 72A1 blocks EBV adsorption by recognizing an epitope in the amino-terminal 470 (probably within the amino-terminal 162) amino acids and a deletion of amino-terminal\n(B-CLL), rendering B blasts immunogenic to tumor-reactive autologous T cells. Intriguingly, engulfment of gp350+ exosomes by B-CLL cells and presentation of gp350-derived peptides also re-stimulated EBV-specific T cells and redirected the strong antiviral cellular immune response in patients to leukemic B cells. In essence, we show that gp350 alone confers B-cell tropism to exosomes and that these exosomes can be further engineered to simultaneously trigger virus- and tumor-specific immune responses. The simultaneous exploitation of gp350 as a tropism molecule for tailored exosomes and as a neo-antigen in malignant B cells provides a novel attractive strategy for immunotherapy of B-CLL and other B-cell malignancies. Immunization With Fc-Based Recombinant Epstein-Barr Virus gp350 Elicits Potent Neutralizing Humoral Immune Response in a BALB/c Mice Model. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was the first human virus proved to be closely associated with tumor development, such as lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and EBV-associated gastric carcinoma. Despite many efforts to\nwith plasmid DNA encoding gp350(1-470) tetramer induced 8-fold higher serum titers of gp350(1-470)-specific IgG relative to monomer. Tetrameric gp350(1-470) binding to human CD21 was >24-fold more efficient on a per-weight basis than monomer, but neither tetramer nor monomer mediated polyclonal human B-cell activation. Finally, the introduction of strong, universal tetanus toxoid (TT)-specific CD4+ T-cell epitopes into the tetrameric gp350(1-470) had no effect on the gp350(1-470)-specific IgG response in na\u00efve mice, and resulted in suppressed gp350(1-470)-specific IgG responses in TT-primed mice. Collectively, these data suggest that tetrameric gp350(1-470) is a potentially promising candidate for testing as a prophylactic EBV vaccine, and that protein multimerization, using the approach described herein, is likely to be clinically relevant for enhancing the immunogenicity of other proteins of vaccine interest. Survey of Epstein Barr virus (EBV) immunogenic proteins and their epitopes: implications for vaccine preparation. The Epstein-Barr virus (Human herpesvirus 4) encodes approximately 80 proteins, from\nrestricted CTL reactivity is directed against a single peptide (RAKFKQLL) of transactivator protein BZLF1/Zta. The EBV vaccines designed so far fall into two categories: those preventing any kind of infection (including prophylaxis of EBVassociated malignancies) and those designed for therapeutic purposes (to be used in subjects already infected). Preventive vaccines protecting against acute disease (such as IM) contain, as a rule, the gp350 polypeptide(s) encoded by the BLLF1 gene. Vaccines destined for tumor prevention rather consist of peptides derived from latency associated nuclear proteins (EBNA 2, 3 and 6) and/or from oncogenic latent membrane proteins (LMP1/LMP2a). Whereas the former generates antibodies preventing virus entry, the latter would potentiate the cell mediated response. In addition to recently described and purified individual recombinant immunogenic EBV polypeptides and/or their mixes, new perspectives were opened by construction of random overlapping strongly immunogenic scrambled polypeptide(s). Further novel approaches are based on carefully selected antigenic peptides\nall but one surface of the gp350 polypeptide, and we demonstrate that this glycan-free surface is the receptor-binding site. Deglycosylated gp350 bound CR2 similarly to the glycosylated form, suggesting that glycosylation is not important for receptor binding. Structure-guided mutagenesis of the glycan-free surface disrupted receptor binding as well as binding by a gp350 monoclonal antibody, a known inhibitor of virus-receptor interactions. These results provide structural information for developing drugs and vaccines to prevent infection by EBV and related viruses.",

Global functional atlas of Escherichia coli encompassing previously uncharacterized proteins. One-third of the 4,225 protein-coding genes of Escherichia coli K-12 remain functionally unannotated (orphans). Many map to distant clades such as Archaea, suggesting involvement in basic prokaryotic traits, whereas others appear restricted to E. coli, including pathogenic strains. To elucidate the orphans' biological roles, we performed an extensive proteomic survey using affinity-tagged E. coli strains and generated comprehensive genomic context inferences to derive a high-confidence compendium for virtually the entire proteome consisting of 5,993 putative physical interactions and 74,776 putative functional associations, most of which are novel. Clustering of the respective probabilistic networks revealed putative orphan membership in discrete multiprotein complexes and functional modules together with annotated gene products, whereas a machine-learning strategy\nhave the capacity to associate with other proteins, and a complex formation of c-Ski with itself, SnoN, and uncharacterized proteins might play a key role in the function of Ski. YML018C protein localizes to the vacuolar membrane independently of Atg27p. The function of the budding yeast YML018C protein remains to be determined. High-throughput studies have reported that the YML018C protein localizes to the vacuolar membrane and physically interacts with the autophagy-related protein Atg27p. While this evidence suggests a potential role for this uncharacterized protein in the process of autophagy, the function of this putative interaction remains uncharacterized. In this micropublication, we report our finding that the localization of the YML018C protein to the vacuolar membrane does not require Atg27p. Ensemble non-negative matrix factorization methods for clustering protein-protein interactions. MOTIVATION: When working with large-scale protein interaction data, an important analysis task is the assignment of pairs of proteins to groups that\ntail. We used proximity biotinylation and quantitative proteomics to identify 561 proteins in the vicinity of the cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin. In addition, we used proteomics to identify proteins associated with E-cadherin-containing adhesion plaques from a cell-glass interface, which enabled the assignment of cellular localization to putative E-cadherin-interacting proteins. Moreover, by tagging identified proteins with GFP (green fluorescent protein), we determined the subcellular localization of 83 putative E-cadherin-proximal proteins and identified 24 proteins that were previously uncharacterized as part of adherens junctions. We constructed and characterized a comprehensive E-cadherin interaction network of 79 published and 394 previously uncharacterized proteins using a structure-informed database of protein-protein interactions. Finally, we found that calcium chelation, which disrupts the interaction of the extracellular E-cadherin domains, did not disrupt most intracellular protein interactions with E-cadherin, suggesting that the E-cadherin intracellular interactome is predominantly independent of cell-cell adhesion. Discovery of novel interacting partners of PSMD9, a\nacids, is applicable to proteins from any sequenced organism and can be used to compensate for the lack of domain information.RESULTS: AAC performed at par with protein interaction prediction based on domains on three yeast protein interaction datasets. Similar behavior was obtained using different classifiers, indicating that our results are a function of features and not of classifiers. In addition to yeast datasets, AAC performed comparably on worm and fly datasets. Prediction of interactions for the entire yeast proteome identified a large number of novel interactions, the majority of which co-localized or participated in the same processes. Our high confidence interaction network included both well-studied and uncharacterized proteins. Proteins with known function were involved in actin assembly and cell budding. Uncharacterized proteins interacted with proteins involved in reproduction and cell budding, thus providing putative biological roles for the uncharacterized proteins.CONCLUSION: AAC is a simple, yet powerful feature for predicting protein\nbudding, thus providing putative biological roles for the uncharacterized proteins.CONCLUSION: AAC is a simple, yet powerful feature for predicting protein interactions, and can be used alone or in conjunction with protein domains to predict new and validate existing interactions. More importantly, AAC alone performs at par with existing, but more complex, features indicating the presence of sequence-level information that is predictive of interaction, but which is not necessarily restricted to domains. Structure and function of yeast Atg20, a sorting nexin that facilitates autophagy induction. The Atg20 and Snx4/Atg24 proteins have been identified in a screen for mutants defective in a type of selective macroautophagy/autophagy. Both proteins are connected to the Atg1 kinase complex, which is involved in autophagy initiation, and bind phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate. Atg20 and Snx4 contain putative BAR domains, suggesting a possible role in membrane deformation, but they have been relatively uncharacterized. Here we demonstrate that, in addition to its\nbiochemical properties are unclear. C-Ski can bind to DNA only in association with uncharacterized protein(s). A lambda gt11 cDNA library was screened with the biotinylated Ski to isolate genes encoding proteins capable of forming complexes with Ski. Two clones encoding Ski itself or the ski-related gene product SnoN were isolated in this manner, suggesting that Ski can form a complex with Ski itself or with SnoN. Trimerization of Ski with itself and SnoN was also confirmed by protein cross-linking and protein blot analysis. The carboxyl-terminal 1/5 regions of Ski and SnoN are required for complex formation. This region has a homology between two proteins and two putative leucine zipper-like structures, suggesting that these leucine zipper-like structures mediate trimerization by making side-to-side interactions between the conserved leucines. Thus, Ski and SnoN have the capacity to associate with other proteins, and a complex formation of c-Ski with itself, SnoN, and uncharacterized proteins\ndeficiency in media that requires aerobic metabolism. Impaired mitochondrial function and overall reduction of ergosterol content in the YER067W deleted strain explained the observed 2- and 4-fold increase in resistance to the drugs fluconazole and amphotericin B, respectively. Cell fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that Yer067w is associated with cellular membranes despite the absence of a transmembrane domain in the protein. Finally, the 1.7 A resolution crystal structure of Yer067w shows an alpha-beta fold with low similarity to known structures and a putative functional site.YER067W's involvement with aerobic energetic metabolism suggests the assignment of the gene name RGI1, standing for respiratory growth induced 1. Altogether, the results shed light on a previously uncharacterized protein family and provide basis for further studies of its apparent role in energy metabolism control and drug resistance. Annotation and curation of uncharacterized proteins- challenges. Hypothetical proteins (HPs) are the proteins predicted to be expressed from\nantigen had not yet been identified, was screened. This antibody was generated by immunizing with a nuclear extract of Jurkat cells and was detected in immunohistochemistry due to its distinctive nuclear staining of lymphoid tissue cells. However, its molecular target had remained unidentified using traditional approaches. A protein array screen rapidly identified the mitotic spindle-associated molecule NUMA1 (nuclear mitotic apparatus protein 1). To confirm this putative specificity, JJ166 was shown to react with COS-1 cells transiently transfected with the complementary DNA for NUMA1. Furthermore, a commercially available antibody against NUMA1 showed nearly identical staining in immunohistochemistry on human tissue and cells. Overall, this method represents an effective and quick strategy for defining the protein targets of new or uncharacterized monoclonal antibodies identified as having diagnostic or other potential value on the basis of their immunostaining patterns. Structural and functional study of YER067W, a new protein involved in yeast metabolism control\nshape and 26 additional genes that further modify H. pylori's cell morphology.IMPORTANCE The stomach ulcer and cancer-causing pathogen Helicobacter pylori has a helical cell shape which facilitates stomach infection. Using light scattering to measure perturbations of cell morphology, we identified 28 genes that influence different aspects of cell shape. A mutant in a previously uncharacterized protein renamed Csd7 failed to form any helical cells. Biochemical analyses showed that Csd7 collaborates with other proteins to stabilize the cell wall-degrading enzyme Csd1. Csd7 also links Csd1 with a putative filament-forming protein via protein-protein interactions. These data suggest that helical cell shape arises from a highly orchestrated program to regulate cell wall modifications. Targeting of this helical cell shape-promoting program could offer new ways to block infectivity of this important human pathogen.

Annotation and curation of uncharacterized proteins- challenges. Hypothetical proteins (HPs) are the proteins predicted to be expressed from an open reading frame, making a substantial fraction of proteomes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Genome projects have led to the identification of many therapeutic targets, the putative function of the protein, and their interactions. In this review we enlist various methods linking annotation to structural and functional prediction of HPs that assist in the discovery of new structures and functions serving as markers and pharmacological targets for drug designing, discovery, and screening. Further we give an overview of how mass spectrometry as an analytical technique is used to validate protein characterisation. We discuss how microarrays and protein expression profiles help understanding the biological systems through a systems-wide study of proteins and their interactions with other proteins and non-proteinaceous molecules to control complex processes in cells. Finally, we articulate challenges\nworking with large-scale protein interaction data, an important analysis task is the assignment of pairs of proteins to groups that correspond to higher order assemblies. Previously a common approach to this problem has been to apply standard hierarchical clustering methods to identify such a groups. Here we propose a new algorithm for aggregating a diverse collection of matrix factorizations to produce a more informative clustering, which takes the form of a 'soft' hierarchy of clusters.RESULTS: We apply the proposed Ensemble non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm to a high-quality assembly of binary protein interactions derived from two proteome-wide studies in yeast. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the algorithm lends itself to discovering small localized structures in this data, which correspond to known functional groupings of complexes. In addition, we show that the algorithm also supports the assignment of putative functions for previously uncharacterized proteins, for instance the protein YNR024W, which may\nmutant collection were two that failed to form any helical cells, a soluble lytic transglycosylase and a previously uncharacterized putative multipass inner membrane protein HPG27_0728, renamed Csd7. A combination of cell fractionation, mutational, and immunoprecipitation experiments show that Csd7 and Csd2 collaborate to stabilize the Csd1 peptidoglycan (PG) endopeptidase. Thus, both csd2 and csd7 mutants show the same enhancement of PG tetra-pentapeptide cross-linking as csd1 mutants. Csd7 also links Csd1 with the bactofilin CcmA via protein-protein interactions. Although Csd1 is stable in ccmA mutants, these mutants show altered PG tetra-pentapeptide cross-linking, suggesting that Csd7 may directly or indirectly activate as well as stabilize Csd1. These data begin to illuminate a highly orchestrated program to regulate PG modifications that promote helical shape, which includes nine nonessential nonredundant genes required for helical shape and 26 additional genes that further modify H. pylori's cell morphology.IMPORTANCE The stomach ulcer and cancer-causing pathogen Helicobacter pylori\na possible role in membrane deformation, but they have been relatively uncharacterized. Here we demonstrate that, in addition to its function in selective autophagy, Atg20 plays a critical role in the efficient induction of nonselective autophagy. Atg20 is a dynamic posttranslationally modified protein that engages both structurally stable (PX and BAR) and intrinsically disordered domains for its function. In addition to its PX and BAR domains, Atg20 uses a third membrane-binding module, a membrane-inducible amphipathic helix present in a previously undescribed location in Atg20 within the putative BAR domain. Taken together, these findings yield insights into the molecular mechanism of the autophagy machinery.\nThe Rosetta stone method. Analysis of amino acid sequences from different organisms often reveals cases in which two or more proteins encoded for separately in a genome also appear as fusions, either in the same genome or that of some other organism. Such fusion proteins, termed Rosetta stone sequences, help link disparate proteins together, and suggest the likelihood of functional interactions between the linked entities, describing local and global relationships within the proteome. These relationships help us understand the role of proteins within the context of their associations, and facilitate assignment of putative functions to uncharacterized proteins based on their linkages with proteins of known function. Complex formation between proteins encoded by the ski gene family. The c-ski proto-oncogene product (c-Ski) is localized in the nuclei, but its function and biochemical properties are unclear. C-Ski can bind to DNA only in association with uncharacterized protein(s). A lambda gt11 cDNA library\ndynamic changes in expression upon cardiomyogenic differentiation mostly opposed those during dedifferentiation. Among the genes whose expression increased during differentiation and decreased during dedifferentiation were many with known (lineage-specific) functions in cardiac muscle formation. Filtering for cardiac-enriched low-abundance transcripts, identified multiple genes with an uncharacterized role during cardio(myo)genesis including Sbk2 (SH3 domain binding kinase family member 2). Sbk2 encodes an evolutionarily conserved putative serine/threonine protein kinase, whose expression is strongly up- and downregulated during iAM-1 cell differentiation and dedifferentiation, respectively. In neonatal and adult rats, the protein is muscle-specific, highly atrium-enriched, and localized around the A-band of cardiac sarcomeres. Knockdown of Sbk2 expression caused loss of sarcomeric organization in NRAMs, iAMs and their human counterparts, consistent with a decrease in sarcomeric gene expression as evinced by transcriptome and proteome analyses. Interestingly, co-immunoprecipitation using Sbk2 as bait identified possible interaction partners with diverse cellular functions (translation, intracellular trafficking, cytoskeletal organization, chromatin\nrevealed putative orphan membership in discrete multiprotein complexes and functional modules together with annotated gene products, whereas a machine-learning strategy based on network integration implicated the orphans in specific biological processes. We provide additional experimental evidence supporting orphan participation in protein synthesis, amino acid metabolism, biofilm formation, motility, and assembly of the bacterial cell envelope. This resource provides a \"systems-wide\" functional blueprint of a model microbe, with insights into the biological and evolutionary significance of previously uncharacterized proteins. E-cadherin interactome complexity and robustness resolved by quantitative proteomics. E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion and signaling plays an essential role in development and maintenance of healthy epithelial tissues. Adhesiveness mediated by E-cadherin is conferred by its extracellular cadherin domains and is regulated by an assembly of intracellular adaptors and enzymes associated with its cytoplasmic tail. We used proximity biotinylation and quantitative proteomics to identify 561 proteins in the vicinity of the cytoplasmic tail of\nfH = ([\u03b8]222\u22123000)/(\u221236000\u22123000) (Appendix Eq.(1)), where [\u03b8]222 is mean molar residual ellipticity at 222 nm. Defining the molecular target of an antibody derived from nuclear extract of Jurkat cells using protein arrays. Many diagnostic antibodies are generated by immunization with whole cells or cell extracts and are shown by screening on tissue sections to label specific cell populations. However, their target molecule then needs to be identified, and this can be technically demanding. Here we describe the use of protein arrays to define the targets of new or uncharacterized monoclonal antibodies. The technique involves screening protein arrays containing thousands of recombinant human proteins. An initial experiment showed that a well-characterized monoclonal antibody against nucleophosmin identified 22 clones on the array encoding this protein. Next, the antibody JJ166, for which the antigen had not yet been identified, was screened. This antibody was generated by immunizing with a nuclear extract of Jurkat\nPSMD9 in transcriptional regulation, mRNA processing and editing, hormone and receptor activity and protein translation. Our proof-of-principle experiments endorse a novel and quick method for the identification of putative interacting partners of similar PDZ-domain proteins from the proteome and for discovering novel functions. Introduction Almost every cellular pathway involved in the biology and homeostasis of a eukaryotic organism is regulated by the Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS). Impairment in the function of UPS components results in the accumulation of proteins leading to cellular stress and apoptosis. While the role of proteasome in normal biology and disease is by and large well studied, the precise mechanism, the sequence and the structural requirements for substrate recognition, direct and indirect protein\u2013protein interactions required for recruiting a substrate to the proteasome, remain obscure. The structure and the domain functions of various 19S subunits and their role in proteasome dependent and independent functions are unclear. We\nthe basis of their immunostaining patterns. Structural and functional study of YER067W, a new protein involved in yeast metabolism control and drug resistance. The genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is arguably the best studied eukaryotic genome, and yet, it contains approximately 1000 genes that are still relatively uncharacterized. As the majority of these ORFs have no homologs with characterized sequence or protein structure, traditional sequence-based approaches cannot be applied to deduce their biological function. Here, we characterize YER067W, a conserved gene of unknown function that is strongly induced in response to many stress conditions and repressed in drug resistant yeast strains. Gene expression patterns of YER067W and its paralog YIL057C suggest an involvement in energy metabolism. We show that yeast lacking YER067W display altered levels of reserve carbohydrates and a growth deficiency in media that requires aerobic metabolism. Impaired mitochondrial function and overall reduction of ergosterol content in the YER067W deleted\nas described in (A) The dissociation constants (Kd) for the interaction of SCGF with PSMD9, L153G and F162G were found to be 8.6 \u00b1 1.2 \u03bcM, 44.4 \u00b1 5.7 \u03bcM and 21.6 \u00b1 2.49 \u03bcM , respectively. Measurements were done in duplicates and data is represented as mean \u00b1 SD (SD-standard deviation) for two independent experiments. A putative two site binding model for the interaction of PSMD9 with its interacting partners. Model shows the possible mechanism of binding of PSMD9 to its interacting partners (hnRNPA1 used as an example). Model is based on the following facts. Kd for the C-terminal peptide is very high (\u223c650 \u03bcM) while that of protein is low (\u223c1 \u03bcM). This discrepancy is better explained by the presence of a secondary binding site in protein. This speculation draws support from the fact that the C-terminal deletions do not completely inhibit binding of proteins to PSMD9. These",

There are no direct contacts between the VSDs of the four subunits, and the contacts between these and the PDs are loose, suggesting that the VSDs are capable of functioning independently. Indeed, they manifest many inherent fluctuations that are decoupled from the rest of the structure. In general, the analysis suggests that the two domains contribute to the channel function both individually and cooperatively. Structural and functional characterization of Kv6.2 a new gamma-subunit of voltage-gated potassium channel. We have cloned and functionally expressed Kv6.2, a new member of the Kv6 subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channel subunits. The human Kv6.2 (KCNF2) gene was mapped at 18q22-18q23. Kv6.2 mRNA is preferentially expressed in rat and human myocard. Rat and human Kv6.2 subunits appear to be unable to form functional Kv channels in\npore coupling. Our work exposes the multigenic, molecular etiology of a variant associated with epilepsy and reveals that charge-transfer-center disruption has different effects in KV1.2 and Shaker, the archetypes for potassium channel structure and function. The Kv\u03b22 subunit of voltage-gated potassium channels is interacting with ProSAP2/Shank3 in the PSD. The postsynaptic density is an electron dense meshwork composed of a variety of molecules facilitating neuronal signal transmission. ProSAP2/Shank3 represents a crucial player at postsynaptic sites, assembling large multimeric platforms and anchoring numerous other molecules, thereby linking the functional synapse with the cytoskeleton. ProSAP2/Shank3 is also implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including autism spectrum disorders. KvBeta2 (Kv\u03b22) on the other hand serves as a regulatory subunit of voltage-gated potassium channels. Kv\u03b22 is located at various sites in the neuron including the axon (binding to Kv1.2), the dendrites (binding to Kv4.2) and the synapse. Binding of Kv\u03b22 to either Kv1.2\nalpha subunit contains six transmembrane segments, including an intrinsic voltage sensor. In contrast, inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels have just two transmembrane segments in each of its four pore-lining alpha subunits. A variety of intracellular second messengers mediate transmitter and metabolic regulation of Kir channels. For example, Kir3 (GIRK) channels open on binding to the G protein betagamma subunits, thereby mediating slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in the brain. Our structure-based functional analysis on the cytoplasmic N-terminal tetramerization domain T1 of the voltage-gated channel, Kv1.2, uncovered a new function for this domain, modulation of voltage gating, and suggested a possible means of communication between second messenger pathways and Kv channels. A yeast screen for active Kir3.2 channels subjected to random mutagenesis has identified residues in the transmembrane segments that are crucial for controlling the opening of Kir3.2 channels. The identification of structural elements involved in potassium channel gating in these systems\nthe excitatory/inhibitory balance of neuronal circuits. Independent and cooperative motions of the Kv1.2 channel: voltage sensing and gating. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels, such as Kv1.2, are involved in the generation and propagation of action potentials. The Kv channel is a homotetramer, and each monomer is composed of a voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and a pore domain (PD). We analyzed the fluctuations of a model structure of Kv1.2 using elastic network models. The analysis suggested a network of coupled fluctuations of eight rigid structural units and seven hinges that may control the transition between the active and inactive states of the channel. For the most part, the network is composed of amino acids that are known to affect channel activity. The results suggested allosteric interactions and cooperativity between the subunits in the coupling between the motion of the VSD and the selectivity filter of the PD, in accordance with recent empirical data.\ninfancy and results from point mutations in the voltage-gated potassium channel gene hKv1.1. The hallmark of the disease is continuous myokymia and episodic attacks of spastic contractions of the skeletal muscles, which cause permanent disability. Coexpression of hKv1.1 and hKv1.2 subunits produces heteromeric potassium channels with biophysical and pharmacological properties intermediate between the respective homomers. By using tandemly linked subunits, we demonstrate that hKv1.1 subunits bearing the EA-1 mutations V408A and E325D combine with hKv1.2 to produce channels with altered kinetics of activation, deactivation, C-type inactivation, and voltage dependence. Moreover, hKv1.1V408A single-channel analysis reveals a approximately threefold reduction of the mean open duration of the channel compared with the wild-type, and this mutation alters the open-state stability of both homomeric and heteromeric channels. The results demonstrate that human Kv1.2 and Kv1.1 subunits coassemble to form a novel channel with distinct gating properties that are altered profoundly by EA-1 mutations, thus\na similar bidirectional regulation as in the Cav channels. The two effects could be distinguished kinetically, in terms of their sensitivities to PIP(2) and by distinct molecular determinants. The rightward shift of the Kv1.2 voltage dependence implicated basic residues in the S4-S5 linker and was consistent with stabilization of the inactive state of the voltage sensor. A third type of a voltage-gated ion channel modulated by PIP(2) is the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel. PIP(2) has been shown to enhance the opening of HCN channels by shifting their voltage-dependent activation toward depolarized potentials. The sea urchin HCN channel, SpIH, showed again a PIP(2)-mediated bidirectional effect but in reverse order than the depolarization-activated Cav and Kv channels: a voltage-dependent potentiation, like the mammalian HCN channels, but also an inhibition of the cGMP-induced current activation. Just like the Kv1.2 channels, distinct molecular determinants underlied the PIP(2) dual effects on SpIH, with the\nin mice lacking the potassium channel subunit Kv1.2, but hypoexcitability and enlarged Kv1 currents in auditory neurons. Genes Kcna1 and Kcna2 code for the voltage-dependent potassium channel subunits Kv1.1 and Kv1.2, which are coexpressed in large axons and commonly present within the same tetramers. Both contribute to the low-voltage-activated potassium current I Kv1, which powerfully limits excitability and facilitates temporally precise transmission of information, e.g., in auditory neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Kcna1-null mice lacking Kv1.1 exhibited seizure susceptibility and hyperexcitability in axons and MNTB neurons, which also had reduced I Kv1. To explore whether a lack of Kv1.2 would cause a similar phenotype, we created and characterized Kcna2-null mice (-/-). The -/- mice exhibited increased seizure susceptibility compared with their +/+ and +/- littermates, as early as P14. The mRNA for Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 increased strongly in +/+ brain stems between P7 and P14,\nmight be able to fine-tune their excitability by adjusting the Kv1.1:Kv1.2 balance rather than altering Kv1 channel density. The glycosylation state of Kv1.2 potassium channels affects trafficking, gating, and simulated action potentials. We presented evidence previously that decreasing the glycosylation state of the Kv1.1 potassium channel modified its gating by a combined surface potential and a cooperative subunit interaction mechanism and these effects modified simulated action potentials. Here we continued to test the hypothesis that glycosylation affects channel function in a predictable fashion by increasing and decreasing the glycosylation state of Kv1.2 channels. Compared with Kv1.2, increasing the glycosylation state shifted the V(1/2) negatively with a steeper G-V slope, increased activation kinetics with little change in deactivation kinetics or in their voltage-dependence, and decreased the apparent level of C-type inactivation. Decreasing the glycosylation state had essentially the opposite effects and shifted the V(1/2) positively with a shallower G-V slope, decreased\nThe glycosylation state of Kv1.2 also affected action potentials in simulations. In addition, preventing N-glycosylation decreased cell surface Kv1.2 expression levels by approximately 40% primarily by increasing partial endoplasmic reticulum retention and this effect was completely rescued by Kv1.4 subunits, which are glycosylated, but not by cytoplasmic Kvbeta2.1 subunits. The nonglycosylated Kv1.2 protein had a similar protein half-life as the glycosylated protein and appeared to be folded properly. Thus altering the native Kv1.2 glycosylation state affected its trafficking, gating, and simulated action potentials. Differential glycosylation of ion channels could be used by excitable cells to modify cell signaling. Mutations in the KCNA1 gene associated with episodic ataxia type-1 syndrome impair heteromeric voltage-gated K(+) channel function. Episodic ataxia type-1 syndrome (EA-1) is an autosomal dominant neurological disorder that manifests itself during infancy and results from point mutations in the voltage-gated potassium channel gene hKv1.1. The hallmark of the disease is continuous\n16 years, there has been an impressive number of ion channels shown to be sensitive to the major phosphoinositide in the plasma membrane, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)). Among them are voltage-gated channels, which are crucial for both neuronal and cardiac excitability. Voltage-gated calcium (Cav) channels were shown to be regulated bidirectionally by PIP(2). On one hand, PIP(2) stabilized their activity by reducing current rundown but on the other hand it produced a voltage-dependent inhibition by shifting the activation curve to more positive voltages. For voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels PIP(2) was first shown to prevent N-type inactivation regardless of whether the fast inactivation gate was part of the pore-forming \u03b1 subunit or of an accessory \u03b2 subunit. Careful examination of the effects of PIP(2) on the activation mechanism of Kv1.2 has shown a similar bidirectional regulation as in the Cav channels. The two effects could be distinguished kinetically, in terms of their\nvoltage-sensing domain of KV1.2-F302L channels is more sensitive to depolarization. Accordingly, KV1.2-F302L channels opened faster and at more negative potentials; however, they also exhibited enhanced inactivation: that is, F302L causes both gain- and loss-of-function effects. Coexpression of KCNA2-WT and -F302L did not fully rescue these effects. The proband's symptoms are more characteristic of patients with loss of KCNA2 function. Enhanced KV1.2 inactivation could lead to increased synaptic release in excitatory neurons, steering neuronal circuits towards epilepsy.ABSTRACT: An exome-based diagnostic panel in an infant with epilepsy revealed a previously unreported de novo missense variant in KCNA2, which encodes voltage-gated K+ channel KV1.2. This variant causes substitution F302L, in helix S4 of the KV1.2 voltage-sensing domain (VSD). F302L does not affect KCNA2 subunit membrane trafficking. However, it does alter channel functional properties, accelerating channel opening at more hyperpolarized membrane potentials, indicating gain of function. F302L also caused loss of KV1.2 function via\naccelerating channel opening at more hyperpolarized membrane potentials, indicating gain of function. F302L also caused loss of KV1.2 function via accelerated inactivation onset, decelerated recovery and shifted inactivation voltage dependence to more negative potentials. These effects, which are not fully rescued by coexpression of wild-type and mutant KCNA2 subunits, probably result from the enhancement of VSD function, as demonstrated by optically tracking VSD depolarization-evoked conformational rearrangements. In turn, molecular dynamics simulations suggest altered VSD exposure to membrane lipids. Compared to other encephalopathy patients with KCNA2 mutations, the proband exhibits mild neurological impairment, more characteristic of patients with KCNA2 loss of function. Based on this information, we propose a mechanism of epileptogenesis based on enhanced KV1.2 inactivation leading to increased synaptic release preferentially in excitatory neurons, and hence the perturbation of the excitatory/inhibitory balance of neuronal circuits. Independent and cooperative motions of the Kv1.2 channel: voltage sensing and gating. Voltage-gated potassium\ncGMP-induced current activation. Just like the Kv1.2 channels, distinct molecular determinants underlied the PIP(2) dual effects on SpIH, with the proximal C-terminus implicated in the inhibitory effect. The dual regulation of these very different ion channels, all of which are voltage-dependent, points to conserved mechanisms of regulation of these channels by PIP(2). Impact of ancillary subunits on ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels generate the outward K(+) ion currents that constitute the primary force in ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium channels comprise tetramers of pore-forming alpha subunits and, in probably most cases in vivo, ancillary or beta subunits that help define the properties of the Kv current generated. Ancillary subunits can be broadly categorized as cytoplasmic or transmembrane and can modify Kv channel trafficking, conductance, gating, ion selectivity, regulation, and pharmacology. Because of their often profound effects on Kv channel function, studies of the molecular correlates of ventricular repolarization must take\nfor controlling the opening of Kir3.2 channels. The identification of structural elements involved in potassium channel gating in these systems highlights principles that may be important in the regulation of other types of channels. Notch enhances Ca2+ entry by activating calcium-sensing receptors and inhibiting voltage-gated K+ channels. The increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) and upregulation of calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) and stromal interaction molecule 2 (STIM2) along with inhibition of voltage-gated K+ (KV) channels in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMC) have been implicated in the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension; however, the precise upstream mechanisms remain elusive. Activation of CaSR, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), results in Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR) and Ca2+ influx through receptor-operated and store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOC). Upon Ca2+ depletion from the SR, STIM forms clusters to mediate store-operated Ca2+ entry. Activity of KV channels, like KCNA5/KV1.5 and KCNA2/KV1.2, contributes to regulating\nnovel mutation in the shaker type voltage-gated potassium channel KCNA2 (CCDS_827.1: c.765_773del; p.255_257del). A rare missense SCN2A (rs200884216) variant was also found in 2 affected siblings and their unaffected mother. The p.255_257del mutation caused dominant negative loss of channel function. Molecular modeling predicted repositioning of critical arginine residues in the voltage-sensing domain. KCNA2 sequencing revealed 1 de novo mutation (CCDS_827.1: c.890G>A; p.Arg297Gln) in a girl with EE, ataxia, and tremor.CONCLUSIONS: A KCNA2 mutation caused dominantly inherited episodic ataxia, mild infantile-onset seizures, and later generalized and focal epilepsies in the setting of normal intellect. This observation expands the KCNA2 phenotypic spectrum from EE often associated with chronic ataxia, reflecting the marked variation in severity observed in many ion channel disorders. Dual Regulation of Voltage-Sensitive Ion Channels by PIP(2). Over the past 16 years, there has been an impressive number of ion channels shown to be sensitive to the major phosphoinositide in\nthe S1 segment of the voltage sensor in one subunit and both the S5 segment and top of the pore helix from another subunit. This interface evidently plays an important role in channel gating. Controlling potassium channel activities: Interplay between the membrane and intracellular factors. Neural signaling is based on the regulated timing and extent of channel opening; therefore, it is important to understand how ion channels open and close in response to neurotransmitters and intracellular messengers. Here, we examine this question for potassium channels, an extraordinarily diverse group of ion channels. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels control action-potential waveforms and neuronal firing patterns by opening and closing in response to membrane-potential changes. These effects can be strongly modulated by cytoplasmic factors such as kinases, phosphatases, and small GTPases. A Kv alpha subunit contains six transmembrane segments, including an intrinsic voltage sensor. In contrast, inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels have just\nand design of specific current-targeted compounds. Here, we discuss current thinking and lines of experimentation aimed at resolving the complexities of the Kv channel complexes that repolarize the human ventricular myocardium. Structural models for the KCNQ1 voltage-gated potassium channel. Mutations in the human voltage-gated potassium channel KCNQ1 are associated with predisposition to deafness and various cardiac arrhythmia syndromes including congenital long QT syndrome, familial atrial fibrillation, and sudden infant death syndrome. In this work 3-D structural models were developed for both the open and closed states of human KCNQ1 to facilitate structurally based hypotheses regarding mutation-phenotype relationships. The KCNQ1 open state was modeled using Rosetta in conjunction with Molecular Operating Environment software, and is based primarily on the recently determined open state structure of rat Kv1.2 (Long, S. B., et al. (2005) Science 309, 897-903). The closed state model for KCNQ1 was developed based on the crystal structures of bacterial\nKv1.1 subunits coassemble to form a novel channel with distinct gating properties that are altered profoundly by EA-1 mutations, thus uncovering novel physiopathogenetic mechanisms of episodic ataxia type-1 myokymia syndrome. Tracking the motion of the KV1.2 voltage sensor reveals the molecular perturbations caused by a de novo mutation in a case of epilepsy. KEY POINTS: KV1.2 channels, encoded by the KCNA2 gene, regulate neuronal excitability by conducting K+ upon depolarization. A new KCNA2 missense variant was discovered in a patient with epilepsy, causing amino acid substitution F302L at helix S4, in the KV1.2 voltage-sensing domain. Immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry showed that F302L does not impair KCNA2 subunit surface trafficking. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that F302L alters the exposure of S4 residues to membrane lipids. Voltage clamp fluorometry revealed that the voltage-sensing domain of KV1.2-F302L channels is more sensitive to depolarization. Accordingly, KV1.2-F302L channels opened faster and at more negative potentials;\nKv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels in developmental perspective. Kv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels consist of two types of \u03b1-subunits: (a) electrically-active Kcnb1 \u03b1-subunits and (b) silent or modulatory \u03b1-subunits plus \u03b2-subunits that, similar to silent \u03b1-subunits, also regulate electrically-active subunits. Voltage-gated potassium channels were traditionally viewed, mainly by electrophysiologists, as regulators of the electrical activity of the plasma membrane in excitable cells, a role that is performed by transmembrane protein domains of \u03b1-subunits that form the electric pore. Genetic studies revealed a role for this region of \u03b1-subunits of voltage-gated potassium channels in human neurodevelopmental disorders, such as epileptic encephalopathy. The N- and C-terminal domains of \u03b1-subunits interact to form the cytoplasmic subunit of heterotetrameric potassium channels that regulate electric pores. Subsequent animal studies revealed the developmental functions of Kcnb1-containing voltage-gated potassium channels and illustrated their role during brain development and reproduction. These functions of potassium channels are discussed in this review\nE236K channels correlates with the mild end of the clinical spectrum reported in patients with GoF/LoF defects. The response to 4-AP corroborates existing evidence that KCNA2-disorders could benefit from variant-tailored therapeutic approaches, based on functional studies. An epilepsy-associated KV1.2 charge-transfer-center mutation impairs KV1.2 and KV1.4 trafficking. We report on a heterozygous KCNA2 variant in a child with epilepsy. KCNA2 encodes KV1.2 subunits, which form homotetrameric potassium channels and participate in heterotetrameric channel complexes with other KV1-family subunits, regulating neuronal excitability. The mutation causes substitution F233S at the KV1.2 charge transfer center of the voltage-sensing domain. Immunocytochemical trafficking assays showed that KV1.2(F233S) subunits are trafficking deficient and reduce the surface expression of wild-type KV1.2 and KV1.4: a dominant-negative phenotype extending beyond KCNA2, likely profoundly perturbing electrical signaling. Yet some KV1.2(F233S) trafficking was rescued by wild-type KV1.2 and KV1.4 subunits, likely in permissible heterotetrameric stoichiometries: electrophysiological studies utilizing applied transcriptomics and concatemer",

A related biological role of PIP(2) may be to control the activity of ion transporters and channels during biosynthesis or vesicle trafficking. Low PIP(2) concentrations in the secretory pathway would inactivate all of the systems that are stimulated by PIP(2). How, in detail, is PIP(2) used by cells to control ion channel and transporter activities? Further progress requires an improved understanding of lipid kinases and phosphatases, how they are regulated, where they are localized in cells, and with which ion channels and transporters they might localize.

Potassium (K+) is a vital cation and is involved in multiple physiological functions in plants. K+ uptake from outer medium by roots is a tightly regulated process and is\ncalcium release channels (RyR). Systems reported to be inhibited by PIP(2) include (i) cyclic nucleotide-gated channels of the rod (CNG), (ii) transient receptor potential-like (TRPL) Drosophila phototransduction channels, (iii) capsaicin-activated transient receptor potential (TRP) channels (VR1), and (iv) IP(3)-gated calcium release channels (IP3R).

Presumably, local changes of the concentration of PIP(2) in the plasma membrane represent cell signals to those mechanisms sensitive to PIP(2) changes. Unfortunately, our understanding of how local PIP(2) concentrations are regulated remains very limited. One important complexity is the probable existence of phospholipid microdomains, or lipid rafts. Such domains may serve to localize PIP(2) and thereby PIP(2) signaling, as well as to organize PIP(2) binding partners into signaling complexes. A related\nIonotropic and metabotropic kainate receptor signalling regulates Cl- homeostasis and GABAergic inhibition. KEY POINTS: Potassium-chloride co-transporter 2 (KCC2) plays a critical role in regulating chloride homeostasis, which is essential for hyperpolarizing inhibition in the mature nervous system. KCC2 interacts with many proteins involved in excitatory neurotransmission, including the GluK2 subunit of the kainate receptor (KAR). We show that activation of KARs hyperpolarizes the reversal potential for GABA (EGABA ) via both ionotropic and metabotropic signalling mechanisms. KCC2 is required for the metabotropic KAR-mediated regulation of EGABA , although ionotropic KAR signalling can hyperpolarize EGABA independent of KCC2 transporter function. The KAR-mediated hyperpolarization of EGABA is absent in the GluK1/2-/- mouse and is independent of zinc release from mossy fibre terminals. The ability of KARs to regulate KCC2 function may have implications in diseases with disrupted excitation: inhibition balance, such as epilepsy, neuropathic pain, autism spectrum disorders and Down's syndrome.ABSTRACT: Potassium-chloride\nimplications in diseases with disrupted excitation: inhibition balance, such as epilepsy, neuropathic pain, autism spectrum disorders and Down's syndrome.ABSTRACT: Potassium-chloride co-transporter 2 (KCC2) plays a critical role in the regulation of chloride (Cl- ) homeostasis within mature neurons. KCC2 is a secondarily active transporter that extrudes Cl- from the neuron, which maintains a low intracellular Cl- concentration [Cl- ]. This results in a hyperpolarized reversal potential of GABA (EGABA ), which is required for fast synaptic inhibition in the mature central nervous system. KCC2 also plays a structural role in dendritic spines and at excitatory synapses, and interacts with 'excitatory' proteins, including the GluK2 subunit of kainate receptors (KARs). KARs are glutamate receptors that display both ionotropic and metabotropic signalling. We show that activating KARs in the hippocampus hyperpolarizes EGABA , thus strengthening inhibition. This hyperpolarization occurs via both ionotropic and metabotropic KAR signalling in the CA3 region, whereas it\nglutamate transporters (DAT and GLT-1, respectively) share some biophysical characteristics, as both are secondary active carriers coupled to electrochemical ion gradients. In order to identify common or specific components of their respective proteomes, we performed a proximity labelling assay (BioID) in the hippocampal cell line HT22. While most of the identified proteins were specific for each transporter (and will be analyzed elsewhere), we detected two membrane proteins in the shared interactome of GLT-1 and DAT: the transmembrane protein 263 (Tmem263) and the potassium channel protein Kv7.3. However, only Kv7.3 formed immunoprecipitable complexes with GLT-1 and DAT in lysates of transfected HEK293 cells. Moreover, either DAT or GLT-1 co-clustered with Kv7.2/7.3 along the axonal tracts in co-transfected primary neurons, indicating a close spatial proximity between these proteins. Kv7.3, forming heterotetramers with the closely related subunit Kv7.2, underlies the M-currents that control the resting membrane potential and spiking activity in neurons. To\nthe closely related subunit Kv7.2, underlies the M-currents that control the resting membrane potential and spiking activity in neurons. To investigate whether the presence of the potassium channel affected DAT or GLT-1 function, we performed uptake determinations using radioactive substrate and electrophysiological measurements. Uptake through both transporters was mildly stimulated by the presence of the channel, an effect that was reversed by the potassium channel blocker XE-991. Electrophysiological recording (in transfected HT22 and differentiated SH-SY5Y cells) indicated that the depolarizing effect induced by the presence of the neurotransmitter was reverted by the activity of the potassium channel. Altogether, these data suggest a tight spatial and functional relationship between the DAT/GLT-1 transporters and the Kv7.2/7.3 potassium channel that immediately readjusts the membrane potential of the neuron, probably to limit the neurotransmitter-mediated neuronal depolarization.

Mutations in the THGP encoding gene result in Familial Juvenile Hyperuricemic Nephropathy (FJHN), Medullary Cystic Kidney Disease type 2 (MCKD-2), and Glomerulocystic Kidney Disease (GCKD). The physicochemical and biological properties of THGP have been studied extensively, but its physiological function in the TAL remains obscure. We performed yeast two-hybrid screening employing a human kidney cDNA library and identified THGP as a potential interaction partner of the renal outer medullary potassium channel (ROMK2), a key player in the process of salt reabsorption along the TAL. Functional analysis by electrophysiological techniques in Xenopus oocytes showed a strong\n, thus strengthening inhibition. This hyperpolarization occurs via both ionotropic and metabotropic KAR signalling in the CA3 region, whereas it is absent in the GluK1/2-/- mouse, and is independent of zinc release from mossy fibre terminals. The metabotropic signalling mechanism is dependent on KCC2, although the ionotropic signalling mechanism produces a hyperpolarization of EGABA even in the absence of KCC2 transporter function. These results demonstrate a novel functional interaction between a glutamate receptor and KCC2, a transporter critical for maintaining inhibition, suggesting that the KAR:KCC2 complex may play an important role in excitatory:inhibitory balance in the hippocampus. Additionally, the ability of KARs to regulate chloride homeostasis independently of KCC2 suggests that KAR signalling can regulate inhibition via multiple mechanisms. Activation of kainate-type glutamate receptors could serve as an important mechanism for increasing the strength of inhibition during periods of strong glutamatergic activity. The complex and intriguing lives of PIP2 with\nserine/threonine kinases with unique catalytic domains that lack the lysine residue used in other kinases to co-ordinate ATP (hence, With No K [WNK]). Their closest homologues are found within the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway suggesting a role in signalling. Two WNK isoforms, WNK1 and WNK4, have been identified as the disease genes for a rare monogenic hypertension syndrome (Gordon's syndrome or pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 [PHA2]) implicating them in salt homeostasis by the kidney. This is supported by recent data showing widespread expression of WNK1 and WNK4 in mammalian transporting epithelia. Within the kidney, WNKs probably regulate the surface expression of several proteins involved in ion transport, including the sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCCT) and the potassium channel renal outer medullary potassium channel (ROMK), based on co-expression studies in Xenopus oocytes. WNKs, especially WNK4, have been suggested as candidate genes for essential hypertension itself, but evidence for this is lacking. Some of\nin the process of salt reabsorption along the TAL. Functional analysis by electrophysiological techniques in Xenopus oocytes showed a strong increase in ROMK current amplitudes when co-expressed with THGP. The effect of THGP was specific for ROMK2 and did not influence current amplitudes upon co-expression with Kir2.x, inward rectifier potassium channels related to ROMK. Single channel conductance and open probability of ROMK2 were not altered by co-expression of THGP, which instead increased surface expression of ROMK2 as determined by patch clamp analysis and luminometric surface quantification, respectively. Despite preserved interaction with ROMK2, disease-causing THGP mutants failed to increase its current amplitude and surface expression. THGP(-/-) mice exhibited increased ROMK accumulation in intracellular vesicular compartments when compared with WT animals. Therefore, THGP modulation of ROMK function confers a new role of THGP on renal ion transport and may contribute to salt wasting observed in FJHN/MCKD-2/GCKD patients.\nespecially WNK4, have been suggested as candidate genes for essential hypertension itself, but evidence for this is lacking. Some of the effects of the WNKs are independent of their kinase function, suggesting that they are dependent on specific protein-protein interactions. It seems likely that the WNKs are part of much larger protein scaffolds in cells and have effects in cells beyond ion transport. However, because of their effect on expression of the NCCT they are attractive drug targets for the development of novel antihypertensive agents. These agents could potentially offer the efficacy of a thiazide diuretic, but without the metabolic side effects usually seen with this class of antihypertensive therapy. Identification of potassium channel proteins Kv7.2/7.3 as common partners of the dopamine and glutamate transporters DAT and GLT-1. Dopamine and glutamate transporters (DAT and GLT-1, respectively) share some biophysical characteristics, as both are secondary active carriers coupled to electrochemical ion\noocytes. CPK3CA inhibited only channel conductance but had no effect on channel open probability. Further, CPK3 in vivo interacted with AKT1. Under low K+ conditions, cpk3 knock-out mutants had no distinct phenotype, while the seedlings of 35S-CPK3CA overexpressing lines died even at normal K+ concentration. Further, the transgenic lines expressing CPK3CA under AKT1 promoter (ProAKT1-CPK3CA) exhibited the same phenotype as akt1 mutant with a defective root growth and leaf chlorosis. Moreover, ProAKT1-CPK3CA transgenic lines had lower root and shoot K+ contents than Col. Overall, the data reported here demonstrate that the expression of constitutively active of CPK3 impairs potassium uptake and transports in Arabidopsis under low K+ stress by inhibiting the activity of AKT1. WNK kinases and the control of blood pressure. The WNK kinases are a small group of serine/threonine kinases with unique catalytic domains that lack the lysine residue used in other kinases to co-ordinate ATP (hence, With\nin multiple physiological functions in plants. K+ uptake from outer medium by roots is a tightly regulated process and is mainly carried out by two high affinity K+ transport proteins AKT1 and HAK5. It has been shown that calcium (Ca2+) signaling plays important roles in the regulation of K+ transport in plants. Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) are involved in regulation of multiple K+ channels in different tissues. However, it remains to be studied whether CPKs are involved in the regulation of AKT1 and, thereby, K+ transport. Here, we have shown that constitutively active version of CPK3 (CPK3CA) is involved in K+ transport in Arabidopsis via regulating AKT1 under low K+ conditions. The constitutively active version of CPK3 (CPK3CA), as well as CPK21 (CPK21CA), inhibited K+ currents of AKT1 in Xenopus oocytes. CPK3CA inhibited only channel conductance but had no effect on channel open probability. Further, CPK3 in vivo interacted with",

Our findings support that dysfunctional axonal trafficking and reduced GBR expression in Alzheimer's disease increases A\u03b2 formation. Pianp deficiency links GABAB receptor signaling and hippocampal and cerebellar neuronal cell composition to autism-like behavior Pianp (also known as Leda-1) is a type I transmembrane protein with preferential expression in the mammalian CNS. Its processing is characterized by proteolytic cleavage by a range of proteases including Adam10, Adam17, MMPs, and the \u03b3-secretase complex. Pianp can interact with Pilr\u03b1 and the GB1a subunit of the GABAB receptor (GBR) complex. A recent case description of a boy with global developmental delay and homozygous nonsense variant in PIANP supports the hypothesis that PIANP is involved in the control of behavioral traits in mammals. To investigate the physiological functions of Pianp, constitutive, global knockout mice were generated and comprehensively analyzed. Broad assessment did not indicate malformation or malfunction\nless well studied. Although most strongly expressed in the brain, Pianp was initially identified in rat liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Similar to Ajap1, Pianp also sorts to the basolateral domain of the plasma membrane and alters E-cadherin processing in polarized epithelial cells. Pianp itself also undergoes posttranslational proteolytic processing by Furin-like pro-protein convertases, Matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs) as well as Adam10 or Adam17, and the \u03b3-secretase complex. In addition, Pianp was shown to be expressed in lymphoid organs and bone marrow-derived macrophages of BALB/c mice. In line with this, Pianp was identified as a ligand of immune inhibitory receptor Pilr\u03b1 in vitro and it has been shown that glycosylation of Pianp is necessary for this interaction. Pianp and Pilr\u03b1 are counter regulated upon LPS stimulation of murine macrophages and MMPs are responsible for LPS-mediated downregulation of Pianp in these cells.

Although deficiency of the main subunits of GBRs in mice did not reveal autism-like behaviors, there is evidence that GABAergic signaling is functionally impaired in ASD despite normal GABA receptor availability. Such impairment may be mediated by modifications of GABA receptor interactions with associated proteins. In order to comprehensively analyze the physiological functions of Pianp in vivo, we generated Pianp-deficient (PianpKO) mice. PianpKO mice show neuroanatomical alterations including reduced thickness of the granule cell layer in the dentate gyrus (DG) and reduced numbers of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. These alterations were accompanied by a significant deficit in presynaptic GBR-mediated inhibition of glutamate release, increased neuronal apoptosis, altered gene expression including reduced expression of ASD candidate gene Erdr1 and autism-like behavior including\nvivo. Although GBRs have not been reported to be directly involved in ASD, several reports show that activation of GBRs by GBR agonist baclofen may improve ASD symptoms. In the BTRB and C58 mouse models of autism, baclofen improves social deficits and repetitive behavior. In constitutive NMDAR hypofunction, baclofen rescues behavioral deficits, and in 16p11.2 deletion mice, baclofen reverses cognitive deficits and improves social interactions. These findings indicate that constitutive hypoactivation of GBRs may context-dependently contribute to the manifestation of autism-like behavioral traits. As Purkinje cells are recognized as key cells mediating autism-like phenotypes in mice and Purkinje cells represent the neuronal cell type with the highest levels of GBRs as well as high expression of Pianp, it appears reasonable that Pianp deficiency associated cerebellar alterations and Purkinje cell dysfunction contribute to autism-like behavior. Overall, the behavioral phenotype of PianpKO mice including context dependent enhanced anxiety, learning deficits, altered stress\ngene involved in autism-like behavior, cerebellar and hippocampal pathology, and GBR signaling. Introduction Ajap1 and Pianp (initially described as Leda-1) constitute a family of type I transmembrane proteins preferentially expressed in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). Ajap1, contained in chromosomal region 1p36, was found to be frequently deleted in neuroblastoma and oligodendroglioma and thus represents a tumor suppressor gene in these tumors. Notably, Isidor et al. described a child with a complex constitutional subtelomeric 1p36.3 deletion/duplication that has intellectual disability (ID) and neonatal neuroblastoma indicating that Ajap1 may have important functions in the brain beyond tumor suppression. In addition, Ajap1 was identified as a new susceptibility locus for migraine and as a novel candidate gene for the treatment response to risperidone in schizophrenia. In contrast to Ajap1, Pianp is less well studied. Although most strongly expressed in the brain, Pianp was initially identified in rat liver sinusoidal endothelial cells.\nautistic-like behavior in a mouse model of tuberous sclerosis complex Dysfunctional cerebellar Purkinje cells contribute to autism-like behaviour in Shank2-deficient mice A gene expression signature in developing Purkinje cells predicts autism and intellectual disability co-morbidity status Modular composition and dynamics of native GABAB receptors identified by high-resolution proteomics Complex formation of APP with GABAB receptors links axonal trafficking to amyloidogenic processing Organization and functions of mGlu and GABAB receptor complexes Role of GABA(B) receptors in learning and memory and neurological disorders Excitatory/inhibitory balance and circuit homeostasis in autism spectrum disorders Deficits in the activity of presynaptic \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type B receptors contribute to altered neuronal excitability in fragile X syndrome Differential association of GABAB receptors with their effector ion channels in Purkinje cells Regulation of neuronal GABA(B) receptor functions by subunit composition GABAA receptor availability is not altered in adults with autism spectrum disorder or in mouse models Immobility in\ngyrus (DG), entorhinal cortex (Ent), lateral hypothalamus (LH), piriform cortex (Pir), and ventral subiculum (VS). Pianp expression (in red) was observed with a neuronal expression pattern in most brain regions of control but not PianpKO mice. c In the cortex layer I (1), which is mostly composed of astrocytes, only minor Pianp expression (in red) was detected by ISH in control mice, while the deeper layers II to VI of the cortex (2), which are mostly composed of neuronal cells, displayed strong Pianp expression. d Pianp expression (in red) was detected by ISH in control mice in hippocampal pyramidal neurons (1) but not in fiber tracts (2) of the hippocampus, in which predominantly glia cells occur. e In the cerebellum of control mice Pianp expression (in red) was predominantly observed in Purkinje cells by ISH. f The thickness of the primary somatosensory cortex did not significantly differ (p > 0.05)\n= 3.03, p < 0.01) in comparison to control mice (n = 13). The total distance moved, however, did not differ significantly between the two groups (t(26) = 0.19, p > 0.05). Horizontal lines indicate mean \u00b1 SEM. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, two-tailed unpaired or paired t-test The open field test (OFT) assesses general exploratory behavior as well as general motor functions. In the open field the total distance moved by PianpKO mice did not significantly differ from the control mice, neither at the habituation day (day 1) nor at the following day (day 2). Comparison of the two experimental days, however, revealed a difference in the distribution of the exploratory drive. PianpKO mice showed a bigger reduction in the distance moved in the first 5 min between day 1 (habituation day) and day 2 (test day) in comparison to control mice. This difference was\n9A, B). As this difference could not be detected at the subsequent days, a motoric deficit seemed unlikely. In the startle and prepulse inhibition (PPI) test, a lower PPI was detected in PianpKO mice (Supplementary Fig. 9C). Post hoc analysis, however, revealed PPI deficits in PianpKO mice only at the prepulse levels 76 dB and 80 dB. Exploratory and anxiety-like behavior in Pianp-deficient mice Pianp-deficient mice show increased anxiety in novel and aversive settings. a The total distance moved in the open field test (OFT) was not significantly different between control (n = 11) and PianpKO mice (n = 15) at day 1 (t(24) = 0.07, p > 0.05) or day 2 (t(24) = 0.14, p > 0.05). However, a higher distance moved in the first 5 min at day 1 compared with day 2 was detected in PianpKO (t(14) = 5.15, p > 0.001) as well as in control\ncut coronally using a cryostat (Leica Biosystems, Nussloch, Germany) and manually microdissected using brain punches. Paxinos\u2019 and Franklin\u2019s the Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates was used for identification of the different brain areas. Western blotting Dissected brain region tissue was lysed using RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously. Images were acquired with the Odyssey CLx imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) and quantified using ImageJ 1.48i. Primary antibodies: anti-Pianp (clone 9C7), anti-beta-Actin (No. A2103, Sigma-Aldrich). Secondary antibodies coupled with IRDye680RD and IRDye800CW (LI-COR). In situ hybridization (ISH) ISH was conducted on coronal sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) brains using RNAscope 2.5 HD and BaseScope assays in red (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA, USA). The following probes were used for hybridization: BaseScope probe BA-Mm-Pianp-2EJ (No. 705741) and RNAscope probe Mm-Erdr1 (No. 465101). Thickness of layers, adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and Purkinje\nfunctions of Pianp, constitutive, global knockout mice were generated and comprehensively analyzed. Broad assessment did not indicate malformation or malfunction of internal organs. In the brain, however, decreased sizes and altered cellular compositions of the dentate gyrus as well as the cerebellum, including a lower number of cerebellar Purkinje cells, were identified. Functionally, loss of Pianp led to impaired presynaptic GBR-mediated inhibition of glutamate release and altered gene expression in the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus including downregulation of Erdr1, a gene linked to autism-like behavior. Behavioral phenotyping revealed that Pianp deficiency leads to context-dependent enhanced anxiety and spatial learning deficits, an altered stress response, severely impaired social interaction, and enhanced repetitive behavior, which all represent characteristic features of an autism spectrum disorder-like phenotype. Altogether, Pianp represents a novel candidate gene involved in autism-like behavior, cerebellar and hippocampal pathology, and GBR signaling. Introduction Ajap1 and Pianp (initially described as Leda-1)\nappears to be a key region affected by autism and Purkinje cells, GABAergic neurons located in the cerebellar cortex, have been shown to be reduced in number and density in ASD. The role of Purkinje cells has also been underscored by the description of autism-like neuroanatomic alterations and behaviors in mice with Purkinje cell-specific deficiency of either Tsc1, Tsc2, or Shank2. Although there is no uniform classification for endophenotypes of ASD, it was recently proposed that an ASD-associated gene cluster expressed in Purkinje cells correlated with ID-free ASD in comparison to an ASD-associated gene cluster expressed in the neocortex, which was related to ID-associated ASD. Recently, it was shown that Pianp, Ajap1, and App form three distinct GABAB receptor (GBR) complexes by binding to the N-terminal sushi-domain of GB1a, a subunit of presynaptic GBRs. While App is necessary for axonal GBR expression, Ajap1 and Pianp are not required for axonal\nas social partner mouse 1 (SP1), while the controls (n = 12), showed a significantly higher exploration time at SP1 than at the EC (t(12) = 4.08, p < 0.01). Therefore control mice had a statistically significant preference for SP1 (t(12) = 5.63, p < 0.001) that was not present in PianpKO mice (t(14) = 1.07, p > 0.05). Subsequent exposure to the familiar SP1 and to another unknown mouse, designated as social partner mouse 2 (SP2), PianpKO mice (t(14) = 2.38, p < 0.05) and controls (t(12) = 2.71, p < 0.05) both showed a slight, but statistically significant, preference for unknown SP2. However, the exploration times at SP1 and SP2 did only differ statistically significant in the control group (control: t(12) = 2.28, p < 0.05; PianpKO: t(14) = 1.58, p > 0.05). b In the odor discrimination test, PianpKO mice (n = 13) did not show a\n= 1.58, p > 0.05). b In the odor discrimination test, PianpKO mice (n = 13) did not show a significant difference in the time spent sniffing the nonsocial odors oil (O2: t(23) = 1.49, p > 0.05; O3: t(23) = 0.69, p > 0.05), apart from the first round (O1: t(23) = 2.75, p < 0.05,), orange (Or1: t(23) = 1.18, p > 0.05; Or2: t(23) = 0.37, p > 0.05; Or3: t(23) = 1.68, p > 0.05), and vanilla (V1: t(23) = 1.16, p > 0.05; V2: t(23) = 1.38, p > 0.05; V3: t(23) = 0.91, p > 0.05) in comparison to the controls (n = 12). However, PianpKO mice spent a significantly shorter time sniffing female urine (FU1: t(23) = 4.59, p < 0.001; FU3: t(23) = 2.15, p < 0.05) compared with the controls (n = 12). However, FU2 did not differ significantly (FU2: t(23)",

In contrast to native-like controls, GluClcryst exhibits classical activation by its neurotransmitter ligand L-glutamate. The modified channel is also sensitive to allosteric modulators associated with human GABAA receptors, and to site-directed mutations predicted to alter channel opening. Opposite Effects of the S4-S5 Linker and PIP(2) on Voltage-Gated Channel Function: KCNQ1/KCNE1 and Other Channels. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels are tetramers, each subunit presenting six transmembrane segments (S1-S6), with each S1-S4 segments forming a voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and the four S5-S6 forming both the conduction pathway and its gate. S4 segments control the opening of the intracellular activation gate in response to changes in membrane potential.

Several mechanisms have been proposed to describe the coupling at a molecular scale. This review summarizes the mechanisms suggested for various voltage-gated ion channels, including a mechanism that we described for KCNQ1, in which S4S5(L) is acting like a ligand binding to S6(T) to stabilize the channel in a closed state. As discussed in this review, this mechanism may explain the reverse response to depolarization in HCN-like channels. As opposed to S4S5(L), the phosphoinositide, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)), stabilizes KCNQ1 channel in an open state. Many other ion channels (not only voltage-gated) require PIP(2) to function properly, confirming its crucial importance as an ion channel cofactor. This is highlighted in cases\nthe single membrane-spanning segment of DPPX-S and the channel's VSD in the transmembrane core. The typical operating membrane potential range of the neuronal Kv4 channel may depend on this exceptional interaction. Supplemental Material A CLCN1 mutation in dominant myotonia congenita impairs the increment of chloride conductance during repetitive depolarization. Myotonia congenita is caused by mutation of the CLCN1 gene, which encodes the human skeletal muscle chloride channel (ClC-1). The ClC-1 protein is a dimer comprised of two identical subunits each incorporating its own separate pore. However, the precise pathophysiological mechanism underlying the abnormal ClC-1 channel gating in some mutants is not fully understood. We characterized a ClC-1 mutation, Pro-480-Thr (P480T) identified in dominant myotonia congenita, by using whole-cell recording. P480T ClC-1 revealed significantly slowed activation kinetics and a slight depolarizing shift in the voltage-dependence of the channel gating. Wild-type/mutant heterodimers exhibited similar kinetic properties and voltage-dependency to mutant homodimers. Simulating\nparameter, indicating precise positioning of this portion of the KCNE proteins within the channel complex. An intermediate phenotype produced by several smaller aliphatic-substituted mutants yields conditional voltage independence that is distinct from the voltage-dependent gating process, suggesting that KCNE3 traps the channel in a stable open state. From these results, we propose a model of KCNE-potassium channel interaction where the functional consequence depends on the precise contact at a single amino acid. A Dipeptidyl Aminopeptidase\u2013like Protein Remodels Gating Charge Dynamics in Kv4.2 Channels Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase\u2013like proteins (DPLPs) interact with Kv4 channels and thereby induce a profound remodeling of activation and inactivation gating. DPLPs are constitutive components of the neuronal Kv4 channel complex, and recent observations have suggested the critical functional role of the single transmembrane segment of these proteins (Zagha, E., A.

In sharp contrast, DPPX-S had no effect on gating charge movements of the Shaker B Kv channel. We propose that DPPX-S destabilizes resting and intermediate states in the voltage-dependent activation pathway, which promotes the outward gating charge movement. The remodeling of gating charge dynamics may involve specific protein\u2013protein interactions of the DPPX-S's transmembrane segment with the voltage-sensing and pore domains of the Kv4.2 channel. This mechanism may determine the characteristic fast operation of neuronal Kv4 channels in the subthreshold range of membrane potentials. INTRODUCTION Auxiliary \u03b2 subunits of Kv channels influence gating through diverse mechanisms, which in the best known instances involve direct interactions with intracellular domains of the channel. Interactions with transmembrane core domains (pore domain [PD] and voltage-sensing domain [VSD]) are also plausible and may help to explain the promiscuous effects of certain Kv channel \u03b2 subunits (e.g., MiRP) on Kv channel permeation and gating. The dipeptidyl\nFunctional characterization of neurotransmitter activation and modulation in a nematode model ligand-gated ion channel. The superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels includes neurotransmitter receptors that mediate fast synaptic transmission in vertebrates, and are targets for drugs including alcohols, anesthetics, benzodiazepines, and anticonvulsants. However, the mechanisms of ion channel opening, gating, and modulation in these receptors leave many open questions, despite their pharmacological importance. Subtle conformational changes in both the extracellular and transmembrane domains are likely to influence channel opening, but have been difficult to characterize given the limited structural data available for human membrane proteins. Recent crystal structures of a modified Caenorhabditis elegans glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) in multiple states offer an appealing model system for structure-function studies. However, the pharmacology of the crystallographic GluCl construct is not well established. To establish the functional relevance of this system, we used two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology in Xenopus oocytes to characterize activation of\nemerged from recent studies that identified putative interactions between the sole transmembrane segment of the DPLPs and discrete components of the Kv4 VSD. Therefore, we hypothesized that the DPLP transmembrane segment may remodel the gating charge displacements that control Kv4 channel activation gating through interactions with the S4 voltage sensor. Such interactions may reshape the energetic landscape of the channel's voltage sensor during gating. To test the hypothesis and gain more direct insights into the mechanisms of DPLP action, it is necessary to measure the Kv4 gating current (Ig). Under voltage-clamp conditions and in the absence of ion conduction, the gating charge displacements in the Kv channel protein generate the nonlinear ON and OFF capacitive transients of the Ig, which correspond to the apparent outward and inward movements of the VSDs, respectively. To block ion conduction and thereby unveil the Kv4.2 Ig for the first time, we engineered a charybdotoxin\ntemporal and spatial heterogeneity of subunit composition, complicating both modeling of their functional impact on the ventricular action potential and design of specific current-targeted compounds. Here, we discuss current thinking and lines of experimentation aimed at resolving the complexities of the Kv channel complexes that repolarize the human ventricular myocardium. A single transmembrane site in the KCNE-encoded proteins controls the specificity of KvLQT1 channel gating. KCNEs are a family of genes encoding small integral membrane proteins whose role in governing voltage-gated potassium channel gating is emerging. Whether each member of this homologous family interacts with channel proteins in the same manner is unknown; however, it is clear that the functional effect of each KCNE on channel gating is different. The specificity of KCNE1 (minK) and KCNE3 control of activation of the potassium channel KvLQT1 maps to a triplet of amino acids within the KCNE transmembrane domain by chimera analysis. We\nvoltage-gated) require PIP(2) to function properly, confirming its crucial importance as an ion channel cofactor. This is highlighted in cases in which an altered regulation of ion channels by PIP(2) leads to channelopathies, as observed for KCNQ1. This review summarizes the state of the art on the two regulatory mechanisms that are critical for KCNQ1 and other voltage-gated channels function (PIP(2) and S4S5(L)), and assesses their potential physiological and pathophysiological roles. Impact of ancillary subunits on ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels generate the outward K(+) ion currents that constitute the primary force in ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium channels comprise tetramers of pore-forming alpha subunits and, in probably most cases in vivo, ancillary or beta subunits that help define the properties of the Kv current generated. Ancillary subunits can be broadly categorized as cytoplasmic or transmembrane and can modify Kv channel trafficking, conductance, gating, ion selectivity, regulation, and pharmacology. Because\ndata symbols are the best-fit fourth-order Boltzmann functions with the following parameters: V 1/2 (closed symbols) = \u221245 mV and k (closed symbols) = 5.4 mV; and V 1/2 (open symbols) = \u221270 mV and k (open symbols) = 5.5 mV. V 1/2 is the calculated voltage at Gp/Gpmax = 0.5, and k is the slope factor. The \u0394V 1/2 = \u221225 mV. The Ig from the Shaker B Kv Channel Is Not Affected by DPPX-S DPPX-S is a membrane protein with a single transmembrane segment that could interact promiscuously with the VSD in the transmembrane core of other Kv channels and thereby alter their biophysical properties. To test this possibility, we investigated the effect of DPPX-S on the Ig of the Shaker B channel. The Ig from nonconducting Shaker B channels (W434F mutant) and Shaker B channels exposed to CTX or in the absence of permeant ions exhibits similar\nthe potassium channel KvLQT1 maps to a triplet of amino acids within the KCNE transmembrane domain by chimera analysis. We now define the structural determinants of functional specificity within this triplet. The central amino acid of the triplet (Thr-58 of minK and Val-72 of KCNE3) is essential for the specific control of voltage-dependent channel activation characteristics of both minK and KCNE3. Using site-directed mutations that substitute minK and KCNE3 residues, we determined that a hydroxylated central amino acid is necessary for the slow sigmoidal activation produced by minK. The precise spacing of the hydroxyl group was required for minK-like activation. An aliphatic amino acid substituted at position 58 of minK is capable of reproducing KCNE3-like kinetics and voltage-independent constitutive current activation. The bulk of the central residue is another critical parameter, indicating precise positioning of this portion of the KCNE proteins within the channel complex. An intermediate phenotype produced by\nnot support another recent study, which reported effects of DPPY on Kv1.4 ionic current kinetics. Thus, the dramatic remodeling of Kv4.2CTX gating charge dynamics by DPPX-S is relatively specific. DISCUSSION In vivo, most Kv channels exist as part of macromolecular complexes that include a variety of specific \u03b2 subunits. Although there is considerable information on the mechanisms responsible for the biophysical effects of \u03b2 subunits that interact with intracellular channel domains (T1 or the C-terminal region), much less is known about those that may interact with the transmembrane domains of the channel's core (PD and VSD). The Kv channel VSD has been the subject of intense research and controversy, and major breakthroughs have been made toward solving the mechanisms of voltage-dependent activation. Nevertheless, the possible remodeling of the Kv channel VSD by specific membrane-spanning \u03b2 subunits that affect voltage-dependent gating remained largely unexplored. Therefore, we investigated the interactions between DPPX-S\nshift in the voltage-dependence of the channel gating. Wild-type/mutant heterodimers exhibited similar kinetic properties and voltage-dependency to mutant homodimers. Simulating myotonic discharge with the voltage clamp protocol of a 50 Hz train pulse, the increment of chloride conductance was impaired in both wild-type/mutant heterodimers and mutant homodimers, clearly indicating a dominant-negative effect. Our data showed that slow activation gating of P480T ClC-1 impaired the increment of chloride conductance during repetitive depolarization, thereby accentuating the chloride conductance reduction caused by a slight depolarizing shift in the voltage-dependence of the channel gating. This pathophysiology may explain the clinical features of myotonia congenita.\nexplain the promiscuous effects of certain Kv channel \u03b2 subunits (e.g., MiRP) on Kv channel permeation and gating. The dipeptidyl aminopeptidase\u2013like proteins (DPLPs), a recently discovered family of \u03b2 subunits of neuronal Kv4 channels, may also use the latter type of interactions to influence function. DPLPs are analogous to the CD26 surface antigen, but lack enzymatic activity, and consist of a variable intracellular N-terminal domain followed by a single membrane-spanning segment and a large extracellular C-terminal domain. DPLPs shift the voltage-dependent properties of Kv4 channels and accelerate their inactivation gating kinetics. Relative to the Kv4 \u03b1 subunits expressed alone, Kv4\u2013DPLP complexes exhibit a substantially leftward-shifted conductance-voltage relationship, which may result from remodeling different aspects of activation and inactivation gating. More concretely, however, a possible explanation for the leftward-shifted voltage dependence emerged from recent studies that identified putative interactions between the sole transmembrane segment of the DPLPs and discrete components of\nbroadly categorized as cytoplasmic or transmembrane and can modify Kv channel trafficking, conductance, gating, ion selectivity, regulation, and pharmacology. Because of their often profound effects on Kv channel function, studies of the molecular correlates of ventricular repolarization must take into account ancillary subunits as well as alpha subunits. Cytoplasmic ancillary subunits include the Kv beta subunits, which regulate a range of Kv channels and may link channel gating to redox potential, and the KChIPs, which appear most often associated with Kv4 subfamily channels that generate the ventricular I(to) current. Transmembrane ancillary subunits include the MinK-related proteins (MiRPs) encoded by KCNE genes, which modulate members of most Kv alpha subunit subfamilies, and the putative 12-transmembrane domain KCR1 protein, which modulates hERG. In some cases, such as the ventricular I(Ks) channel complex, it is well established that the KCNQ1 alpha subunit must coassemble with the MinK (KCNE1) single-transmembrane domain ancillary subunit for\nB channels (W434F mutant) and Shaker B channels exposed to CTX or in the absence of permeant ions exhibits similar properties. Therefore, we expressed the Shaker B W434F mutant alone or coexpressed it with DPPX-S in tsA201 cells and studied the Ig. This Ig is typically >1 nA at positive membrane potentials and exhibits the characteristic biophysical properties that fully agree with previous studies (Fig. S1, available at http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200609668/DC1). In sharp contrast with the results obtained with the Kv4.2CTX channel, however, DPPX-S had no significant effects on the kinetics of the Ig or the voltage dependence of the gating charge (Fig. S1 and Table I). At the protein level, this result is consistent with the absence of a physical interaction between Kv1.4, a Shaker-type channel, and DPPY, but it does not support another recent study, which reported effects of DPPY on Kv1.4 ionic current kinetics. Thus, the dramatic remodeling of\nTo establish the functional relevance of this system, we used two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology in Xenopus oocytes to characterize activation of crystallographic and native-like GluCl constructs by L-glutamate and ivermectin. We also tested modulation by ethanol and other anesthetic agents, and used site-directed mutagenesis to explore the role of a region of Loop F which was implicated in ligand gating by molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings indicate that the crystallographic construct functionally models concentration-dependent agonism and allosteric modulation of pharmacologically relevant receptors. Specific substitutions at residue Leu174 in loop F altered direct L-glutamate activation, consistent with computational evidence for this region's role in ligand binding. These insights demonstrate conservation of activation and modulation properties in this receptor family, and establish a framework for GluCl as a model system, including new possibilities for drug discovery. In this study, we elucidate the validity of a modified glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluClcryst ) as a\ninteractions may involve specific contacts between the transmembrane segment of DPPX-S, the VSD, and the PD. Further biochemical and structural studies are necessary to understand the stoichiometry and architecture of such a Kv channel complex, the identity of the unique interactions, and the physical basis of the functional remodeling. The presence of the DPPX-S transmembrane segments as part of the Kv4 channel complex may reconfigure the architecture of the VSD in an important way. Neurophysiological Implications of Remodeling Kv4.2 Gating Charge Dynamics by DPPX-S Various studies suggest strongly that DPLPs are integral parts of the native Kv4 channel complex that underlies the somatodendritic A-type K+ current (ISA) in the mammalian brain. Critical functions of ISA include the regulation of repetitive firing frequency, dampening of backpropagating action potentials, and compartmentalization of dendritic excitability. These functional roles depend on the ability of ISA to operate in the subthreshold range of membrane potentials.\nE., A. Ozaita, S.Y. Chang, M.S. Nadal, U. Lin, M.J. Saganich, T. McCormack, K.O. Akinsanya, S.Y. Qi, and B. Rudy. 2005. J. Biol. Chem. 280:18853\u201318861). However, the underlying mechanism of action is unknown. We hypothesized that a unique interaction between the Kv4.2 channel and a DPLP found in brain (DPPX-S) may remodel the channel's voltage-sensing domain. To test this hypothesis, we implemented a robust experimental system to measure Kv4.2 gating currents and study gating charge dynamics in the absence and presence of DPPX-S. The results demonstrated that coexpression of Kv4.2 and DPPX-S causes a \u221226 mV parallel shift in the gating charge-voltage (Q-V) relationship. This shift is associated with faster outward movements of the gating charge over a broad range of relevant membrane potentials and accelerated gating charge return upon repolarization. In sharp contrast, DPPX-S had no effect on gating charge movements of the Shaker B Kv channel. We propose\nrepresented by a closed circle and a horizontal line in the box, respectively. Error bars represent the 5th and 95th percentiles, respectively. The fractional amplitudes of the exponential terms are indicated by the numbers displayed below or above the corresponding boxes. DPPX-S Promotes Voltage-dependent Activation of Kv4.2 Channels The effects of DPPX-S on Kv4.2 gating charge dynamics could result from selective changes in the voltage-dependent transitions of the activation pathway. To test this hypothesis qualitatively, we simulated the Ig by assuming a general form of the Zagotta-Hoshi-Aldrich (ZHA) kinetic model without the final CF state. Currently, there is no specific kinetic model that explains all major features of Kv4.2 channel gating unambiguously. In the ZHA model, each subunit of the Kv channel tetramer acts independently and undergoes two sequential voltage-dependent transitions that correspond to the major movements of the voltage sensor. Assuming that DPPX-S induces a fivefold increase in the",

We addressed the requirement for stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+)-sensor, and Orai1, a Ca(2+) selective channel, in regulating Ca(2+) entry through the store-operated channels mouse transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) 4 or human TRPC1. Studies were made using murine and human lung endothelial cells (ECs) challenged with thrombin known to induce Ca(2+) entry via TRPC1/4. Deletion or knockdown of TRPC4 abolished Ca(2+) entry secondary to depletion\nstimulated Ca(2+) entry in a specific endothelial state during the transition from a proliferating to a quiescent phenotype. Thus, TRPC4 may adopt divergent, as yet unappreciated functions in endothelial Ca(2+) homeostasis and emerges as a potential key player in endothelial phenotype switching and tuning of cellular growth factor signaling. Regulation of endothelial cell barrier function by store-operated calcium entry. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels fulfill important and diverse signaling functions, and are generally conserved among species. The canonical subfamily of TRP proteins, TRPC channels, possesses 7 isoforms that combine in various ways to form heteromultimers. In endothelium, TRPC1 and TRPC4 form subunits of a channel that selectively conducts calcium. This channel is activated by calcium depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum, and thus TRPC1/TRPC4 forms the molecular basis of a store operated calcium entry pathway. TRPC4 interacts with protein 4.1, which tethers the channel to the membrane skeleton and represents a\ncomplexes together with TRPC4 and TRPC5. (iii) All other TRPCs exclusively assemble into homo- or heterotetramers within the confines of TRPC subfamilies--e.g., TRPC4/5 or TRPC3/6/7. The principles of TRPC channel formation offer the conceptual framework to assess the physiological role of distinct TRPC proteins in living cells. Canonical transient receptor potential channel 4 (TRPC4) co-localizes with the scaffolding protein ZO-1 in human fetal astrocytes in culture. Members of the mammalian transient receptor potential (TRP) family form cation-permeable channels at the plasma membrane implicated in capacitative calcium influx after activation by either second-messenger-mediated pathways or store depletion, or both. This study shows that with the use of RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry, resting astrocytes express TRPC4 at the cell membrane, particularly at sites of cell-to-cell contact. By confocal imaging and immunoelectron microscopy, we detected co-localization of TRPC4 with the scaffolding protein zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), and demonstrated that immunoprecipitation with antibodies\noperated calcium entry pathway. TRPC4 interacts with protein 4.1, which tethers the channel to the membrane skeleton and represents a gating mechanism required for calcium permeation. In response to inflammatory agonists such as thrombin and bradykinin, the generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate transiently depletes endoplasmic reticulum calcium and activates the TRPC1/TRPC4 channel. Calcium permeation through this channel triggers cytoskeletal reorganization that is necessary to disrupt the endothelial cell barrier and increase permeability. Thus, inhibition of the TRPC1/TRPC4 channel provides a putative anti-inflammatory strategy.\nthat observed with wild-type G\u03b1i2 (nearly 5%). G\u03b2\u03b3 and the TRPC4 channel showed a FRET efficiency lower than 6%. In HEK293 cells transfected with the M2 muscarinic receptor, the application of carbachol increased the FRET efficiency between TRPC4\u03b2-CFP and G\u03b1i2(WT)-YFP from 4.7 \u00b1 0.4% (n = 7) to 12.6 \u00b1 1.4% (n = 7). We also found that the TRPC4 channel directly interacts with G\u03b1i2, but not with G\u03b1q, when the channel is open. We analyzed the calcium levels in HEK293 cells expressing the channels and G\u03b1i2 or G\u03b1q using the calcium indicator YC6.1 (Yellow Cameleon 6.1). In response to the muscarinic agonist carbachol, M2-, G\u03b1i2-, and TRPC4-expressing cells showed a prolonged Ca(2+) influx compared with cells expressing only M2. Together, these data suggest that G\u03b1i2 activates the TRPC4 channel by direct binding, which then induces Ca(2+) entry. TRUSS, TNF-R1, and TRPC ion channels synergistically reverse endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ storage\ninsights into the mechanisms that connect TNF-R1 to GPCR-induced Ca(2+) signaling. Isoform- and receptor-specific channel property of canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC)1/4 channels. Transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) 1, the first mammalian homologue of Drosophila trp gene, is distributed widely in mammalian cells and is involved in many physiological functions. TRPC1 is reported to be functional following heteromeric formation with other TRPC channels such as TRPC4 or TRPC5. It is known that the composition of this widely distributed TRPC1 is far from simple; functionality of such channels has been highly controversial. Furthermore, TRPC1 gene is known to have two splicing variants; one encodes long (TRPC1\u03b1) and the other encodes short (TRPC1\u03b2) TRPC1 isoforms, respectively. In this study, we examined the functionality of TRPC1/4 channels using various activation systems. Gq/11-coupled receptor (e.g., M1 or M3 receptors) stimulation significantly increased TRPC1\u03b1/4 currents but induced mild activation of TRPC1\u03b2/4. In addition, when expressed\n(e.g., M1 or M3 receptors) stimulation significantly increased TRPC1\u03b1/4 currents but induced mild activation of TRPC1\u03b2/4. In addition, when expressed with TRPC4, TRPC1\u03b1 acted as a pore-constituting subunit and not a \u03b2 ancillary subunit. Multimerized with TRPC4, TRPC1\u03b1 also generated strong pore field strength. We also found that Gi/o-coupled receptor (e.g., M2 receptor) stimulation was insufficient to activate TRPC1\u03b1/4 and TRPC1\u03b2/4 channels but selectively activated TRPC4 homomeric channels. These findings demonstrate that TRPC1/4 channel shows dynamic gating property depending on TRPC1 isoform subtypes and receptor stimulation system. Therefore, careful discrimination of the specificity of TRPC1 isoforms and upstream activation system is important in thorough understanding of TRPC1 and TRPC1/4 channels. Interaction between TRPC channel subunits in endothelial cells. Transient Receptor Potential Canonical (TRPC) proteins have been identified in mammals as a family of plasma membrane calcium-permeable channels activated by different kinds of stimuli in several cell types. We have studied\nexpression system and in native endothelial cells. Specifically, an extracellularly hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged TRPC4 mutant, which is sensitive to blockage by anti-HA-antibody, was found to transfer anti-HA sensitivity to both TRPC3-related currents in the HEK293 expression system and the redox-sensitive cation conductance of PAECs. We propose TRPC3 and TRPC4 as subunits of native endothelial cation channels that are governed by the cellular redox state. Orai1 determines calcium selectivity of an endogenous TRPC heterotetramer channel. RATIONALE: Canonical transient receptor potential 4 (TRPC4) contributes to the molecular composition of a channel encoding for a calcium selective store-operated current, I(SOC), whereas Orai1 critically comprises a channel encoding for the highly selective calcium release activated calcium current, I(CRAC). However, Orai1 may interact with TRPC proteins and influence their activation and permeation characteristics. Endothelium expresses both TRPC4 and Orai1, and it remains unclear as to whether Orai1 interacts with TRPC4 and contributes to calcium permeation through\nby direct binding, which then induces Ca(2+) entry. TRUSS, TNF-R1, and TRPC ion channels synergistically reverse endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ storage reduction in response to m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor signaling. Although most signaling responses initiated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) occur in a Ca(2+)-independent fashion, TNF-alpha receptor signaling augments Ca(2+) entry induced by Galpha(q/11) G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in endothelial cells and increases trans-endothelial permeability. The signaling events involved in GPCR-induced Ca(2+) influx have been characterized and involve store-operated Ca(2+) entry facilitated by the Ca(2+) permeable ion channel, transient receptor potential canonical 4 (TRPC4). Little is known about the mechanisms by which TNF-alpha receptor signaling augments GPCR-induced Ca(2+) entry. TNF-alpha Receptor Ubiquitous Signaling and Scaffolding protein (TRUSS) is a tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNF-R1)-associated protein whose gene name is TRPC4-associated protein (TRPC4AP). The goal of our study was to test the hypothesis that TRUSS serves to link TNF-R1 and GPCR-signaling pathways\nTRPC4 and Orai1, and it remains unclear as to whether Orai1 interacts with TRPC4 and contributes to calcium permeation through the TPRC4 channel.OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that Orai1 interacts with TRPC4 and contributes to the channel's selective calcium permeation important for endothelial barrier function.METHODS AND RESULTS: A novel method to purify the endogenous TRPC4 channel and probe for functional interactions was developed, using TRPC4 binding to protein 4.1 as bait. Isolated channel complexes were conjugated to anti-TRPC protein antibodies labeled with cy3-cy5 pairs. F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer among labeled subunits revealed the endogenous protein alignment. One TRPC1 and at least 2 TRPC4 subunits constituted the endogenous channel (TRPC1/4). Orai1 interacted with TRPC4. Conditional Orai1 knockdown reduced the probability for TRPC1/4 channel activation and converted it from a calcium-selective to a nonselective channel, an effect that was rescued on Orai1 reexpression. Loss of Orai1 improved endothelial cell barrier function.CONCLUSION: Orai1\nbetween the TRPC4 and the catalytic site of the tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates TRPC4 at Tyr-959 and facilitates channel insertion into the plasma membrane.CONCLUSION: We provide evidence for the association of a TRPC4 SNP with MI in population-based genetic studies. The higher Ca(2+) signals generated by TRPC4-I957V may ultimately facilitate the generation of endothelium- and nitric oxide-dependent vasorelaxation, thereby explaining its protective effect at the vasculature. TRPC4 and TRPC5: receptor-operated Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channels. The seven mammalian channels from the classical (TRPC) subfamily of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are thought to be receptor-operated cation channels activated in a phospholipase C (PLC)-dependent manner. Based on sequence similarity, TRPC channels can be divided into four subgroups. Group 4 comprises TRPC4 and TRPC5, and is most closely related to group 1 (TRPC1). The functional properties observed following heterologous expression of TRPC4 or TRPC5 in mammalian cells are contradictory and, therefore, controversial. In\nliving cells. Hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors give rise to calcium entry via receptor-activated cation channels that are activated downstream of phospholipase C activity. Members of the transient receptor potential channel (TRPC) family have been characterized as molecular substrates mediating receptor-activated cation influx. TRPC channels are assumed to be composed of multiple TRPC proteins. However, the cellular principles governing the assembly of TRPC proteins into homo- or heteromeric ion channels still remain elusive. By pursuing four independent experimental approaches--i.e., subcellular cotrafficking of TRPC subunits, differential functional suppression by dominant-negative subunits, fluorescence resonance energy transfer between labeled TRPC subunits, and coimmunoprecipitation--we investigate the combinatorial rules of TRPC assembly. Our data show that (i) TRPC2 does not interact with any known TRPC protein and (ii) TRPC1 has the ability to form channel complexes together with TRPC4 and TRPC5. (iii) All other TRPCs exclusively assemble into homo- or heterotetramers within the confines of\nTRPC4 in the glomeruli of mouse renal sections. The results of RT-PCR performed to distinguish between TRPC4-alpha and TRPC4-beta were consistent with expression of both isoforms in brain but with only TRPC4-alpha expression in MMC. These studies show that TRPC4-alpha may form the homotetrameric SOC in mouse mesangial cells. Identification of two domains involved in the assembly of transient receptor potential canonical channels. Transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels are associated with calcium entry activity in nonexcitable cells. TRPCs can form homo- or heterotetrameric channels, in which case they can assemble together within a subfamily groups. TRPC1, 4, and 5 represent one group, and TRPC3, 6, and 7 represent the other. The molecular determinants involved in promoting subunit tetramerization are not known. To identify them, we generated chimeras by swapping the different domains of TRPC4 with the same regions in TRPC6. We showed that TRPC4 coimmunoprecipitated with the chimeras containing\nin the mid 90ies to be under the control of caveolin, the structural protein of caveolae. Nowadays, a large body of evidence has confirmed that the caveolin/eNOS interaction was needed to prevent inadequate NO production under basal conditions but also to facilitate the integration of extracellular stimuli to intracellular NO signals. Compartmentation of key actors in the EDHF signaling pathway is now also proposed to take place into caveolae. Accordingly, caveolin-deficient animals revealed both an unopposed NO production promoting vessel dilation and a lack of EDHF-driven vasorelaxation. The transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are the link between caveolae and EDHF. Different TRP channels involved in the capacitative calcium entry were found to directly interact with caveolin-1 in endothelial cells. TRPC1 and TRPC4 form a complex with the endoplasmic reticulum IP3 receptor thereby optimizing calcium signaling. EDHF-driven vasodilation was documented to be altered in a TRPV4-deficient mouse model. The close vicinity\nClose spatio-association of the transient receptor potential canonical 4 (TRPC4) channel with G\u03b1i in TRPC4 activation process. TPRC channels are Ca(2+)-permeable, nonselective cation channels that are activated by a wide variety of stimuli, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). TRPC4 is commonly assumed to be activated by Gq/phospholipase C-coupled receptors. However, the other molecular mechanisms by which G\u03b1 proteins regulate TRPC4 remain unclear. Here, we found that G\u03b1i2 regulates TRPC4 activation by direct binding. To investigate this mechanism, we used whole patch clamp and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). We tagged an isoform of mTRPC4 and G protein with CFP and YFP, respectively, and transiently transfected cells with the FRET pair. The FRET efficiency between TRPC4\u03b2-CFP and the constitutively active mutant form of G\u03b1i2 was nearly 15% and was greater than that observed with wild-type G\u03b1i2 (nearly 5%). G\u03b2\u03b3 and the TRPC4 channel showed a FRET efficiency lower than 6%. In\nserum, stimulation with bFGF). Moreover, the data show that TRPC subunits are not tyrosine-phosphorylated after bFGF stimulation and they do not co-immunoprecipitate with the type 1 FGF receptor. These results suggest that BAE-1 cells are a suitable model to study function and regulation of endogenous TRPC1/TRPC4 heteromers. TRPC3 and TRPC4 associate to form a redox-sensitive cation channel. Evidence for expression of native TRPC3-TRPC4 heteromeric channels in endothelial cells. Canonical transient receptor potential proteins (TRPC) have been proposed to form homo- or heteromeric cation channels in a variety of tissues, including the vascular endothelium. Assembly of TRPC multimers is incompletely understood. In particular, heteromeric assembly of distantly related TRPC isoforms is still a controversial issue. Because we have previously suggested TRPC proteins as the basis of the redox-activated cation conductance of porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs), we set out to analyze the TRPC subunit composition of endogenous endothelial TRPC channels and\nfluorescent membrane puncta in WT but not in TRPC4(-/-) cells, indicating that mobilization of STIM1 and engagement of its Ca(2+) sensing function required TRPC4 expression. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed coupling of TRPC1 and TRPC4 with STIM1 on depletion of ER Ca(2+) stores. Thus, TRPC1 and TRPC4 can interact with STIM1 to form functional store-operated Ca(2+)-entry channels, which are essential for mediating Ca(2+) entry-dependent disruption of the endothelial barrier. TRPC4 forms store-operated Ca2+ channels in mouse mesangial cells. Studies were performed to identify the molecular component responsible for store-operated Ca(2+) entry in murine mesangial cells (MMC). Because the canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) family of proteins was previously shown to comprise Ca(2+)-selective and -nonselective cation channels in a variety of cells, we screened TRPC1-TRPC7 with the use of molecular methods and the fura 2 method to determine their participation as components of the mesangial store-operated Ca(2+) (SOC) channel. Using TRPC-specific primers and\nmicromolar range that lacks activity on most voltage-gated channels and other TRPs except TRPC5 and TRPC3. Lanthanides are specific activators of heterologously expressed TRPC4- and TRPC5-containing channels but can block individual native TRPC4-containing channels. The biological relevance of TRPC4-containing channels was demonstrated by knockdown of TRPC4 expression in numerous native systems including gene expression, cell differentiation and proliferation, formation of myotubes, and axonal regeneration. Studies of TRPC4 single and TRPC compound knockout mice uncovered their role for the regulation of vascular tone, endothelial permeability, gastrointestinal contractility and motility, neurotransmitter release, and social exploratory behavior as well as for excitotoxicity and epileptogenesis. Recently, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the Trpc4 gene was associated with a reduced risk for experience of myocardial infarction. Subunit composition of mammalian transient receptor potential channels in living cells. Hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors give rise to calcium entry via receptor-activated cation channels that are activated downstream\nporcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs), we set out to analyze the TRPC subunit composition of endogenous endothelial TRPC channels and report here on a redox-sensitive TRPC3-TRPC4 channel complex. The ability of TRPC3 and TRPC4 proteins to associate and to form a cation-conducting pore complex was supported by four lines of evidence as follows: 1) Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in PAECs and in HEK293 cells demonstrated the association of TRPC3 and TRPC4 in the same complex. 2) Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis demonstrated TRPC3-TRPC4 association, involving close proximity between the N terminus of TRPC4 and the C terminus of TRPC3 subunits. 3) Co-expression of TRPC3 and TRPC4 in HEK293 cells generated a channel that displayed distinct biophysical and regulatory properties. 4) Expression of dominant-negative TRPC4 proteins suppressed TRPC3-related channel activity in the HEK293 expression system and in native endothelial cells. Specifically, an extracellularly hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged TRPC4 mutant, which is sensitive to blockage by\n(TRPC4AP). The goal of our study was to test the hypothesis that TRUSS serves to link TNF-R1 and GPCR-signaling pathways at the level of TRPC4 by: (i) determining if TRUSS and TNF-R1 interact with TRPC4, and (ii) investigating the role of TRUSS, TNF-R1, and TRPC4 in GPCR-induced Ca(2+) signaling. Here, we show that TRUSS and TNF-R1 interact with a sub-family of TRPC channels (TRPC1, 4, and 5). In addition, we show that TRUSS and TNF-R1 function together with TRPC4 to elevate endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) filling in the context of reduced endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) storage initiated by G-protein coupled m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (m1AchR) signaling. Together, these findings suggest that TNF-R1, TRUSS, and TRPC4 augment Ca(2+) loading of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores in the context of m1AchR stimulation and provide new insights into the mechanisms that connect TNF-R1 to GPCR-induced Ca(2+) signaling.

Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNA encoding mKir4.2 displayed a large inwardly rectifying K+ current, while control oocytes injected with H2O displayed no similar K+ current. The current was blocked by Ba2+ and Cs+ in a voltage-dependent fashion and displayed inward rectification that was intermediate between that of the strong inward rectifier Kir2.1 and the weak inward rectifier Kir1.1.

Tamoxifen inhibits inward rectifier K+ 2.x family of inward rectifier channels by interfering with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-channel interactions. Tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor antagonist used in the treatment of breast cancer, inhibits the inward rectifier potassium current (I(K1)) in cardiac myocytes by an unknown mechanism. We characterized the inhibitory effects of tamoxifen on Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3 potassium channels that underlie cardiac I(K1). We also studied the effects of 4-hydroxytamoxifen and raloxifene. All three drugs inhibited inward rectifier K(+) 2.x (Kir2.x) family members. The order of inhibition for all three drugs was Kir2.3 > Kir2.1 approximately Kir2.2. The onset of inhibition of Kir2.x current by these compounds was slow (T(1/2) approximately 6 min) and only partially recovered after washout ( approximately 30%). Kir2.x\nguinea pig cardiomyocytes. (vi) Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed interaction between the N- and C-terminal intracellular domains of different Kir2.x subunits. Coexpression of Kir2.1 mutants related to Andersen's syndrome with wild-type Kir2.x channels showed a dominant negative effect, the extent of which varied between different mutants. Our results suggest that differential tetramerization of the mutant allele of Kir2.1 with wild-type Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3 channels represents the molecular basis of the extraordinary pleiotropy of Andersen's syndrome. Expression of a functional Kir4 family inward rectifier K+ channel from a gene cloned from mouse liver. 1. A low stringency polymerase chain reaction (PCR) homology screening procedure was used to probe a mouse liver cDNA library to identify novel inward rectifier K+ channel genes. A single gene (mLV1) was identified that exhibited extensive sequence homology with previously cloned inward rectifier K+ channel genes. The mLV1 gene showed greatest sequence identity with genes belonging to\ncytoplasmic domain of inward rectifier potassium channels. Inward rectifier potassium (Kir) channels act as cellular diodes, allowing unrestricted flow of potassium (K(+)) into the cell while preventing currents of large magnitude in the outward direction. The rectification mechanism by which this occurs involves a coupling between K(+) and intracellular blockers-magnesium (Mg(2+)) or polyamines-that simultaneously occupy the permeation pathway. In addition to the transmembrane pore, Kirs possess a large cytoplasmic domain (CD) that provides a favorable electronegative environment for cations. Electrophysiological experiments have shown that the CD is a key regulator of both conductance and rectification. In this study, we calculate and compare averaged equilibrium probability densities of K(+) and Cl(-) in open-pore models of the CDs of a weak (Kir1.1-ROMK) and a strong (Kir2.1-IRK) rectifier through explicit-solvent molecular-dynamics simulations in ~1 M KCl. The CD of both channels concentrates K(+) ions greater than threefold inside the cytoplasmic pore while IRK\nfunction. Intracellular domain associations resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of the GIRK1 N and C termini and GIRK4 N and C termini. The point mutation I331R in the GIRK1 C terminus or L337R in the GIRK4 C terminus decreased the association between the N and C termini. Mutation of a GIRK1 N-terminal hydrophobic residue, predicted structurally to interact with the C-terminal domain, also resulted in a decrease in channel function and termini association. We hypothesize that the hydrophobic nature of this GIRK1 subunit region is critical for interaction between adjacent termini and is permissive for channel gating. In addition, the homologous mutation in cytoplasmic domains of Kir2.1 (L330R) did not disrupt association, suggesting that the overall structural integrity of this region is critical for inward rectifier function. Multi-ion distributions in the cytoplasmic domain of inward rectifier potassium channels. Inward rectifier potassium (Kir) channels act as cellular diodes, allowing unrestricted flow of\nMutation of critical GIRK subunit residues disrupts N- and C-termini association and channel function. The subfamily of G-protein-linked inwardly rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs) is coupled to G-protein receptors throughout the CNS and in the heart. We used mutational analysis to address the role of a specific hydrophobic region of the GIRK1 subunit. Deletion of the GIRK1 C-terminal residues 330-384, as well as the point mutation I331R, resulted in a decrease in channel function when coexpressed with GIRK4 in oocytes and in COS-7 cells. Surface protein expression of GIRK1 I331R coexpressed with GIRK4 was comparable with wild type, indicating that subunits assemble and are correctly localized to the membrane. Subsequent mutation of homologous residues in both the GIRK4 subunit and Kir2.1 (Gbetagamma-independent inward rectifier) also resulted in a decrease in channel function. Intracellular domain associations resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of the GIRK1 N and C termini and GIRK4 N and C\nepithelial and brain glial cells. uKATP-1 and BIR form with sulfonylurea receptors, the so-called ATP-sensitive K+ channels. Thus, it is a feature of the Kir channel family that each subfamily plays a specific physiological functional role. The (Na+)-activated Kir channels identified electrophysiologically in neurons and cardiac myocytes have not yet been cloned. In this review, we overviewed the current understandings of the features of the molecular structures and functions of the four main subfamilies of Kir channels. Heteromerization of Kir2.x potassium channels contributes to the phenotype of Andersen's syndrome. Andersen's syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder related to mutations of the potassium channel Kir2.1, is characterized by cardiac arrhythmias, periodic paralysis, and dysmorphic bone structure. The aim of our study was to find out whether heteromerization of Kir2.1 channels with wild-type Kir2.2 and Kir2.3 channels contributes to the phenotype of Andersen's syndrome. The following results show that Kir2.x channels can form\nKir channels constitute a new family of K+ channels whose subunits contain two putative transmembrane domains and a pore-forming region. So far, more than ten cDNAs of Kir channel subunits have been isolated and classified into four subfamilies: 1) IRK subfamily (IRK1-3/Kir1.1-1.3), 2) GIRK subfamily (GIRK1-4/Kir3.1-3.4), 3) ATP-dependent Kir subfamily (ROMK1/Kir1.1, K(AB)-2/Kir4.1), and 4) ATP-sensitive Kir subfamily (uKATP-1/Kir6.1, BIR/Kir6.2). Xenopus oocytes injected with the cRNAs of IRKs elicit classical Kir channel currents. GIRKs, as heteromultimers, compose the G protein-gated Kir (KG) channels, which are regulated by a variety of Gi/Go-coupled inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors such as m2-mus-carinic, serotonergic (5HT1A), GABAB, somatostatin and opioid (mu, delta, kappa) receptors. ROMK1 and KAB-2 are characterized with a Walker type-A ATP-binding motif in their carboxyl termini, and may be involved in K+ transport in renal epithelial and brain glial cells. uKATP-1 and BIR form with sulfonylurea receptors, the so-called ATP-sensitive K+ channels. Thus, it is\nKir2.2 and Kir2.3 channels contributes to the phenotype of Andersen's syndrome. The following results show that Kir2.x channels can form functional heteromers: (i) HEK293 cells transfected with Kir2.x-Kir2.y concatemers expressed inwardly rectifying K(+) channels with a conductance of 28-30 pS. (ii) Expression of Kir2.x-Kir2.y concatemers in Xenopus oocytes produced inwardly rectifying, Ba(2+) sensitive currents. (iii) When Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 channels were coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes the IC(50) for Ba(2+) block of the inward rectifier current differed substantially from the value expected for independent expression of homomeric channels. (iv) Coexpression of nonfunctional Kir2.x constructs, in which the GYG region of the pore region was replaced by AAA, with wild-type Kir2.x channels produced both homomeric and heteromeric dominant-negative effects. (v) Kir2.1 and Kir2.3 channels could be coimmunoprecipitated in membrane extracts from isolated guinea pig cardiomyocytes. (vi) Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed interaction between the N- and C-terminal intracellular domains of different Kir2.x subunits.\ncurrent by these compounds was slow (T(1/2) approximately 6 min) and only partially recovered after washout ( approximately 30%). Kir2.x inhibition was concentration-dependent but voltage-independent. The time course and degree of inhibition was independent of external or internal drug application. We tested the hypothesis that tamoxifen interferes with the interaction between the channel and the membrane-delimited channel activator, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)). Inhibition of Kir2.3 currents was significantly reduced by a single point mutation of I213L, which enhances Kir2.3 interaction with membrane PIP(2). Pretreatment with PIP(2) significantly decreased the inhibition induced by tamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and raloxifene on Kir2.3 channels. Pretreatment with spermine (100 microM) decreased the inhibitory effect of tamoxifen on Kir2.1, probably by strengthening the channel's interaction with PIP(2). In cat atrial and ventricular myocytes, 3 microM tamoxifen inhibited I(K1), but the effect was greater in the former than the latter. The data strongly suggest that tamoxifen, its metabolite, and\na voltage-independent fashion. 3. mKir4.2 current was subject to modulation by several distinct mechanisms. Intracellular acidification decreased mKir4.2 current in a reversible fashion, while activation of protein kinase C decreased mKir4.2 current in a manner that was not rapidly reversible. Incubation of oocytes in elevated [K+] produced a slowly developing enhancement of current. 4. Oocytes co-injected with cRNA for mKir4.2 and Kir5.1, a protein that does not form functional homomeric channels, displayed membrane currents with properties distinct from those expressing mKir4.2 alone. Co-injected oocytes displayed larger currents than mKir4.2, with novel kinetic properties and an increased sensitivity to Ba2+ block at negative potentials, suggesting that mKir4.2 forms functional heteromultimeric channels with Kir5.1, as has been shown for Kir4.1 5. These results demonstrate for the first time that a Kir4.2 channel gene product forms functional channels in Xenopus oocytes, that these Kir channels display novel properties, and that Kir4.2 subunits may\n~1 M KCl. The CD of both channels concentrates K(+) ions greater than threefold inside the cytoplasmic pore while IRK shows an additional K(+) accumulation region near the cytoplasmic entrance. Simulations carried out with Mg(2+) or spermine (SPM(4+)) show that these ions interact with pore-lining residues, shielding the surface charge and reducing K(+) in both channels. The results also show that SPM(4+) behaves differently inside these two channels. Although SPM(4+) remains inside the CD of ROMK, it diffuses around the entire volume of the pore. In contrast, this polyatomic cation finds long-lived conformational states inside the IRK pore, interacting with residues E224, D259, and E299. The strong rectifier CD is also capable of sequestering an additional SPM(4+) at the cytoplasmic entrance near a cluster of negative residues D249, D274, E275, and D276. Although understanding the actual mechanism of rectification blockade will require high-resolution structural information of the blocked state, these\nbut the effect was greater in the former than the latter. The data strongly suggest that tamoxifen, its metabolite, and the estrogen receptor inhibitor raloxifene inhibit Kir2.x channels indirectly by interfering with the interaction between the channel and PIP(2).\nand D276. Although understanding the actual mechanism of rectification blockade will require high-resolution structural information of the blocked state, these simulations provide insight into how sequence variation in the CD can affect the multi-ion distributions that underlie the mechanisms of conduction, rectification affinity, and kinetics. Inwardly rectifying potassium channels: their molecular heterogeneity and function. A variety of cells including cardiac myocytes and neuronal cells possess inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) channels through which currents flow more readily in the inward direction than outward. These K+ channels play pivotal roles in maintenance of the resting membrane potential, in regulation of the action potential duration, in receptor-dependent inhibition of cellular excitability, and in the secretion and absorption of K+ ions across cell membrane. Recent molecular biological dissection has shown that the DNAs encoding Kir channels constitute a new family of K+ channels whose subunits contain two putative transmembrane domains and a pore-forming region.",

Therefore, an emerging paradigm for DGK is that the individual DGK isoforms assembled in their own signaling complexes should carry out spatio-temporally segregated tasks for a wide range of biological processes via regulating local, but not global, concentrations of DAG and/or PA. Unusual interplay of two types of Ras activators, RasGRP and SOS, establishes sensitive and robust Ras activation in lymphocytes. Ras activation is crucial for lymphocyte development and effector function. Both T and B lymphocytes contain two types of Ras activators: ubiquitously expressed SOS and specifically expressed Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (RasGRP). The need for two activators is enigmatic since both are activated following antigen receptor stimulation. In addition, RasGRP1 appears to be dominant over SOS in an unknown manner. The crystal structure of SOS\ncell line, this immature MC progenitor was used to address the function of RasGRP4 in MCs. HMC-1 leukemia cells differentiated and underwent granule maturation when induced to express a normal form of RasGRP4. Thus, RasGRP4 plays an important role in the final stages of MC development. Mast cells in airway hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ mice express a unique isoform of the signaling protein Ras guanine nucleotide releasing protein 4 that is unresponsive to diacylglycerol and phorbol esters. cDNAs were recently isolated from BALB/c mouse mast cells (MCs) that encode the new signaling protein mouse Ras guanine nucleotide releasing protein 4 (mRasGRP4). The present study evaluates the expression pattern and biological activity of mRasGRP4 in a variety of mouse strains. As assessed immunohistochemically and by RNA analysis, mRasGRP4 is not coordinately expressed with any of its family members. Normally, mRasGRP4 is an MC-restricted protein in tissues, and kinetic studies revealed that mRasGRP4 is\nemphasis on recent advances. Diacylglycerol kinase iota regulates Ras guanyl-releasing protein 3 and inhibits Rap1 signaling. To study the physiological function of diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase iota (DGKiota), which converts DAG to phosphatidic acid, we deleted this gene in mice. In contrast to previous studies showing that DGK isoforms decrease Ras activity, signaling downstream of Ras in embryonic fibroblasts was significantly reduced in cells lacking DGKiota. DGKs regulate Ras signaling by attenuating the function of the DAG-dependent Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing proteins (RasGRPs). We tested whether DGKiota inhibited the four known RasGRPs and found that it inhibited only RasGRP3. In addition to activating Ras, RasGRP3 also activates Rap1, which in some cases can antagonize the function of Ras. We demonstrate that DGKiota bound to RasGRP3 and inhibited its activation of Rap1 by metabolizing DAG. This inhibition consequently affected Ras signaling. We tested the physiological consequence of deleting DGKiota by crossing wild-type or\nmetabolizing DAG. This inhibition consequently affected Ras signaling. We tested the physiological consequence of deleting DGKiota by crossing wild-type or DGKiota-deficient mice with mice carrying a v-Ha-Ras transgene, and then we assessed tumor formation. We observed significantly fewer tumors in DGKiota-deficient mice. Because Rap1 can antagonize the function of Ras, our data are consistent with a model in which DGKiota regulates RasGRP3 with a predominant effect on Rap1 activity. Additionally, we found that DGKzeta, which is structurally similar to DGKiota, inhibited RasGRPs 1, 3, and 4 and predominantly affected Ras signaling. Thus, type IV DGKs regulate RasGRPs, but the downstream effects differ depending on the DGK. RasGRP4, a new mast cell-restricted Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing protein with calcium- and diacylglycerol-binding motifs. Identification of defective variants of this signaling protein in asthma, mastocytosis, and mast cell leukemia patients and demonstration of the importance of RasGRP4 in mast cell development and function. A\nDiacylglycerol kinases: why so many of them? Diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase (DGK) modulates the balance between the two signaling lipids, DAG and phosphatidic acid (PA), by phosphorylating DAG to yield PA. To date, ten mammalian DGK isozymes have been identified. In addition to the C1 domains (protein kinase C-like zinc finger structures) conserved commonly in all DGKs, these isoforms possess a variety of regulatory domains of known and/or predicted functions, such as a pair of EF-hand motifs, a pleckstrin homology domain, a sterile alpha motif domain and ankyrin repeats. Beyond our expectations, recent studies have revealed that DGK isozymes play pivotal roles in a wide variety of signal transduction pathways conducting development, neural and immune responses, cytoskeleton reorganization and carcinogenesis. Moreover, there has been rapidly growing evidence indicating that individual DGK isoforms exert their specific roles through interactions with unique partner proteins such as protein kinase Cs, Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein,\nfor the modulation of HVA Ca(2+) channels by G proteins, kinases, and the Ras-related RGK GTPases. New proteins have emerged in recent years that modulate HVA Ca(2+) channels by binding to Ca(v)\u03b2. There are also indications that Ca(v)\u03b2 may carry out Ca(2+) channel-independent functions, including directly regulating gene transcription. All four subtypes of Ca(v)\u03b2, encoded by different genes, have a modular organization, consisting of three variable regions, a conserved guanylate kinase (GK) domain, and a conserved Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain, placing them into the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein family. Crystal structures of Ca(v)\u03b2s reveal how they interact with Ca(v)\u03b1(1), open new research avenues, and prompt new inquiries. In this article, we review the structure and various biological functions of Ca(v)\u03b2, with both a historical perspective as well as an emphasis on recent advances. Diacylglycerol kinase iota regulates Ras guanyl-releasing protein 3 and inhibits Rap1 signaling. To study the physiological\nreceptor stimulation. In addition, RasGRP1 appears to be dominant over SOS in an unknown manner. The crystal structure of SOS provides a clue: an unusual allosteric Ras-GTP binding pocket. Here, we demonstrate that RasGRP orchestrates Ras signaling in two ways: (i) by activating Ras directly and (ii) by facilitating priming of SOS with RasGTP that binds the allosteric pocket. Priming enhances SOS' in vivo activity and creates a positive RasGTP-SOS feedback loop that functions as a rheostat for Ras activity. Without RasGRP1, initiation of this loop is impaired because SOS' catalyst is its own product (RasGTP)-hence the dominance of RasGRP1. Introduction of an active Ras-like molecule (RasV12C40) in T- and B-cell lines can substitute for RasGRP function and enhance SOS' activity via its allosteric pocket. The unusual RasGRP-SOS interplay results in sensitive and robust Ras activation that cannot be achieved with either activator alone. We hypothesize that this mechanism enables\non a region of chromosome 19q13.1 that had not been sequenced by the Human Genome Project. Human and mouse MCs and their progenitors selectively express RasGRP4, and this new intracellular protein contains all of the domains present in the RasGRP family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors even though it is <50% identical to its closest homolog. Recombinant RasGRP4 can activate H-Ras in a cation-dependent manner. Transfection experiments also suggest that RasGRP4 is a diacylglycerol/phorbol ester receptor. Transcript analysis of an asthma patient, a mastocytosis patient, and the HMC-1 cell line derived from a MC leukemia patient revealed the presence of substantial amounts of non-functional forms of hRasGRP4 due to an inability to remove intron 5 in the precursor transcript. Because only abnormal forms of hRasGRP4 were identified in the HMC-1 cell line, this immature MC progenitor was used to address the function of RasGRP4 in MCs. HMC-1 leukemia cells differentiated\nany of its family members. Normally, mRasGRP4 is an MC-restricted protein in tissues, and kinetic studies revealed that mRasGRP4 is expressed relatively early in developing MCs. The expression of mRasGRP4 in the fetus before granulated MCs become abundant supports the conclusion that RasGRP4 participates in MC-specific differentiation pathways. Functional studies conducted with recombinant material revealed that mRasGRP4 is a cation-dependent, diacylglycerol (DAG)-regulated, guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Immunoelectron microscopic studies revealed that mRasGRP4 resides in either the cytosol or inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of the MC, implying that DAG controls the intracellular movement of this signaling protein in c-kit-stimulated MCs. The mRasGRP4 gene resides on chromosome 7B1 within a site that is prominently linked to baseline airway reactivity in backcrossed C3H/HeJ and A/J mice. A truncated isoform of mRasGRP4 that lacks its DAG-regulatory domain was isolated from C3H/HeJ mouse MCs. Sequence analysis showed that this isoform is the result\nin sensitive and robust Ras activation that cannot be achieved with either activator alone. We hypothesize that this mechanism enables lymphocytes to maximally respond to physiologically low levels of stimulation. The \u00df subunit of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Calcium regulates a wide spectrum of physiological processes such as heartbeat, muscle contraction, neuronal communication, hormone release, cell division, and gene transcription. Major entryways for Ca(2+) in excitable cells are high-voltage activated (HVA) Ca(2+) channels. These are plasma membrane proteins composed of several subunits, including \u03b1(1), \u03b1(2)\u03b4, \u03b2, and \u03b3. Although the principal \u03b1(1) subunit (Ca(v)\u03b1(1)) contains the channel pore, gating machinery and most drug binding sites, the cytosolic auxiliary \u03b2 subunit (Ca(v)\u03b2) plays an essential role in regulating the surface expression and gating properties of HVA Ca(2+) channels. Ca(v)\u03b2 is also crucial for the modulation of HVA Ca(2+) channels by G proteins, kinases, and the Ras-related RGK GTPases. New proteins have emerged\nmastocytosis, and mast cell leukemia patients and demonstration of the importance of RasGRP4 in mast cell development and function. A cDNA was isolated from interleukin 3-developed, mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (MCs) that contained an insert (designated mRasGRP4) that had not been identified in any species at the gene, mRNA, or protein level. By using a homology-based cloning approach, the approximately 2.6-kb hRasGRP4 transcript was also isolated from the mononuclear progenitors residing in the peripheral blood of normal individuals. This transcript information was then used to locate the RasGRP4 gene in the mouse and human genomes, to deduce its exon/intron organization, and then to identify 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the human gene that result in 5 amino acid differences. The >15-kb hRasGRP4 gene consists of 18 exons and resides on a region of chromosome 19q13.1 that had not been sequenced by the Human Genome Project. Human and mouse MCs\nthat lacks its DAG-regulatory domain was isolated from C3H/HeJ mouse MCs. Sequence analysis showed that this isoform is the result of defective splicing of the precursor transcript. MCs play a central role in allergic inflammation. The discovery of a novel isoform of mRasGRP4 in hyporesponsive mice suggests that airway reactivity is influenced by RasGRP4-dependent signaling events in pulmonary MCs.",

        "desc": "these presequences are cleaved by specialized proteases, the mitochondrial presequence proteases. The major part of the presequence is cleaved by the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP). However, approximately one quarter of preproteins require a secondary processing that is carried out by the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase MIP/Oct1 or mitochondrial X-prolyl aminopeptidase 3 (XPNPEP3), also known as intermediate cleaving peptidase Icp55 in yeast and plants. MIP/Oct1 removes an additional octapeptide after MPP cleavage (Fig. 1), while XPNPEP3/Icp55 removes a single amino acid. All proteases involved in presequence cleavage are highly conserved from yeast to human, evidence of their fundamental role in mitochondrial biogenesis. MIPEP (MIM 602241, NM_005932) is comprised of 19 exons and maps to chromosome 13q12.12. MIP is expressed at high levels in heart, brain, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, all tissues that require a significant amount of energy and therefore are dependent on efficient mitochondrial ATP production. Furthermore, these tissues are often\ngenes. The mitochondrial defects upon lack of PreP result from the accumulation of presequence peptides that trigger feedback inhibition of MPP and accumulation of nonprocessed precursor proteins. Also, the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase MIP that cleaves eight residues from a subset of precursors after MPP processing is compromised upon loss of PreP suggesting that PreP also degrades MIP generated octapeptides. Investigation of the PrePR183Q patient mutation associated with neurological disorders revealed that the mutation destabilizes the protein making it susceptible to enhanced degradation and aggregation upon heat shock. Taken together, our data reveal a functional coupling between precursor processing by MPP and MIP and presequence degradation by PreP in human mitochondria that is crucial to maintain a functional organellar proteome.

Primer extension analysis has identified a major transcript of the MIPEP gene expressed differentially and predominantly in tissues with high oxygen consumption, while sequence analysis of approximately 2 kb of 5'-flanking DNA has revealed putative Mt1/3/4, NF-kappaB, and AP-1 elements that may regulate MIPEP expression in these tissues. Using a new polymorphic (CA)(n) repeat in intron 4, MIPEP has been genetically mapped within a 7-cM interval between markers D13S283 and D13S217 on 13q12. This work provides the basis for molecular analysis of MIPEP in FRDA and possibly other neurodegenerative diseases.

Experimental data in yeast support the pathogenicity of these variants and indicates that the mechanism of action is loss of function of MIP. The identification and description of the patients\u2019 genotype and phenotype together with functional biochemical analysis provide insights into the consequences of MIP dysfunction. Identification of this severe, early-onset condition expands the phenotypic spectrum associated with loss of mitochondrial presequence protease function to include cardiomyopathy and neurologic impairment.

Intermediate cleavage peptidase (Icp55) processes a subset of mitochondrial matrix proteins by removing a bulky residue at their N termini, leaving behind smaller N-terminal residues (icp activity). This contributes towards the stability of the mitochondrial proteome. We report crystal structures of yeast Icp55 including one bound to the apstatin inhibitor. Apart from icp activity, the enzyme was found to exhibit Xaa-Pro aminopeptidase activity in vitro. Structural and biochemical data suggest that the enzyme exists in a rapid equilibrium between\nfeatures shared by all four subjects included LVNC, developmental delay (DD), seizures, and hypotonia; three experienced infantile/early childhood death secondary to cardiomyopathy. Import of nuclear-encoded proteins into mitochondria and their processing. This process is guided by N-terminal presequences that direct import across the mitochondrial outer and inner membranes through translocons. Precursor processing by MPP and MIP/Oct1 removes the presequence and an additional octapeptide resulting in the mature, stable protein MIPEP encodes the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIP in human, Oct1 in yeast). A vast majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear DNA. These mitochondrial preproteins are then translated on cytosolic ribosomes and imported post-translationally. Approximately 70 % of these preproteins use N-terminal targeting signals (presequences) for import and translocation across the mitochondrial membranes. Upon entry into the mitochondrial matrix these presequences are cleaved by specialized proteases, the mitochondrial presequence proteases.

Functional analysis of the Oct1 L306F/L339F and K343E/K376E mutants revealed a severe decrease in Oct1 processing activity, as demonstrated by accumulation of processing intermediates. These processing intermediates included subunits of ETC complexes Sdh4 (succinate dehydrogenase, subunit of respiratory chain complex II and a novel Oct1 substrate), Rip1 (Rieske iron-sulfur-protein, subunit of respiratory chain complex III), Cox4 (cytochrome c oxidase, subunit 4 of respiratory chain complex IV), the citrate cycle enzyme Mdh1 (mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase), the ribosomal subunit Mrp21, the peroxiredoxin Prx1, and the mtHsp70 co-chaperone Mdj1 (also a novel Oct1 substrate) (Figs. 3 and 4), which showed strong accumulation in strains expressing the mutant versions of Oct1 (L339F and K376E). Since most of these proteins either directly or indirectly influence mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, it is highly likely that MIP/Oct1 defects affect mitochondrial bioenergetics. Therefore, defects in Oct1 activity might impact on respiratory chain\nMitochondrial intermediate peptidase and the yeast frataxin homolog together maintain mitochondrial iron homeostasis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a neurodegenerative disease typically caused by a deficiency of frataxin, a mitochondrial protein of unknown function. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, lack of the yeast frataxin homolog ( YFH1 gene, Yfh1p polypeptide) results in mitochondrial iron accumulation, suggesting that frataxin is required for mitochondrial iron homeostasis and that FRDA results from oxidative damage secondary to mitochondrial iron overload. This hypothesis implies that the effects of frataxin deficiency could be influenced by other proteins involved in mitochondrial iron usage. We show that Yfh1p interacts functionally with yeast mitochondrial intermediate peptidase ( OCT1 gene, YMIP polypeptide), a metalloprotease required for maturation of ferrochelatase and other iron-utilizing proteins. YMIP is activated by ferrous iron in vitro and loss of YMIP activity leads to mitochondrial iron depletion, suggesting that YMIP is part of a feedback loop\nputative protein partner of frataxin. We showed recently that the yeast mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (YMIP polypeptide; gene symbol, OCT1) promotes mitochondrial iron uptake by catalyzing the maturation of iron-utilizing proteins and exacerbates the mitochondrial iron accumulation that results from loss of yeast frataxin, a mitochondrial protein required for mitochondrial iron efflux. This suggests that the human MIP (HMIP polypeptide; gene symbol MIPEP) may be one of the loci predicted to influence the clinical manifestations of Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease caused by lack of human frataxin. To begin to test this hypothesis, we have characterized HMIP at the functional and genomic levels. We show that HMIP can complement a yeast knock-out mutant lacking YMIP, demonstrating that HMIP and YMIP are functional homologues. The MIPEP gene spans 57 kb and consists of 19 exons that correlate with the functional domains of HMIP. Primer extension analysis has identified a\nhad compound heterozygous SNVs (p.L582R/p.L71Q and p.E602*/p.L306F) and one patient from a consanguineous family had a homozygous SNV (p.K343E). The fourth patient, identified through the GeneMatcher tool, a part of the Matchmaker Exchange Project, was found to have inherited a paternal SNV (p.H512D) and a maternal CNV (1.4-Mb deletion of 13q12.12) that includes MIPEP. All amino acids affected in the patients\u2019 missense variants are highly conserved from yeast to human and therefore S. cerevisiae was employed for functional analysis (for p.L71Q, p.L306F, and p.K343E). The mutations p.L339F (human p.L306F) and p.K376E (human p.K343E) resulted in a severe decrease of Oct1 protease activity and accumulation of non-processed Oct1 substrates and consequently impaired viability under respiratory growth conditions. The p.L83Q (human p.L71Q) failed to localize to the mitochondria. Conclusions Our findings reveal for the first time the role of the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase in human disease. Loss of MIP function results in\nfor the first time the role of the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase in human disease. Loss of MIP function results in a syndrome which consists of LVNC, DD, seizures, hypotonia, and cataracts. Our approach highlights the power of data exchange and the importance of an interrelationship between clinical and research efforts for disease gene discovery.

Background Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is a heterogeneous disorder that may present with heart failure, arrhythmia, and systemic embolism. Failure to develop compact myocardium in the early embryo results in LVNC with the underlying genetic basis identified in around 30\u201350 % of individuals with LVNC. Different modes of inheritance have been described for LVNC, including autosomal dominant, X-linked, and mitochondrial inheritance. Among them, the most prevalent form is the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern (70 % of all\ncause nephronophthisis-like nephropathy 1 (NPHPL1). Mutations in the alpha subunit of MPP, encoded by PMPCA (MIM 213200), have been recently identified to cause an autosomal recessive form of non-progressive cerebellar ataxia. Copy number variations and SNVs have been reported to alter the inner mitochondrial membrane peptidase subunit 2 encoded by IMMP2L, causing neurodevelopmental disorders and age-associated neurodegeneration, respectively. Our identification of pathogenic variants in MIPEP in patients with LVNC and neurologic abnormalities illustrates the fundamental role of presequence proteases in mitochondrial protein processing and function and their contribution to human disease. Conclusions Our study reveals the first link between SNVs in the gene of the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase MIPEP and severe forms of LVNC. Phenotypic evaluation following the identification of biallelic MIPEP variants in four patients identified a shared and rare syndrome of LVNC, DD, seizures, hypotonia, cataracts, and infantile/early childhood death. Experimental data in yeast support the pathogenicity of\n% of all mitochondrial preproteins that are encoded in the nucleus and imported posttranslationally. The mitochondrial intermediate presequence protease MIP/Oct1, which carries out precursor processing, has not yet been established to have a role in human disease. Methods Whole exome sequencing was performed on four unrelated probands with left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC), developmental delay (DD), seizures, and severe hypotonia. Proposed pathogenic variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing or array comparative genomic hybridization. Functional analysis of the identified MIP variants was performed using the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the protein and its functions are highly conserved from yeast to human. Results Biallelic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) or copy number variants (CNVs) in MIPEP, which encodes MIP, were present in all four probands, three of whom had infantile/childhood death. Two patients had compound heterozygous SNVs (p.L582R/p.L71Q and p.E602*/p.L306F) and one patient from a consanguineous family had a homozygous SNV (p.K343E). The\ncerevisiae. a Immunoblot analysis of mitochondria isolated from oct1\u0394 yeast cells transformed with plasmids encoding wild-type Oct1 (Oct1 WT) or Oct1 mutants (L83Q, L339F, K376E) under the endogenous promoter or the empty control plasmid (e.v.). Cells were grown at 24 \u00b0C on a fermentable carbon source prior to organelle isolation. b Growth of yeast strains expressing Oct1WT or mutants Oct1L339F and Oct1K376E. Plasmid shuffling generated strains and growth behavior assessed on fermentative and respiratory carbon sources at low (23 \u00b0C) and high (37\u201338 \u00b0C) temperature. c Immunodecoration of mitochondria isolated from strains shown in b after cell growth for 10 h at 37 \u00b0C under respiratory conditions (non-fermentable carbon source). i processing intermediate, m mature protein, p precursor MIP and its yeast homologue Oct1 are highly conserved (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Therefore, we employed a yeast model system to assess the effects of the disease mutations on MIP in\nFigure S1). Therefore, we employed a yeast model system to assess the effects of the disease mutations on MIP in vivo. We introduced the Oct1 mutations by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed the wild type and disease mutants from a plasmid under the endogenous promoter in an OCT1 deletion strain. Mitochondria were isolated and analyzed for Oct1 processing defects by SDS-PAGE and immunodecoration (Fig. 3a). Re-expression of the wild-type Oct1 protein rescued the processing defect of the Oct1 substrates Mdh1 and Sdh4 (Fig. 3a, lanes 1 and 4) while yeast cells transformed with the empty vector (e.v.) as control showed complete accumulation of Oct1 processing intermediates (Fig. 3a, lanes 2 and 5). Mutation of Oct1 at position L83Q (MIP L71Q) also fully abolished Oct1 processing (Fig. 3a, lane 3). Immunodecoration using an antibody specific to Oct1 revealed that expression of the L83Q mutant does not result in detectable Oct1 protein levels\nof patient 4 was identified by array comparative genomic hybridization (Affymetrix CytoScan\u00ae HD) and encompasses 1.4 Mb at 13q12 (chr13: 23,519,916\u201324,941,516, hg19) (Fig. 2; Additional file 3: Figure S3). Clinical spectrum Retrospective clinical analyses delineated a consistent phenotype of cardiomyopathy, LVNC, seizures, and hypotonia/developmental delay in all subjects with infantile or early childhood death. Patient 1 was born full term by vaginal delivery after an uncomplicated pregnancy. By 5 months of age, he presented with failure to thrive. At 5.5 months of age, he was diagnosed with LVNC and ECG showed Wolf\u2013Parkinson\u2013White (WPW) syndrome. His family history is notable for a paternal uncle with a history of supra-ventricular tachycardia and maternal great-aunt with early myocardial infarction (29 years of age) but was otherwise unremarkable. His father\u2019s family is of Scottish/Mexican/Native American ancestry and mother\u2019s family is of Colombian/Native American ancestry. There is no known consanguinity. Physical examination revealed length, weight,\nan antibody specific to Oct1 revealed that expression of the L83Q mutant does not result in detectable Oct1 protein levels in mitochondria. Consequently, the L83Q mutant mimics an OCT1 deletion phenotype. Mutations of L339F (MIP L306F, Fig. 3a, lane 6) and K376E (MIP K343E, Fig. 3a, lane 7) showed increased accumulation of Oct1 processing intermediates for Mdh1 and Sdh4, indicating an impaired Oct1 proteolytic function in these mutants in vivo. In contrast, non-Oct1 substrates (controls) were not changed and the protein levels of these two Oct1 mutants were comparable to those of the wild type. Deletion of Oct1 in yeast results in loss of mitochondrial DNA. As a consequence OCT1 deletion strains are not viable on non-fermentable carbon sources (where mitochondrial respiration is essential for cell viability). Several of the known Oct1 substrates, e.g., Rip1 and Cox4, are subunits of the respiratory chain complexes or the mitochondrial ribosome, e.g., Mrp21,\nvitro and loss of YMIP activity leads to mitochondrial iron depletion, suggesting that YMIP is part of a feedback loop in which iron stimulates maturation of YMIP substrates and this in turn promotes mitochondrial iron uptake. Accordingly, YMIP is active and promotes mitochondrial iron accumulation in a mutant lacking Yfh1p ( yfh1 [Delta]), while genetic inactivation of YMIP in this mutant ( yfh1 [Delta] oct1 [Delta]) leads to a 2-fold reduction in mitochondrial iron levels. Moreover, overexpression of Yfh1p restores mitochondrial iron homeostasis and YMIP activity in a conditional oct1 ts mutant, but does not affect iron levels in a mutant completely lacking YMIP ( oct1 [Delta]). Thus, we propose that Yfh1p maintains mitochondrial iron homeostasis both directly, by promoting iron export, and indirectly, by regulating iron levels and therefore YMIP activity, which promotes mitochondrial iron uptake. This suggests that human MIP may contribute to the functional effects of frataxin",

Interaction was confirmed in a yeast two-hybrid assay, and co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the MP interacted only with the 2a polymerase protein. A yeast\nwith viral 1a protein in vitro, maintains activity and 1a selectivity in RNA replication. Brome mosaic virus (BMV), a member of the alphavirus-like super-family of positive-strand RNA viruses, encodes two proteins required for viral RNA replication: 1a and 2a. 1a contains m7G methyltransferase- and helicase-like domains, while 2a contains a polymerase (pol)-like core flanked by N- and C-terminal extensions. Genetic studies show that BMV RNA replication requires 1a-2a compatibility implying direct or indirect 1a-2a interaction in vivo. In vitro, la interacts with the N-terminal 125-amino-acid segment of 2a preceding the pol-like core, and prior deletion studies suggested that this 2a segment was essential for RNA replication. We have now used protein fusions and deletions to explore possible parallels between noncovalent 1a-2a interaction and covalent fusion of similar protein domains in tobacco mosaic virus and to see whether the N-terminal 2a-1a interaction was the primary basis for 1a-2a compatibility in vivo.\na yeast two-hybrid assay, and co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the MP interacted only with the 2a polymerase protein. A yeast three-hybrid assay showed that the 1a-2a protein interaction relevant for replicase complex formation was not affected by the MP. Although the MP has no affinity for the 1a protein, it interacted indirectly with the 1a protein via the 2a polymerase protein. These results suggest that the replicase complex may be involved in movement through its interaction with the MP. Proteolytic Processing of the Coronavirus Replicase Nonstructural Protein 14 Exonuclease Is Not Required for Virus Replication but Alters RNA Synthesis and Viral Fitness. Coronaviruses (CoVs) initiate replication by translation of the positive-sense RNA genome into the replicase polyproteins connecting 16 nonstructural protein domains (nsp1-16), which are subsequently processed by viral proteases to yield mature nsp. For the betacoronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV), total inhibition of translation or proteolytic processing of replicase\nfor nuclear transport. Infected cell extracts analyzed with microarrays, quantitative slot-blots and pulse-labeling experiments confirmed a nearly complete shutoff of host pol-II-dependent mRNA synthesis during EMCV infection, in reactions that depended on wild-type 2A protein. In contrast to human rhinovirus-16 infection, rRNA synthesis by pol-I and pol-III were not turned off by EMCV, although the cellular concentration of rRNA decreased during infection, relative to control samples. The data suggest that nuclear targeting by 2A and 3BCD may be responsible for regulating cellular mRNA and rRNA transcription during infection, perhaps via a proteolytic mechanism catalyzed by the endogenous 3C(pro) sequence. Crystal structure of poliovirus 3CD protein: virally encoded protease and precursor to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Poliovirus 3CD is a multifunctional protein that serves as a precursor to the protease 3C(pro) and the viral polymerase 3D(pol) and also plays a role in the control of viral replication. Although 3CD is a\ncells, consistent with a membrane-association of the replicase complex. Furthermore, in vitro transcription/translation studies of the MHV-JHM 3Cpro and flanking hydrophobic domains confirm that 3C protease activity is significantly enhanced in the presence of canine microsomal membranes. Overall, our results demonstrate that the MHV-JHM ORF1a polyprotein: (1) is processed into more than 10 protein intermediates and products, (2) requires membranes for efficient biogenesis, and (3) is detected in discrete membranous regions in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Encephalomyocarditis viral protein 2A localizes to nucleoli and inhibits cap-dependent mRNA translation. Panels of monoclonal antibodies were raised against viral non-structural proteins of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and used to probe infected cells in laser confocal microscopy experiments and Western analyses. Surprisingly, all Mengovirus and EMCV-infected cells showed strong targeting of protein 2A, 3B(VPg), 3C(pro), and 3D(pol) signals to cellular nuclei, in particular to nucleoli, from the earliest times of infection. Viral capsid proteins\nthe emergence of these infectious diseases. In this context, a thorough investigation of virus-host interactions is critical. Here, we highlight the importance of the host protein G3BP for several Old World alphaviruses. Our data strongly suggest that G3BP plays a crucial role for the activity of the viral replicase and, thus, the amplification of the viral RNA genome. To our knowledge, the present work is the first to provide a functional link between the regulation of viral polyprotein processing and RNA replication and a host factor for alphaviruses. Moreover, the results of this study raise several questions about the fundamental regulatory mechanisms that dictate the activity of the viral replicase, thereby paving the way for future studies. The polymerase-like core of brome mosaic virus 2a protein, lacking a region interacting with viral 1a protein in vitro, maintains activity and 1a selectivity in RNA replication. Brome mosaic virus (BMV), a member\n3C(pro), and 3D(pol) signals to cellular nuclei, in particular to nucleoli, from the earliest times of infection. Viral capsid proteins (1AB, 1C, and 1D) and other non-structural proteins (2B, 2C, and 3A) did not target nuclei and remained cytoplasmic throughout the infection. The cardioviral 2A protein (subject of this article) has a novel 143 amino acid sequence, terminating in a 19 amino acid COOH-terminal processing cassette (PCC) that participates in autocatalytic, co-translational primary cleavage of the viral polyprotein. The remainder of the 2A protein shares only limited similarity with other viral or cellular sequences, except for a short motif (KRvRPFRLP) near PCC resembling the nuclear localization signals (NLS) common to many yeast ribosomal proteins. Deletions within the EMCV 2A protein that impinge on this region have been reported to diminish the ability of virus to inhibit cap-dependent translation of cellular mRNAs. We have now observed that these same deletions prevented\nstudy replication complex assembly, as it enables improved composite polyprotein complex formation compared to traditional trans-complementation systems. Finally, the differential behavior of distinct NS3 helicase knockout mutations hints that certain conformations of this enzyme might be particularly deleterious for replication. Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) proteins 2A and 3BCD localize to nuclei and inhibit cellular mRNA transcription but not rRNA transcription. We have followed the viral processing cascade and polyprotein precursor fates during encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection of HeLa cells using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Within the first 2-4 h of infection, signals of antibodies specific for the 2A, 3B(VPg), 3C(pro) and 3D(pol) proteins were found to co-localize in nucleoli at the rRNA synthesis and cellular protein B23 (nucleophosmin) sites. Cellular fractionation identified viral protein precursor 3BCD as the common source of the P3-region antibody signals. Previously thought to be a minor product of the polymerase region cleavage pathways, the\nused circular dichroism spectroscopy and single molecule microscopy to examine the solution structure and self-association of the poliovirus P3 region protein composed of membrane binding 3A, RNA priming 3B (VPg), 3Cpro protease, and 3Dpol RNA-dependent RNA polymerase proteins. Our data indicate that co-folding interactions within the 3ABC segment stabilize the conformational state of the 3C protease region, and this stabilization requires the full-length 3A and 3B proteins. Enzymatic activity assays show that 3ABC is also an active protease, and it cleaves peptide substrates at rates comparable to 3Cpro. The cleavage of a larger polyprotein substrate is stimulated by the addition of RNA, and 3ABCpro becomes 20-fold more active than 3Cpro in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of viral cre RNA. The data suggest that co-folding within the 3ABC region results in a protease that can be highly activated toward certain cleavage sites by localization to specific RNA elements within the\nthe ability of virus to inhibit cap-dependent translation of cellular mRNAs. We have now observed that these same deletions prevented nuclear localization. Cellular expression of 2A protein from RNA transcripts or cDNAs confirmed that it does not require other viral proteins or activities for nuclear transport; even when expressed as a single protein, 2A protein effectively shuts off translation from capped reporter mRNAs. Within infected, transfected, or DNA vector-transformed cells, the 2A protein was always found in close association with the nucleolar ribosomal chaperone protein B23, which may help the traffic 2A into nucleoli like a surrogate ribosomal protein, by virtue of the putative nucleolar localization signal (NoLS). The data are consistent with a novel mechanism for virus-induced host protein shut off in cardioviruses, whereby 2A helps to upregulate the synthesis of new and modified ribosomes that have an inherent preference for internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-dependent viral genome translation\ntrans-replicase system allowed study of the effects of mutations in the ns-polyprotein on RNA replication in cells derived from mammalian and mosquito hosts. We found that a slowdown of ns-polyprotein processing facilitates replication complex formation and/or functioning in mosquito cells and that this process is antagonized by the natural RNAi defense system present in mosquito cells. The mosquito-adapted CHIKV trans-replicase system represents a valuable tool to study alphavirus-mosquito interactions at the molecular level and to develop advanced antiviral strategies. Intracellular localization and protein interactions of the gene 1 protein p28 during mouse hepatitis virus replication. Coronaviruses encode the largest replicase polyprotein of any known positive-strand RNA virus. Replicase protein precursors and mature products are thought to mediate the formation and function of viral replication complexes on the surfaces of intracellular double-membrane vesicles. However, the functions of only a few of these proteins are known. For the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus\nsource of the P3-region antibody signals. Previously thought to be a minor product of the polymerase region cleavage pathways, the nuclear targeting of this precursor was localized with engineered mutations to five P2 and P3 region polyprotein processing sites. A nuclear localization motif (NLS), similar to that in many yeast ribosomal proteins, was identified near the N-terminus of the 3D(pol) sequence. Point mutations within this motif prevented nuclear and nucleolar localization by all forms of 3B(VPg), 3C(pro) and 3D(pol), and were lethal to the virus because they also prevented genome replication. However, viral RNA synthesis was not required for nucleolar transport and 3BCD was found in nuclei, even when the 3D(pol) was inactivated. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed a tight association between 3BCD and B23 (nucleophosmin), suggesting a possible ribosomal protein-like mechanism for nuclear transport. Infected cell extracts analyzed with microarrays, quantitative slot-blots and pulse-labeling experiments confirmed a nearly complete shutoff of\nthe P2 and P3 domains of the polyprotein in the viral life cycle are different, we observed significant interactions between 2C(ATPase) and 3AB; 2A(pro) and 3A, 3C(pro) or 3D(pol); 2B and 3A or 3AB. All of the interactions were measured in the yeast two-hybrid system by exchanging the interacting pairs on the transcription-activation and DNA-binding constructs. In vitro GST pull-down assay suggested that the 2C(ATPase)/3AB interaction involves both ionic and hydrophobic contacts between the two proteins. The possible biological implication of the interactions observed in the yeast two-hybrid system will be discussed. Sensitivity of Alphaviruses to G3BP Deletion Correlates with Efficiency of Replicase Polyprotein Processing. We present a comprehensive overview of the dependency of several Old World alphaviruses for the host protein G3BP. Based on their replication ability in G3BP-deleted cells, Old World alphaviruses can be categorized into two groups, being either resistant or sensitive to G3BP deletion. We observed\npolyprotein complemented other defects shown to be dependent on NS3-5A for rescue. Overall, our findings suggest the existence of two interdependent sets of protein complexes supporting RNA replication, distinguishable by the minimum polyprotein requirement needed for their formation.IMPORTANCE: Positive-strand RNA viruses reshape the intracellular membranes of cells to form a compartment within which to replicate their genome, but little is known about the functional organization of viral proteins within this structure. We have complemented protein-encoded defects in HCV by constructing subgenomic HCV transcripts capable of simultaneously expressing both a mutated and functional polyprotein precursor needed for RNA genome replication (intragenomic replicons). Our results reveal that HCV relies on two interdependent sets of protein complexes to support viral replication. They also show that the intragenomic replicon offers a unique way to study replication complex assembly, as it enables improved composite polyprotein complex formation compared to traditional trans-complementation systems. Finally, the differential\nthe viral replicase assembly, we assessed the impact of DCV on the aggregation and tertiary structure of NS5A, the protein-protein interactions within the viral replicase and the quaternary structure of the viral replicase. We found that DCV did not affect aggregation and tertiary structure of NS5A. DCV induced a quaternary structural change of the viral replicase, as evidenced by selective increase of NS4B's sensitivity to proteinase K digestion. Mechanically, DCV impaired the NS4B-involved protein-protein interactions within the viral replicase. These phenotypes were consistent with the phenotypes of several reported NS4B mutants that abolish the viral replicase assembly. The DCV-resistant mutant Y93H was refractory to the DCV-induced reduction of the NS4B-involved protein interactions and the quaternary structural change of the viral replicase. In addition, Y93H reduced NS4B-involved protein-protein interactions within the viral replicase and attenuated viral replication. We propose that DCV may induce a positional change of NS5A, which allosterically affects\nsynthesis of new and modified ribosomes that have an inherent preference for internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-dependent viral genome translation over cap-dependent host mRNA translation. Hepatitis C virus NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir allosterically impairs NS4B-involved protein-protein interactions within the viral replicase and disrupts the replicase quaternary structure in a replicase assembly surrogate system. Daclatasvir (DCV) is a highly potent direct-acting antiviral that targets the non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and has been used with great clinical success. Previous studies have demonstrated its impact on viral replication complex assembly. However, the precise mechanisms by which DCV impairs the replication complex assembly remains elusive. In this study, by using HCV subgenomic replicons and a viral replicase assembly surrogate system in which the HCV NS3-5B polyprotein is expressed to mimic the viral replicase assembly, we assessed the impact of DCV on the aggregation and tertiary structure of NS5A, the protein-protein\nblocked, the influence of the P4 residue on the sensitivity to G3BP deletion is abolished. Immunofluorescence experiments with CHIKV replicase with manipulated processing indicate that the synthesis of double-stranded RNA is defective in the absence of G3BP and suggest a role of G3BP during negative-strand RNA synthesis. This study provides a functional link between the host protein G3BP and the P4 residue of the 1/2 site for viral RNA replication of Old World alphaviruses. While this suggests a link between G3BP proteins and viral replicase polyprotein processing, we propose that G3BP proteins do not have a regulatory role during polyprotein processing.IMPORTANCE Old World alphaviruses comprise several medically relevant viruses, including chikungunya virus and Ross River virus. Recurrent outbreaks and the lack of antivirals and vaccines demand ongoing research to fight the emergence of these infectious diseases. In this context, a thorough investigation of virus-host interactions is critical. Here, we highlight\nprecursor and encompasses all enzymatic activities required for viral RNA replication. nsPs interact with host components of which most are still poorly understood, especially in mosquitos. A CHIKV trans-replicase system that allows the uncoupling of RNA replication and nsP expression was adapted to mosquito cells and subsequently used for analysis of universal and host-specific effects of 17 different nonstructural polyprotein (ns-polyprotein) mutations. It was found that mutations blocking nsP enzymatic activities as well as insertions of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) into different nsPs had similar effects on trans-replicase activity regardless of the host (i.e., mammalian or mosquito). Mutations that slow down or accelerate ns-polyprotein processing generally had no effect or reduced trans-replicase activity in mammalian cells, while in mosquito cells most of them increased trans-replicase activity prominently. Increased RNA replication in mosquito cells was counteracted by an antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) response. Substitution of the W258 residue in the\nviral replicase and attenuated viral replication. We propose that DCV may induce a positional change of NS5A, which allosterically affects protein interactions within the replicase components and disrupts replicase assembly. Polyprotein-Driven Formation of Two Interdependent Sets of Complexes Supporting Hepatitis C Virus Genome Replication. UNLABELLED: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) requires proteins from the NS3-NS5B polyprotein to create a replicase unit for replication of its genome. The replicase proteins form membranous compartments in cells to facilitate replication, but little is known about their functional organization within these structures. We recently reported on intragenomic replicons, bicistronic viral transcripts expressing an authentic replicase from open reading frame 2 (ORF2) and a second duplicate nonstructural (NS) polyprotein from ORF1. Using these constructs and other methods, we have assessed the polyprotein requirements for rescue of different lethal point mutations across NS3-5B. Mutations readily tractable to rescue broadly fell into two groupings: those requiring expression of\nand the viral polymerase 3D(pol) and also plays a role in the control of viral replication. Although 3CD is a fully functional protease, it lacks polymerase activity. We have solved the crystal structures of 3CD at a 3.4-A resolution and the G64S fidelity mutant of 3D(pol) at a 3.0-A resolution. In the 3CD structure, the 3C and 3D domains are joined by a poorly ordered polypeptide linker, possibly to facilitate its cleavage, in an arrangement that precludes intramolecular proteolysis. The polymerase active site is intact in both the 3CD and the 3D(pol) G64S structures, despite the disruption of a network proposed to position key residues in the active site. Therefore, changes in molecular flexibility may be responsible for the differences in fidelity and polymerase activities. Extensive packing contacts between symmetry-related 3CD molecules and the approach of the 3C domain's N terminus to the VPg binding site suggest how 3D(pol) makes",

The oncogenicity transduced by FAM3C is executed via a novel interaction with the Ras-related protein RalA, triggering the downstream activation of the Src/Stat3 signaling cascade. Conclusions: Our study describes a novel mechanism for FAM3C-driven carcinogenesis and shed light on EV FAM3C as a driver for metastatic lung tumors that could be exploited for cancer therapeutics. The ubiquitin ligase UBE4A inhibits prostate cancer progression by targeting interleukin-like EMT inducer (ILEI). Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important prerequisite for metastasis to secondary organs. Interleukin-like EMT inducer (ILEI) protein has been shown to translationally upregulated during EMT and metastatic progression as a consequence of aberrant TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Our initial evaluation of FAM3C (encoding ILEI) and ILEI expression in normal prostate (PCS-440-010) and\nthrough FAM3C to maintain breast cancer stem cell self-renewal and invasiveness. The poly(rC) binding protein 1 gene (PCBP1) encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein E1 (hnRNPE1), a nucleic acid-binding protein that plays a tumor-suppressive role in the mammary epithelium by regulating phenotypic plasticity and cell fate. Following the loss of PCBP1 function, the FAM3C gene (encoding the Interleukin-like EMT inducer, or \"ILEI\" protein) and the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) gene are upregulated. Interaction between FAM3C and LIFR in the extracellular space induces phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3). Overexpression and/or hyperactivity of STAT3 has been detected in 40% of breast cancer cases and is associated with a poor prognosis. Herein, we characterize feed-forward regulation of LIFR expression in response to FAM3C/LIFR/STAT3 signaling in mammary epithelial cells. We show that PCBP1 upregulates LIFR transcription through activity at the LIFR promoter, and that FAM3C participates in transcriptional regulation\nfactors related to FAM3C/ILEI dimerization. We also identified four possible inhibitor candidates, expected to be exciting prototypes and could be submitted to future biological tests targeting cancer treatment. Covalent dimerization of interleukin-like epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inducer (ILEI) facilitates EMT, invasion, and late aspects of metastasis. The interleukin-like epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inducer (ILEI)/FAM3C is a member of the highly homologous FAM3 family and is essential for EMT and metastasis formation. It is upregulated in several cancers, and its altered subcellular localization strongly correlates with poor survival. However, the mechanism of ILEI action, including the structural requirements for ILEI activity, remains elusive. Here, we show that ILEI formed both monomers and covalent dimers in cancer cell lines and in tumors. Using mutational analysis and pulse-chase experiments, we found that the four ILEI cysteines, conserved throughout the FAM3 family and involved in disulfide bond formation were essential for extracellular ILEI accumulation in cultured\na panel of NSCLC cell lines, and correlated to the invasive and metastatic potentials. Functional phenotype of endogenous FAM3C and tumor-derived EVs (TDEs) were further investigated using various biological approaches in RNA and protein levels. Metastasis potential of TDEs secreted by FAM3C-overexpressing carcinoma cells was validated in mouse models. Results: Transcriptomic meta-analysis of pan-cancer datasets confirmed the overexpression of FAM3C - a gene encoding for interleukin-like EMT inducer (ILEI) - in NSCLC tumors, with strong association with poor patient prognosis and cancer metastasis. Aberrant expression of FAM3C in lung carcinoma cells enhances cellular transformation and promotes distant lung tumor colonization. In addition, higher FAM3C concentrations were detected in EVs extracted from plasma samples of NSCLC patients compared to those of healthy subjects. More importantly, we defined a hitherto-unknown mode of microenvironmental crosstalk involving FAM3C in EVs, whereby the delivery and uptake of FAM3C via TDEs enhances oncogenic signaling - in\nas a domain-swapped dimer. Production and secretion of pro-metastatic proteins is a feature of many tumor cells. The FAM3C interleukin-like epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) inducer (ILEI) has been shown to be strongly up-regulated in several cancers and to be essential for tumor formation and metastasis in epithelial cells, correlating with a significant decrease in overall survival in colon and breast cancer patients. ILEI has been seen to interact with the \u03b3-secretase presenilin 1 subunit (PS1). However, not much is known about the mechanism-of-action or the detailed ILEI structure. We present here the crystal structures of FAM3C ILEI and show that it exists as monomers but also as covalent dimers. The observed ILEI \u03b2-\u03b2-\u03b1 fold confirmed previous indications that the FAM3C proteins do not form classical four-helix-bundle structures as was initially predicted. This provides the first experimental evidence that the interleukin-like EMT inducers are not evolutionarily related to the interleukins. However, more surprisingly,\nFam3b] that preserve cardiomyocyte viability, sustain cardiac function, and prevent pathological remodeling. In particular, Chrdl1 exerted its protective activity by binding and inhibiting extracellular bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), which resulted in protection against cardiomyocyte death and induction of autophagy in cardiomyocytes after myocardial infarction. Chrdl1 also inhibited fibrosis and maladaptive cardiac remodeling by binding transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and preventing cardiac fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts. Production of secreted and circulating Chrdl1, Fam3c, and Fam3b from the liver also protected the heart from myocardial infarction, thus supporting the use of the three proteins as recombinant factors. Together, these findings disclose a powerful method for the in vivo, unbiased selection of tissue-protective factors and describe potential cardiac therapeutics. The interleukin-like epithelial-mesenchymal transition inducer ILEI exhibits a non-interleukin-like fold and is active as a domain-swapped dimer. Production and secretion of pro-metastatic proteins is a feature of many tumor cells. The FAM3C interleukin-like\nof EMT based on immortalized p19(ARF) null hepatocytes (MIM), which display tumor growth upon expression of oncogenic Ras and undergo EMT through the synergism of Ras and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. Here, we show that the interleukin-related protein interleukin-like EMT inducer (ILEI), a novel EMT-, tumor- and metastasis-inducing protein, cooperates with oncogenic Ras to cause TGF-beta-independent EMT. Ras-transformed MIM hepatocytes overexpressing ILEI showed cytoplasmic E-cadherin, loss of ZO-1 and induction of alpha-smooth muscle actin as well as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)/PDGF-R isoforms. As shown by dominant-negative PDGF-R expression in these cells, ILEI-induced PDGF signaling was required for enhanced cell migration, nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin, nuclear pY-Stat3 and accelerated growth of lung metastases. In MIM hepatocytes expressing the Ras mutant V12-C40, ILEI collaborated with PI3K signaling resulting in tumor formation without EMT. Clinically, human HCC samples showed granular or cytoplasmic localization of ILEI correlating with well and poorly differentiated tumors, respectively.\nStructural analysis of factors related to FAM3C/ILEI dimerization and identification of inhibitor candidates targeting cancer treatment. FAM3 is a superfamily of four cytokines that maintain a single globular structure \u03b2 -\u03b2 -\u03b1 of three classes: FAM3A, B, C and D. FAM3C was the first member of this family related to cancer and is functionally characterized as an essential factor for the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), leading to late delays in tumor progression. Due to its crucial role in EMT and metastasis, FAM3C has been termed an interleukin-like EMT (ILEI) inducer. There are several studies on the part of FAM3C in the progression of cancer and other diseases. However, little is known about its cellular receptors and possible inhibitors. In this study, based on in silico approaches, we performed structural analyses of factors related to FAM3C/ILEI dimerization. We also identified four possible inhibitor candidates, expected to be exciting prototypes and could be\nmRNP complex regulating tumorigenesis at the translational elongation step Establishment of a TGF\u03b2-induced post-transcriptional EMT gene signature Cloning, expression, and initial characterization of a novel cytokine-like gene family The FAM3 superfamily member ILEI ameliorates Alzheimer\u2019s disease-like pathology by destabilizing the penultimate amyloid-\u03b2 precursor Secreted factor FAM3C (ILEI) is involved in retinal laminar formation Fam3c modulates osteogenic cell differentiation and affects bone volume and cortical bone mineral density ILEI: a cytokine essential for EMT, tumor formation, and late events in metastasis in epithelial cells ILEI requires oncogenic Ras for the epithelial to mesenchymal transition of hepatocytes and liver carcinoma progression Interleukin-like epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition inducer activity is controlled by proteolytic processing and plasminogen-urokinase plasminogen activator receptor system-regulated secretion during breast cancer progression Activation of an IL6 inflammatory loop mediates trastuzumab resistance in HER2+ breast cancer by expanding the cancer stem cell population Role of the IL-6-JAK1-STAT3-Oct-4 pathway in the conversion of non-stem\nidentified the secreted cytokine interleukin-like EMT inducer (ILEI) as a member of a cohort of mRNAs involved in EMT that are regulated by TGF\u03b2/hnRNP E1 through a 3\u2019-UTR-mediated translational silencing mechanism . To examine whether TGF\u03b2-induced expression of ILEI is necessary and/or sufficient to activate an EMT program, we introduced either scramble control or ILEI-specific shRNA constructs into the NMuMG and E1KD cell lines (referred to as NMuMG and E1KD shSCR/shILEI). Figure 2a demonstrates successful silencing of ILEI protein levels in NMuMG shILEI cells when compared to NMuMG shSCR lines after TGF\u03b2 stimulation for 24 hours, whereas E1KD shSCR cells that possess constitutive ILEI translation, lose this expression level after ILEI shRNA silencing (Fig. 2a). This effect is also observed in the secretion of the mature processed 18kD ILEI protein from the various cell lines after analysis of the conditioned media (Fig. 2b). To test TGF\u03b2 responsiveness in these cell\ntransition (EMT) progress, but the detailed mechanism was unclear. Here, we identified ectopic expression of TMTC3 in cells undergoing ER stress and verified the association with EMT markers through the cellular model of ER stress and database analysis. TMTC3 was abnormally highly expressed in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), and regulated by TP63, an SCCs-specific transcription factor. Biological function experiments indicated that TMTC3 promoted a malignant phenotype in vitro, and accelerated tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. RNA-seq analyses and further experiments revealed that TMTC3 promoted the expression of EMT markers via interleukin-like EMT inducer (ILEI, FAM3C). Further studies on the mechanism showed that TMTC3 disrupted the interaction between PERK and GRP78 to activate the PERK pathway and promote the nuclear translocation of ATF4, which increased the transcriptional activity of ILEI. These findings indicated that TMTC3 activates GRP78/PERK signaling pathway during ER stress-induced EMT, which might serve as a potential therapeutic\nEMT. Clinically, human HCC samples showed granular or cytoplasmic localization of ILEI correlating with well and poorly differentiated tumors, respectively. In conclusion, these data indicate that ILEI requires cooperation with oncogenic Ras to govern hepatocellular EMT through mechanisms involving PDGF-R/beta-catenin and PDGF-R/Stat3 signaling. TGF\u03b2 promotes breast cancer stem cell self-renewal through an ILEI/LIFR signaling axis FAM3C/Interleukin-like EMT Inducer (ILEI) is an oncogenic member of the FAM3 cytokine family and serves essential roles in both epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and breast cancer metastasis. ILEI expression levels are regulated through a non-canonical TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway by 3\u2019-UTR-mediated translational silencing at the mRNA level by hnRNP E1. TGF\u03b2 stimulation or silencing of hnRNP E1 increases ILEI translation and induces an EMT program that correlates to enhanced invasion and migration. Recently, EMT has been linked to the formation of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) that confer both tumor cell heterogeneity as well as chemoresistant properties.\nelongation factor 1A1 (eEF1a1) that binds a structurally conserved 3\u2019-UTR or BAT element (TGF\u03b2 activated translation) and inhibits translation of several mRNAs involved in EMT . TGF\u03b2 signaling initiates a non-canonical kinase cascade that results in Akt2-mediated phosphorylation of hnRNP-E1 at serine 43. Subsequently, hnRNP E1 complexes are released from EMT related mRNA transcripts, translation is restored, and EMT progresses. Using a genome-wide combinatorial approach by expression profiling and RIP-Chip analysis, our lab revealed a cohort of over 30 mRNAs that are controlled by the 3\u2019-UTR BAT mechanism of translational regulation by TGF\u03b2 . Knockdown of hnRNP E1 within normal mammary epithelial cells results in a transition to a mesenchymal, invasive and migratory state, and drives spontaneous tumor formation in a xenografts mouse model . Analysis of the mRNAs translationally regulated by hnRNP E1 revealed FAM3C, also known as interleukin-like EMT inducer (ILEI), a cytokine analyzed for its role in\nregulated by hnRNP E1 revealed FAM3C, also known as interleukin-like EMT inducer (ILEI), a cytokine analyzed for its role in EMT and tumorigenesis. ILEI is a member of the FAM3 family of secreted cytokines and was discovered through a sequence based search for predicted four-helical bundle cytokines . ILEI has been shown to play a role in a variety of biological processes including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, retinal laminar formation, and bone density regulation . In the context of epithelial tumorigenesis, ILEI serves an essential role in EMT activation and metastatic progression after translational upregulation by TGF\u03b2. Subsequent N-terminal processing and secretion results in the full-length 25kD molecule being reduced to a 18kD variant that functions within the extracellular space . Although these studies demonstrate an important role for ILEI in disease, mechanistic studies and identification of the extracellular receptor mediating ILEI function has yielded little progress. The previously described role of\nprovides the first experimental evidence that the interleukin-like EMT inducers are not evolutionarily related to the interleukins. However, more surprisingly, the ILEI dimer structure was found to feature a trans-linked domain swap, converting an intramolecular disulfide to intermolecular. Interestingly, dimeric but not monomeric ILEI was subsequently found to cause a dose-dependent increase in EpRas cell invasiveness comparable with TGF-\u03b2, indicating that the dimer might be the active ILEI species. This is in line with a parallel study showing that covalent oligomerization of ILEI is essential for EMT and tumor progression in vivo The structures and the activity data give some first insight into the relationship between dimerization and ILEI function as well as indicate an intriguing link between ILEI, the PS1-protease, TGF-\u03b2, and the TGF-\u03b2 receptor 1. PCBP1 regulates LIFR through FAM3C to maintain breast cancer stem cell self-renewal and invasiveness. The poly(rC) binding protein 1 gene (PCBP1) encodes the\nlung metastases in nude mice, while cells overexpressing the dimerization-defective C185A mutant behaved similar to control cells. These data show that covalent ILEI self-assembly is essential for EMT induction, elevated tumor growth, and metastasis. FAM3C in circulating tumor-derived extracellular vesicles promotes non-small cell lung cancer growth in secondary sites. Rationale: Metastasis is a complex process with a molecular underpinning that remains unclear. We hypothesize that cargo proteins conducted by extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from tumors may confer growth and metastasis potential on recipient cells. Here, we report that a cytokine-like secreted protein, FAM3C, contributes to late-stage lung tumor progression. Methods: EV protein profiling was conducted with an unbiased proteomic mass spectrometry analysis on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and normal lung fibroblast cell lines. Expression of FAM3C was confirmed in a panel of NSCLC cell lines, and correlated to the invasive and metastatic potentials. Functional phenotype of endogenous FAM3C and\nThese findings indicated that TMTC3 activates GRP78/PERK signaling pathway during ER stress-induced EMT, which might serve as a potential therapeutic target in SCCs. ILEI is an important intermediate participating in the formation of TGF-\u03b21-induced renal tubular EMT. Renal interstitial fibrosis is the most common process by which chronic kidney diseases progress to end-stage renal failure. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) play a crucial role in the progression of renal interstitial fibrosis. A newly identified cytokine, interleukin-like EMT inducer (ILEI), has been linked to EMT in some diseases. However, the effects of ILEI on renal tubular EMT have not yet been well established. Here, we characterize the expression of ILEI in tubular EMT and describe the role and mechanism of ILEI in transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21)-induced renal tubular EMT. The results indicate that ILEI is involved in renal tubular EMT induced by TGF-\u03b21, as overexpression of ILEI not only induces EMT\nE1KD cells in a dose-dependent manner, with both cell types exhibiting co-localization within the spheroids (Fig. 1e quantification, Fig. 1f for RFP-NMuMG and GFP-E1KD co-culture images by immunofluorescence). To delineate between self-renewal induced by E1KD generated cell surface proteins and secreted factors, conditioned media (CM) collected from 7-day E1KD mammospheres was used to culture with the NMuMG parental cell line. The CM from E1KD cells was sufficient to increase, in a dose-dependent manner, the mammosphere growth of RFP-expressing NMuMG cells (Fig. 1g quantification; Fig. 1h for NMuMG-RFP mammosphere immunofluorescence upon E1KD conditioned media treatment). Therefore, a secreted factor derived from modulation of hnRNP E1 may play a critical role in TGF\u03b2-induced BCSC formation and self-renewal. The Secreted Cytokine ILEI is Necessary for TGF\u03b2/hnRNP E1-Mediated EMT and BCSC formation Previously, we identified the secreted cytokine interleukin-like EMT inducer (ILEI) as a member of a cohort of mRNAs involved in EMT that\nindicate that ILEI is involved in renal tubular EMT induced by TGF-\u03b21, as overexpression of ILEI not only induces EMT of HK-2 cells independently but also profoundly enhances EMT in response to TGF-\u03b21. Supporting this finding, ILEI small interfering RNA was found to block the EMT of HK-2 cells induced by TGF-\u03b21. This work additionally suggests ILEI mediates TGF-\u03b21-dependent EMT via the extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERKs) and protein kinase B (Akt) signalling pathways. In conclusion, ILEI appears to play a crucial role in mediating TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT through the Akt and ERK pathways, which may provide a therapeutic target for the treatment of fibrotic kidney diseases.SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: There is no study reporting the effect of ILEI in renal EMTs. In this research, we examined the role and mechanism of ILEI in EMT using tubular epithelial cell; we found that ILEI participated in renal tubular EMT, and overexpression of\nWe show that PCBP1 upregulates LIFR transcription through activity at the LIFR promoter, and that FAM3C participates in transcriptional regulation of LIFR. Additionally, our bioinformatic analysis reveals a signature of transcriptional regulation associated with FAM3C/LIFR interaction and identifies the TWIST1 transcription factor as a downstream effector that participates in the maintenance of LIFR expression. Finally, we characterize the effect of LIFR expression in cell-based experiments that demonstrate the promotion of invasion, migration, and self-renewal of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), consistent with previous studies linking LIFR expression to tumor initiation and metastasis in mammary epithelial cells. FAM3C/ILEI protein is elevated in psoriatic lesions and triggers psoriasiform hyperproliferation in mice. FAM3C/ILEI is an important cytokine for tumor progression and metastasis. However, its involvement in inflammation remains elusive. Here, we show that ILEI protein is highly expressed in psoriatic lesions. Inducible keratinocyte-specific ILEI overexpression in mice (K5-ILEIind ) recapitulates many aspects of",

NMR and X-RAY structures of human E2-like ubiquitin-fold modifier conjugating enzyme 1 (UFC1) reveal structural and functional conservation in the metazoan UFM1-UBA5-UFC1 ubiquination pathway. For cell regulation, E2-like ubiquitin-fold modifier conjugating enzyme 1 (Ufc1) is involved in the transfer of ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (Ufm1), a ubiquitin like protein which is activated by E1-like enzyme Uba5, to various target proteins. Thereby, Ufc1 participates in the very recently discovered Ufm1-Uba5-Ufc1 ubiquination pathway which is found in metazoan organisms. The structure of human Ufc1 was solved by using both NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The complementary insights obtained with the two techniques provided a unique basis for understanding the function of Ufc1 at atomic resolution. The Ufc1 structure consists of the catalytic core domain conserved in all E2-like enzymes and an additional N-terminal helix. The active site Cys(116),\nstructure of Ufc1, the Ufm1-conjugating enzyme. Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like protein-conjugating enzymes play central roles in posttranslational modification processes. The ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (Ufm1), one of a variety of ubiquitin-like modifiers, is covalently attached to target proteins via Uba5 and Ufm1-conjugating enzyme 1 (Ufc1), which are analogous to the E1 and E2 ubiquitylation enzymes. As Ufm1-related proteins are conserved in metazoa and plants, the Ufm1 system likely plays important roles in various multicellular organisms. Herein, we report the X-ray structure of human Ufc1 determined at 1.6 A resolution. The Ufc1 structure comprises a canonical E2 domain and an additional N-terminal domain. The Uba5 binding site on Ufc1 was assigned by structural comparison of Ufc1 and Ubc12 and related mutational analyses. In addition, we show that the N-terminal unique domain of Ufc1 contributes to thermal stability. Solution structure of TbUfm1 from Trypanosoma brucei and its binding to TbUba5.

In this report, we describe the identification of a novel ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (Ufm1) with a molecular mass of 9.1 kDa, displaying apparently similar tertiary structure, although lacking obvious sequence identity, to ubiquitin. Ufm1 is first cleaved at the C-terminus to expose its conserved Gly residue. This Gly residue is essential for its subsequent conjugating reactions. The C-terminally processed Ufm1 is activated by a novel E1-like enzyme, Uba5, by forming a high-energy thioester bond. Activated Ufm1 is then transferred to its cognate E2-like enzyme, Ufc1, in a similar thioester linkage. Ufm1 forms several complexes in HEK293 cells and mouse tissues, revealing that it conjugates to the target proteins. Ufm1, Uba5, and Ufc1 are all conserved in metazoa and plants but not in yeast, suggesting its potential roles in various multicellular organisms. Proximity Proteomics and Biochemical Analysis Reveal a Noncanonical Function for UFM1-Specific Protease\nproteins for degradation by the proteasome. However, ubiquitilation can also affect subcellular localization, interactions, stability or activity of the substrate protein. Therefore, ubiquitin can participate in a wide variety of cellular processes. Besides ubiquitin, a large family of ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls) has been identified. These proteins do not necessarily share a high degree of sequence similarity to ubiquitin, but they all contain the typical ubiquitin-like tertiary structure. Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 or UFM1 has recently been identified as a novel protein-conjugating system, displaying a similar tertiary structure to ubiquitin. To be activated, UFM1 is processed C-terminally by two specific proteases, UfSP1 and UfSP2. After processing, UFM1 is activated via the E1 enzyme, UBA5, and then conjugated by the E2 enzyme, UFC1. UFL1 has very recently been identified as the E3 enzyme and C20orf116 as a substrate of UFM1. However, cellular functions associated withtarget proteins that aremodified by UFM1 are still unknown.\nthe ufmylation cascade and effective interaction between them. We found that the last 20 residues in UBA5 are pivotal for binding to UFC1 and can accelerate the transfer of UFM1 to UFC1. We solved the structure of a complex of UFC1 and a peptide spanning the last 20 residues of UBA5 by NMR spectroscopy. This structure in combination with additional NMR titration and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments revealed the mechanism of interaction and confirmed the importance of the C-terminal unstructured region in UBA5 for the ufmylation cascade.

These UBLs are covalently linked to most, if not all, target protein(s) through an enzymatic cascade analogous to ubiquitylation, consisting of E1 (activating), E2 (conjugating), and E3 (ligating) enzymes.

This process is tightly associated with post-translational modifications (PTMs) of ER\u03b1 and its co-activators for promotion of transcriptional activation, which leads to proliferation of a large subset of breast tumor cells. These PTMs include phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, and conjugation by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins. Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (UFM1), one of ubiquitin-like proteins, has recently been shown to be ligated to activating signal co-integrator 1 (ASC1), which acts as a transcriptional co-activator of nuclear receptors. Here, we discuss the mechanistic connection between ASC1 modification by UFM1 and ER\u03b1 transactivation, and highlight how the interplay of these processes is involved in development of breast cancer. We also discuss potential use of UFM1-conjugating system as therapeutic targets against not only breast cancer but also other nuclear receptor-mediated cancers.

Ubiquitin-like proteins are conserved in eukaryotes and involved in numerous cellular processes. Ufm1 is proved to play important roles in endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis, vesicle transportation and embryonic development. Enzyme cascade of Ufm1 is similar to that of ubiquitin. Mature Ufm1 is activated and conjugated to substrates by assistance of Ufm1 activating enzyme Uba5 (E1), Ufm1 conjugating enzyme Ufc1 (E2), and Ufm1 ligating enzyme Ufl1 (E3). Here, we determined the solution structure of TbUfm1 from Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei) by NMR spectroscopy and explored the interactions between TbUfm1 and TbUba5/TbUfc1/TbUfl1. TbUfm1 adopts a typical \u03b2-grasp fold, which partially wraps a central \u03b1-helix and the other two helixes. NMR chemical shift perturbation indicated that TbUfm1 interacts with TbUba5 via a hydrophobic pocket formed by \u03b11\u03b12\u03b21\u03b22. Although the structure and Uba5-interaction mode of TbUfm1 are conserved in\nin processes such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein degradation, ribosome-associated protein quality control (RQC) at the ER (ER-RQC), and ER-phagy. However, it remains unclear how ufmylation regulates such distinct ER-related functions. Here, we provide insights into the mechanism of the UFM1 E3 complex in not only ufmylation but also ER-RQC. The E3 complex consisting of UFL1 and UFBP1 interacted with UFC1, UFM1 E2, and, subsequently, CDK5RAP3, an adaptor for ufmylation of ribosomal subunit RPL26. Upon disome formation, the E3 complex associated with ufmylated RPL26 on the 60S subunit through the UFM1-interacting region of UFBP1. Loss of E3 components or disruption of the interaction between UFBP1 and ufmylated RPL26 attenuated ER-RQC. These results provide insights into not only the molecular basis of the ufmylation but also its role in proteostasis. Crystal structure of Ufc1, the Ufm1-conjugating enzyme.

Proximity Proteomics and Biochemical Analysis Reveal a Noncanonical Function for UFM1-Specific Protease 1 in the p62 Body Formation. Protein aggregates play crucial roles in the development of neurodegenerative diseases and p62 is one of the key proteins regulating the formation of protein aggregates. Recently, it has been discovered that depletion of several key enzymes including UFM1-activating enzyme UBA5, UFM1-conjugating enzyme UFC1, UFM1-protein ligase UFL1, and UFM1-specific protease UfSP2 in the UFM1-conjugation system induces p62 accumulation to form p62 bodies in the cytosol. However, it is unknown whether UfSP1 participates in the formation of p62 bodies and whether its enzymatic activity is required for this process. Here, the proximity labeling technique and quantitative proteomics identify SQSTM1/p62 as a UfSP1-interacting protein. Coimmunoprecipitation reveals that p62 indeed interacts with UfSP1 and the immunofluorescence experiment discloses that UfSP1 colocalizes with p62 and promotes the formation of\nAn equal amount of protein was loaded on gel.

Identification of the interactions between UFM1, UFBP1, CDK5RAP3 and UFL1 To identify the target(s) of UFM1, we performed a UFM1 affinity purification. We engineered a STrEP-tag at the N-terminus of UFM1and transfected clonal insulin-producing MIN6 cells with this STrEP-Ufm1 construct. We exposed the cells for 2 hours to 10 mg/l cycloheximide to increase UFM1 conjugation (see below). STrEP-UFM1 was affinity purified and the eluates were analyzed via SDS-PAGE and coomassie staining (Figure S2A). In total, 9 protein fragments were eluted from gel and further analyzed via mass spectrometry (Table 1). We identified the conjugating enzyme UFC1 in the\u223c20 and \u223c36 kDa fragment and the activating enzyme UBA5 in the \u223c45 kDa and \u223c60 kDa protein fragments. Also the very recently\nconsists of the catalytic core domain conserved in all E2-like enzymes and an additional N-terminal helix. The active site Cys(116), which forms a thio-ester bond with Ufm1, is located in a flexible loop that is highly solvent accessible. Based on the Ufc1 and Ufm1 NMR structures, a model could be derived for the Ufc1-Ufm1 complex in which the C-terminal Gly(83) of Ufm1 may well form the expected thio-ester with Cys(116), suggesting that Ufm1-Ufc1 functions as described for other E1-E2-E3 machineries. alpha-helix 1 of Ufc1 adopts different conformations in the crystal and in solution, suggesting that this helix plays a key role to mediate specificity. Structural basis for Ufm1 processing by UfSP1. Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (Ufm1) is a newly identified ubiquitin-like protein. Like ubiquitin and other ubiquitin-like proteins, Ufm1 is synthesized as a precursor that needs to be processed to expose the conserved C-terminal glycine prior to its conjugation to target\nUFL1 and UBA5 for binding to UFC1. This competition changes in the favor of UFL1 following UFM1 charging of UFC1. Altogether, our study reveals a novel, terminal helix-mediated regulatory mechanism, which coordinates the cascade of E1-E2-E3-mediated transfer of UFM1 to its substrate and provides new leads to target this modification.

While the enzymatic cascade of UFM1 conjugation has been elucidated in recent years, the biological function remains largely unknown. In this report we demonstrate that the recently identified C20orf116, which we name UFM1-binding protein 1 containing a PCI domain (UFBP1), andCDK5RAP3 interact with UFM1. Components of the UFM1 conjugation pathway (UFM1, UFBP1, UFL1 and CDK5RAP3) are highly expressed in pancreatic islets of Langerhans and some other secretory tissues. Co-localization of UFM1 with UFBP1\nfrom the \"Asp-Pro-His\" box. The Asp-Pro-His configuration seen in UfSP1, together with Atg4B and M48(USP), seem to form a new subfamily of the cysteine protease superfamily. The mutagenesis study of the active site residues confirms structural basis for catalysis. The interaction between UfSP1 and Ufm1 appears quite substantial, since the K(D) value was estimated to be 1.6 mum by the isothermal titration calorimetry analysis. Furthermore, the NMR data shows that the loop between beta3 and alpha2 in addition to the C-terminal region of Ufm1 plays a role in binding to UfSP1. Mechanistic insights into the roles of the UFM1 E3 ligase complex in ufmylation and ribosome-associated protein quality control. Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (UFM1) is a ubiquitin-like protein covalently conjugated with intracellular proteins through ufmylation, similar to ubiquitylation. Ufmylation is involved in processes such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein degradation, ribosome-associated protein quality control (RQC) at the ER (ER-RQC), and ER-phagy.\nA Concerted Action of UBA5 C-Terminal Unstructured Regions Is Important for Transfer of Activated UFM1 to UFC1. Ubiquitin fold modifier 1 (UFM1) is a member of the ubiquitin-like protein family. UFM1 undergoes a cascade of enzymatic reactions including activation by UBA5 (E1), transfer to UFC1 (E2) and selective conjugation to a number of target proteins via UFL1 (E3) enzymes. Despite the importance of ufmylation in a variety of cellular processes and its role in the pathogenicity of many human diseases, the molecular mechanisms of the ufmylation cascade remains unclear. In this study we focused on the biophysical and biochemical characterization of the interaction between UBA5 and UFC1. We explored the hypothesis that the unstructured C-terminal region of UBA5 serves as a regulatory region, controlling cellular localization of the elements of the ufmylation cascade and effective interaction between them. We found that the last 20 residues in UBA5 are pivotal for\nusing both mouse isolated islets and the cell lines INS1 and MIN6. Our results show thatUFM1 and its target UFBP1are highly expressed in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans, and that their expression is increased upon ER stress.We provide evidence that UFM1 and UFBP1are important for the prevention of ER stress-induced apoptosis. Results Ufm1 is highly expressed in pancreatic islets of Langerhans Both in microarray mRNA expression analysis in the mouse (Figure 1A)and via quantitative real-time PCR, using Ufm1-specific primers and probe (Figure S1)the transcript encoding Ufm1 (Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1) was found to be very abundant in protein-secreting cells, especially pancreatic acini, islets of Langerhans and salivary glands. Furthermore, Ufm1 mRNA levels in islets were higher in fed mice, as compared to mice that were fasted for 20 hours (Figure 1B). A similar tissue distribution was observed at the protein level, using a UFM1-specific antibody (Figure 1C). Not only free UFM1\nadenylation domain that is dispensable for UFC1 binding but critical for UFM1 transfer. This region moves next to UFC1's active site Cys and compensates for a missing loop in UFC1, which exists in other E2s and is needed for the transfer. Overall, our findings advance the understanding of UFM1's conjugation machinery and may serve as a basis for the development of ufmylation inhibitors. A non-canonical scaffold-type E3 ligase complex mediates protein UFMylation. Protein UFMylation, i.e., post-translational modification with ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (UFM1), is essential for cellular and endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis. Despite its biological importance, we have a poor understanding of how UFM1 is conjugated onto substrates. Here, we use a rebuilding approach to define the minimal requirements of protein UFMylation. We find that the reported cognate E3 ligase UFL1 is inactive on its own and instead requires the adaptor protein UFBP1 to form an active E3 ligase complex.

Protein isolation, subcellular fractionation and immunoprecipitation For total protein extraction, tissues were immediately washed with PBS after dissection and lysed in S1 buffer (50 mMTris, pH 8; 0.4% NP-40; 150 mMNaCl; 1 mM EDTA; proteinase inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche); 1 mM PMSF; 2 mM N-ethylmaleimide), using a pestle for homogenization.

Our findings highlight the power of integrative omics and biochemical analyses for annotating the functions of poorly characterized signaling proteins. Distinct regulatory properties of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase and phosphatase isoforms. The mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) plays central and strategic roles in the control of the use of glucose-linked substrates as sources of oxidative energy or as precursors in the biosynthesis of fatty acids. The activity of this mitochondrial complex is regulated by the continuous operation of competing pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP) reactions. The resulting interconversion cycle determines the fraction of active (nonphosphorylated) pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component. Tissue-specific and metabolic state-specific control is achieved by the selective expression and distinct regulatory properties of at least four\nthe lipoic acid. We propose a mechanism in which the closure of the lipoic acid binding site is triggered by the formation of the intermolecular (PDP1c/L2) Ca2+ binding site in a manner reminiscent of the Ca2+ -induced closure of the regulatory domain of troponin C. Crystal structure of the catalytic subunit of bovine pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase. Mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity is tightly regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, which is catalyzed by PDH kinase isomers and PDH phosphatase isomers, respectively. PDH phosphatase isomer 1 (PDP1) is a heterodimer consisting of a catalytic subunit (PDP1c) and a regulatory subunit (PDP1r). Here, the crystal structure of bovine PDP1c determined at 2.1 \u00c5 resolution is reported. The crystals belonged to space group P3221, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 75.3, c = 173.2 \u00c5. The structure was solved by molecular-replacement methods and refined to a final R factor of 21.9% (Rfree =\ninvestigate this hypothesis, the interactions between PP2A-B'\u03b6 and the enzymes involved in the mitochondrial energy flow were investigated using bimolecular fluorescence complementation in tobacco and onion cells. Interactions were confirmed between the B'\u03b6 subunit and the Krebs cycle proteins succinate/fumarate translocator (mSFC1), malate dehydrogenase (mMDH2), and aconitase (ACO3). Additional putative interacting candidates were deduced by comparing the enriched phosphoproteomes of wild type and B'\u03b6 mutants: the mitochondrial regulator Arabidopsis pentatricopeptide repeat 6 (PPR6) and the two metabolic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PPC3) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1). Overall, this study identifies potential PP2A substrates and highlights the role of PP2A in regulating energy metabolism in mitochondria. Integrative proteomics and biochemical analyses define Ptc6p as the Saccharomyces cerevisiae pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is the primary metabolic checkpoint connecting glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and is important for maintaining cellular and organismal glucose homeostasis. Phosphorylation of the PDC E1 subunit\nCrystal structure of pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 and its functional implications. Pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 (PDP1) catalyzes dephosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) in the mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), whose activity is regulated by the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle by the corresponding protein kinases (PDHKs) and phosphatases. The activity of PDP1 is greatly enhanced through Ca2+ -dependent binding of the catalytic subunit (PDP1c) to the L2 (inner lipoyl) domain of dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2), which is also integrated in PDC. Here, we report the crystal structure of the rat PDP1c at 1.8 A resolution. The structure reveals that PDP1 belongs to the PPM family of protein serine/threonine phosphatases, which, in spite of a low level of sequence identity, share the structural core consisting of the central beta-sandwich flanked on both sides by loops and alpha-helices. Consistent with the previous studies, two well-fixed magnesium ions are coordinated by five active site residues and five\nstabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) by loss of substrate inhibition of prolyl-4-hydroxylases (PHDs). HIF-1\u03b1-mediated retrograde signaling results in a metabolic reprogramming that resembles hypoxic and cancer cell adaptation. Indeed, we observe that Poldip2 expression is down-regulated by hypoxia in a variety of cell types and basally repressed in triple-negative cancer cells, leading to inhibition of lipoylation of the pyruvate and \u03b1-KDH complexes and mitochondrial dysfunction. Increasing mitochondrial lipoylation by forced expression of Poldip2 increases respiration and reduces the growth rate of cancer cells. Our work unveils a regulatory mechanism of catabolic enzymes required for metabolic plasticity and highlights the role of Poldip2 as key during hypoxia and cancer cell metabolic adaptation. Protein-Protein Interactions and Quantitative Phosphoproteomic Analysis Reveal Potential Mitochondrial Substrates of Protein Phosphatase 2A-B'\u03b6 Holoenzyme. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a heterotrimeric conserved serine/threonine phosphatase complex that includes catalytic, scaffolding, and regulatory subunits. The 3 A subunits, 17\nand mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and is important for maintaining cellular and organismal glucose homeostasis. Phosphorylation of the PDC E1 subunit was identified as a key inhibitory modification in bovine tissue \u223c50 years ago, and this regulatory process is now known to be conserved throughout evolution. Although Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a pervasive model organism for investigating cellular metabolism and its regulation by signaling processes, the phosphatase(s) responsible for activating the PDC in S. cerevisiae has not been conclusively defined. Here, using comparative mitochondrial phosphoproteomics, analyses of protein-protein interactions by affinity enrichment-mass spectrometry, and in vitro biochemistry, we define Ptc6p as the primary PDC phosphatase in S. cerevisiae Our analyses further suggest additional substrates for related S. cerevisiae phosphatases and describe the overall phosphoproteomic changes that accompany mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction. In summary, our quantitative proteomics and biochemical analyses have identified Ptc6p as the primary-and likely sole-S. cerevisiae PDC phosphatase, closing a key\ngroup lipoate is essential to the activity of critical mitochondrial catabolic enzymes, its regulation is unknown. Here, we show that lipoylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase and \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (\u03b1KDH) complexes is a dynamically regulated process that is inhibited under hypoxia and in cancer cells to restrain mitochondrial respiration. Mechanistically, we found that the polymerase-\u03b4 interacting protein 2 (Poldip2), a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein of unknown function, controls the lipoylation of the pyruvate and \u03b1-KDH dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase subunits by a mechanism that involves regulation of the caseinolytic peptidase (Clp)-protease complex and degradation of the lipoate-activating enzyme Ac-CoA synthetase medium-chain family member 1 (ACSM1). ACSM1 is required for the utilization of lipoic acid derived from a salvage pathway, an unacknowledged lipoylation mechanism. In Poldip2-deficient cells, reduced lipoylation represses mitochondrial function and induces the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) by loss of substrate inhibition of prolyl-4-hydroxylases (PHDs). HIF-1\u03b1-mediated retrograde signaling results in a\n(PP2A) is a heterotrimeric conserved serine/threonine phosphatase complex that includes catalytic, scaffolding, and regulatory subunits. The 3 A subunits, 17 B subunits, and 5 C subunits that are encoded by the Arabidopsis genome allow 255 possible PP2A holoenzyme combinations. The regulatory subunits are crucial for substrate specificity and PP2A complex localization and are classified into the B, B', and B\" non-related families in land plants. In Arabidopsis, the close homologs B'\u03b7, B'\u03b8, B'\u03b3, and B'\u03b6 are further classified into a subfamily of B' called B'\u03b7. Previous studies have suggested that mitochondrial targeted PP2A subunits (B'\u03b6) play a role in energy metabolism and plant innate immunity. Potentially, the PP2A-B'\u03b6 holoenzyme is involved in the regulation of the mitochondrial succinate/fumarate translocator, and it may affect the enzymes involved in energy metabolism. To investigate this hypothesis, the interactions between PP2A-B'\u03b6 and the enzymes involved in the mitochondrial energy flow were investigated using bimolecular\ncomponent. Tissue-specific and metabolic state-specific control is achieved by the selective expression and distinct regulatory properties of at least four PDK isozymes and two PDP isozymes. The PDK isoforms are members of a family of serine kinases that are not structurally related to cytoplasmic Ser/Thr/Tyr kinases. The catalytic subunits of the PDP isoforms are Mg2+-dependent members of the phosphatase 2C family that has binuclear metal-binding sites within the active site. The dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) and the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase-binding protein (E3BP) are multidomain proteins that form the oligomeric core of the complex. One or more of their three lipoyl domains (two in E2) selectively bind each PDK and PDP1. These adaptive interactions predominantly influence the catalytic efficiencies and effector control of these regulatory enzymes. When fatty acids are the preferred source of acetyl-CoA and NADH, feedback inactivation of PDC is accomplished by the activity of certain kinase isoforms being stimulated upon\n173.2 \u00c5. The structure was solved by molecular-replacement methods and refined to a final R factor of 21.9% (Rfree = 24.7%). The final model consists of 402 of a possible 467 amino-acid residues of the PDP1c monomer, two Mn2+ ions in the active site, an additional Mn2+ ion coordinated by His410 and His414, two MnSO4 ion pairs at special positions near the crystallographic twofold symmetry axis and 226 water molecules. Several new features of the PDP1c structure are revealed. The requirements are described and plausible bases are deduced for the interaction of PDP1c with PDP1r and other components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Poldip2 is an oxygen-sensitive protein that controls PDH and \u03b1KGDH lipoylation and activation to support metabolic adaptation in hypoxia and cancer. Although the addition of the prosthetic group lipoate is essential to the activity of critical mitochondrial catabolic enzymes, its regulation is unknown. Here, we show that\nand alpha-helices. Consistent with the previous studies, two well-fixed magnesium ions are coordinated by five active site residues and five water molecules in the PDP1c catalytic center. Structural analysis indicates that, while the central portion of the PDP1c molecule is highly conserved among the members of the PPM protein family, a number of structural insertions and deletions located at the periphery of PDP1c likely define its functional specificity towards the PDC. One notable feature of PDP1c is a long insertion (residues 98-151) forming a unique hydrophobic pocket on the surface that likely accommodates the lipoyl moiety of the E2 domain in a fashion similar to that of PDHKs. The cavity, however, appears more open than in PDHK, suggesting that its closure may be required to achieve tight, specific binding of the lipoic acid. We propose a mechanism in which the closure of the lipoic acid binding site is triggered by\nof acetyl-CoA and NADH, feedback inactivation of PDC is accomplished by the activity of certain kinase isoforms being stimulated upon preferentially binding a lipoyl domain containing a reductively acetylated lipoyl group. PDC activity is increased in Ca2+-sensitive tissues by elevating PDP1 activity via the Ca2+-dependent binding of PDP1 to a lipoyl domain of E2. During starvation, the irrecoverable loss of glucose carbons is restricted by minimizing PDC activity due to high kinase activity that results from the overexpression of specific kinase isoforms. Overexpression of the same PDK isoforms deleteriously hinders glucose consumption in unregulated diabetes.",

The ability of dopamine receptors to interact with other receptor subtypes may provide mechanisms for modulating dopamine-related functions and behaviors. In particular, there is evidence suggesting that the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) affects the dopaminergic system by regulating the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons or by altering dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) responsiveness to ligands. TAAR1 is a G\u03b1(s) protein-coupled receptor that is activated by biogenic amines, \"trace amines,\" such as \u03b2-phenylethylamine (\u03b2-PEA) and tyramine that are normally found at low concentrations in the mammalian brain. In the present study, we investigated the biochemical mechanism of interaction between TAAR1 and D2R and the role this interaction plays in D2R-related signaling and behaviors. Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer biosensor for cAMP, we demonstrated that the D2R antagonists haloperidol, raclopride, and amisulpride were able to enhance selectively a TAAR1-mediated \u03b2-PEA\nspecies-specific differences between human and mouse TAAR1. Our study provides insights into the mechanism of ligand recognition and G-protein selectivity by TAAR1, which may help in the discovery of ligands or therapeutic strategies for neurological and metabolic disorders. Trace Amines and the Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1: Pharmacology, Neurochemistry, and Clinical Implications. Biogenic amines are a collection of endogenous molecules that play pivotal roles as neurotransmitters and hormones. In addition to the \"classical\" biogenic amines resulting from decarboxylation of aromatic acids, including dopamine (DA), norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin (5-HT), and histamine, other biogenic amines, present at much lower concentrations in the central nervous system (CNS), and hence referred to as \"trace\" amines (TAs), are now recognized to play significant neurophysiological and behavioral functions. At the turn of the century, the discovery of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a phylogenetically conserved G protein-coupled receptor that is responsive to both TAs, such as\ndysregulation, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, mood disorders, and addiction. Indeed, the recent development of novel pharmacological tools targeting TAAR1 has uncovered the remarkable potential of TAAR1-based medications as new generation pharmacotherapies in neuropsychiatry. This review summarizes recent developments in the study of TAs and TAAR1, their intricate neurochemistry and pharmacology, and their relevance for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease. Recognition of methamphetamine and other amines by trace amine receptor TAAR1. Trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), the founding member of a nine-member family of trace amine receptors, is responsible for recognizing a range of biogenic amines in the brain, including the endogenous \u03b2-phenylethylamine (\u03b2-PEA)1 as well as methamphetamine2, an abused substance that has posed a severe threat to human health and society3. Given its unique physiological role in the brain, TAAR1 is also an emerging target for a range of neurological disorders including schizophrenia, depression and drug addiction2,4,5. Here we report structures\nfor cAMP, we demonstrated that the D2R antagonists haloperidol, raclopride, and amisulpride were able to enhance selectively a TAAR1-mediated \u03b2-PEA increase of cAMP. Moreover, TAAR1 and D2R were able to form heterodimers when coexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and this direct interaction was disrupted in the presence of haloperidol. In addition, in mice lacking TAAR1, haloperidol-induced striatal c-Fos expression and catalepsy were significantly reduced. Taken together, these data suggest that TAAR1 and D2R have functional and physical interactions that could be critical for the modulation of the dopaminergic system by TAAR1 in vivo. Ligand recognition and G-protein coupling of trace amine receptor TAAR1. Trace-amine-associated receptors (TAARs), a group of biogenic amine receptors, have essential roles in neurological and metabolic homeostasis1. They recognize diverse endogenous trace amines and subsequently activate a range of G-protein-subtype signalling pathways2,3. Notably, TAAR1 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for treating psychiatric disorders4,5.\nthe trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a phylogenetically conserved G protein-coupled receptor that is responsive to both TAs, such as \u03b2-phenylethylamine, octopamine, and tyramine, and structurally-related amphetamines, unveiled mechanisms of action for TAs other than interference with aminergic pathways, laying the foundations for deciphering the functional significance of TAs and its mammalian CNS receptor, TAAR1. Although, its molecular interactions and downstream targets have not been fully elucidated, TAAR1 activation triggers accumulation of intracellular cAMP, modulates PKA and PKC signaling and interferes with the \u03b2-arrestin2-dependent pathway via G protein-independent mechanisms. TAAR1 is uniquely positioned to exert direct control over DA and 5-HT neuronal firing and release, which has profound implications for understanding the pathophysiology of, and therefore designing more efficacious therapeutic interventions for, a range of neuropsychiatric disorders that involve aminergic dysregulation, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, mood disorders, and addiction. Indeed, the recent development of novel pharmacological tools targeting TAAR1 has\nactivate a range of G-protein-subtype signalling pathways2,3. Notably, TAAR1 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for treating psychiatric disorders4,5. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its ability to recognize different ligands remain largely unclear. Here we present nine cryo-electron microscopy structures, with eight showing human and mouse TAAR1 in a complex with an array of ligands, including the endogenous 3-iodothyronamine, two antipsychotic agents, the psychoactive drug amphetamine and two identified catecholamine agonists, and one showing 5-HT1AR in a complex with an antipsychotic agent. These structures reveal a rigid consensus binding motif in TAAR1 that binds to endogenous trace amine stimuli and two extended binding pockets that accommodate diverse chemotypes. Combined with mutational analysis, functional assays and molecular dynamic simulations, we elucidate the structural basis of drug polypharmacology and identify the species-specific differences between human and mouse TAAR1. Our study provides insights into the mechanism of ligand recognition and G-protein selectivity\nalso an emerging target for a range of neurological disorders including schizophrenia, depression and drug addiction2,4,5. Here we report structures of human TAAR1-G-protein complexes bound to methamphetamine and \u03b2-PEA as well as complexes bound to RO5256390, a TAAR1-selective agonist, and SEP-363856, a clinical-stage dual agonist for TAAR1 and serotonin receptor 5-HT1AR (refs. 6,7). Together with systematic mutagenesis and functional studies, the structures reveal the molecular basis of methamphetamine recognition and underlying mechanisms of ligand selectivity and polypharmacology between TAAR1 and other monoamine receptors. We identify a lid-like extracellular loop 2 helix/loop structure and a hydrogen-bonding network in the ligand-binding pockets, which may contribute to the ligand recognition in TAAR1. These findings shed light on the ligand recognition mode and activation mechanism for TAAR1 and should guide the development of next-generation therapeutics for drug addiction and various neurological disorders.",

The discovery of small-molecule drugs aimed at disrupting protein-protein associations is expected to lead to promising therapeutic strategies. The small molecule binds to the target protein thus replacing its natural protein partner. Noteworthy, structural analysis of complexes between successful disruptive small molecules and their target proteins has suggested the possibility that such ligands might somehow mimic the binding behavior of the protein they replace. In these cases, the molecules show a spatial and \"chemical\" (i.e., hydrophobicity) similarity with the residues of the partner protein involved in the protein-protein complex interface. However, other disruptive small molecules do not seem to show such spatial and chemical correspondence with the replaced protein. In turn, recent progress in the understanding of protein-protein interactions and binding hot spots has revealed the main role of intermolecular wrapping interactions: three-body cooperative correlations in which nonpolar groups in\nRNA while maintaining correct endogenous gene expression. microRNAs play prominent direct roles in all developmental stages, adult physiology and lifespan. The other small RNA pathways act primarily in the germline, but their impact extends far beyond, into embryogenesis and adult physiology, and even to subsequent generations. Here, we review the mechanisms and developmental functions of the diverse small RNA pathways of C. elegans. ROSETTALIGAND: protein-small molecule docking with full side-chain flexibility. Protein-small molecule docking algorithms provide a means to model the structure of protein-small molecule complexes in structural detail and play an important role in drug development. In recent years the necessity of simulating protein side-chain flexibility for an accurate prediction of the protein-small molecule interfaces has become apparent, and an increasing number of docking algorithms probe different approaches to include protein flexibility. Here we describe a new method for docking small molecules into protein binding sites employing a Monte\nIn support of a deep connection between the mechanism of RNA splicing and small-RNA-mediated gene silencing, the presence of the Argonaute proteins and other small RNA components in the many species analysed strongly correlates with the number of introns in those species. Characterizing protein domain associations by Small-molecule ligand binding. BACKGROUND: Protein domains are evolutionarily conserved building blocks for protein structure and function, which are conventionally identified based on protein sequence or structure similarity. Small molecule binding domains are of great importance for the recognition of small molecules in biological systems and drug development. Many small molecules, including drugs, have been increasingly identified to bind to multiple targets, leading to promiscuous interactions with protein domains. Thus, a large scale characterization of the protein domains and their associations with respect to small-molecule binding is of particular interest to system biology research, drug target identification, as well as drug repurposing.METHODS: We compiled\ninclude protein flexibility. Here we describe a new method for docking small molecules into protein binding sites employing a Monte Carlo minimization procedure in which the rigid body position and orientation of the small molecule and the protein side-chain conformations are optimized simultaneously. The energy function comprises van der Waals (VDW) interactions, an implicit solvation model, an explicit orientation hydrogen bonding potential, and an electrostatics model. In an evaluation of the scoring function the computed energy correlated with experimental small molecule binding energy with a correlation coefficient of 0.63 across a diverse set of 229 protein- small molecule complexes. The docking method produced lowest energy models with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) smaller than 2 A in 71 out of 100 protein-small molecule crystal structure complexes (self-docking). In cross-docking calculations in which both protein side-chain and small molecule internal degrees of freedom were varied the lowest energy predictions had\nsmall protein models exposes 178,745 putative protein-protein interactions with the remaining gene products in the mouse proteome, 1,100 potential binding sites for small organic molecules and 987 metal-binding signatures.CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly indicate that many small proteins adopt three-dimensional structures and are fully functional, playing important roles in transcriptional regulation, cell signaling and metabolism.

Bacterial Small Membrane Proteins: the Swiss Army Knife of Regulators at the Lipid Bilayer. Small membrane proteins represent a subset of recently discovered small proteins (\u2264100 amino acids), which are a ubiquitous class of emerging regulators underlying bacterial adaptation to environmental stressors. Until relatively recently, small open reading frames encoding these proteins were not designated genes in genome annotations. Therefore, our understanding of small protein biology was primarily limited\nas transport, signal transduction, stress response, respiration, cell division, sporulation, and membrane stability. Thus, small membrane proteins represent a versatile group of physiology regulators at the membrane and the whole cell. Additionally, small membrane proteins have the potential for clinical applications, where some of the proteins may act as antibacterial agents themselves while others serve as alternative drug targets for the development of novel antimicrobials. Domain-based small molecule binding site annotation Background Accurate small molecule binding site information for a protein can facilitate studies in drug docking, drug discovery and function prediction, but small molecule binding site protein sequence annotation is sparse. The Small Molecule Interaction Database (SMID), a database of protein domain-small molecule interactions, was created using structural data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). More importantly it provides a means to predict small molecule binding sites on proteins with a known or unknown structure and unlike prior approaches,\nsmall-molecule binding is of particular interest to system biology research, drug target identification, as well as drug repurposing.METHODS: We compiled a collection of 13,822 physical interactions of small molecules and protein domains derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures. Based on the chemical similarity of these small molecules, we characterized pairwise associations of the protein domains and further investigated their global associations from a network point of view.RESULTS: We found that protein domains, despite lack of similarity in sequence and structure, were comprehensively associated through binding the same or similar small-molecule ligands. Moreover, we identified modules in the domain network that consisted of closely related protein domains by sharing similar biochemical mechanisms, being involved in relevant biological pathways, or being regulated by the same cognate cofactors.CONCLUSIONS: A novel protein domain relationship was identified in the context of small-molecule binding, which is complementary to those identified by traditional sequence-based or\nof the AMBER software package. Exploring the \"dark matter\" of a mammalian proteome by protein structure and function modeling. BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence shows that gene products encoded by short open reading frames play key roles in numerous cellular processes. Yet, they are generally overlooked in genome assembly, escaping annotation because small protein-coding genes are difficult to predict computationally. Consequently, there are still a considerable number of small proteins whose functions are yet to be characterized.RESULTS: To address this issue, we apply a collection of structural bioinformatics algorithms to infer molecular function of putative small proteins from the mouse proteome. Specifically, we construct 1,743 confident structure models of small proteins, which reveal a significant structural diversity with a noticeably high helical content. A subsequent structure-based function annotation of small protein models exposes 178,745 putative protein-protein interactions with the remaining gene products in the mouse proteome, 1,100 potential binding\nproducing a structural subset of the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND) called the molecular modeling database BIND (MMDBBIND). From this initial structural interaction set, protein domains were identified that associate with one or more small molecules. SMID presents a unified interface to view detailed small molecule binding sites within conserved families and functional domains while also making available a more detailed view of the underlying protein-small molecule binding sites. The additional layer of abstraction from protein to domain enables SMID to group together all the similar interactions involving a particular domain for easy comparison. Additionally, we present SMID-BLAST, a tool for small molecule and binding site annotation and prediction. SMID-BLAST acts in a similar manner to in silico high throughput screening, yet instead of only searching through a library of small molecules, it uses the structural information in the PDB to extrapolate known small molecule interactions to a protein of\nan extremely useful extrapolation of the small molecule interaction information implicitly stored in the PDB database. By generalizing from protein-ligand interactions to domain-ligand interactions, SMID is able to cluster similar interactions and detect subtle binding patterns that would not otherwise be obvious. Using SMID-BLAST, likely small molecule targets can be predicted for an arbitrary protein sequence, with the only limitation being that the small molecule must exist in the PDB in order to be predicted. There are presently over 5000 unique small molecules represented in the PDB, many being drug-like molecules, and so SMID-BLAST could be used at least as a starting point to suggest what small molecules may bind to a protein of interest. More importantly, SMID-BLAST can suggest where specific small molecules are likely to bind the protein. The SMID-BLAST validation results, coupled with the specific examples listed in the results section, illustrate that SMID-BLAST has a high\nand screening of libraries based on natural product templates: a comprehensive survey Generating diverse skeletons of small molecules combinatorially Target-oriented and diversity-oriented organic synthesis in drug discovery High throughput screening for protein kinase inhibitors The role of in vitro ADME assays in antimalarial drug discovery and development Applying combinatorial chemistry and biology to food research Integration of virtual and high-throughput screening Selected concepts and investigations in compound classification, molecular descriptor analysis, and virtual screening The Catalytic Site Atlas: a resource of catalytic sites and residues identified in enzymes using structural data Het-PDB Navi.: a database for protein-small molecule interactions Distilling the essential features of a protein surface for improving protein-ligand docking, scoring, and virtual screening eF-site and PDBjViewer: database and viewer for protein functional sites Ligand-protein inverse docking and its potential use in the computer search of protein targets of a small molecule The Protein Data Bank The Pfam protein\nbinding hot spots has revealed the main role of intermolecular wrapping interactions: three-body cooperative correlations in which nonpolar groups in the partner protein promote dehydration of a two-body electrostatic interaction of the other protein. Hence, in the present work, we study some successful complexes between already discovered small disruptive drug-like molecules and their target proteins already reported in the literature and we compare them with the complexes between such proteins and their natural protein partners. Our results show that the small molecules do in fact mimic to a great extent the wrapping behavior of the protein they replace. Thus, by revealing the replacement the small molecule performs of relevant wrapping interactions, we convey precise physical meaning to the mimicking concept, a knowledge that might be exploited in future drug-design endeavors. The small heat shock proteins and their clients. Small heat shock proteins are ubiquitous proteins found throughout all kingdoms. One\nlimitation being that the small molecule must exist in the PDB. Validation results and specific examples within illustrate that SMID-BLAST has a high degree of accuracy in terms of predicting both the small molecule ligand and binding site residue positions for a query protein. Background Finding a protein sequence with small molecule binding site annotation can be a challenge as these are not consistently well annotated in existing sequence databases, regardless as to the degree of sequence similarity to proteins of known structure with well characterized small molecule binding sites. When annotation does exist, it may come from one of three places: directly from experiment, through mapping to a protein family known to bind certain molecules, or through homology to a crystal structure demonstrating small molecule binding. Experimentally, small molecule ligands for proteins are often identified using high-throughput screening methods with chemical libraries. Such libraries may be developed in either\na means to predict small molecule binding sites on proteins with a known or unknown structure and unlike prior approaches, removes large numbers of false positive hits arising from transitive alignment errors, non-biologically significant small molecules and crystallographic conditions that overpredict ion binding sites. Description Using a set of co-crystallized protein-small molecule structures as a starting point, SMID interactions were generated by identifying protein domains that bind to small molecules, using NCBI's Reverse Position Specific BLAST (RPS-BLAST) algorithm. SMID records are available for viewing at . The SMID-BLAST tool provides accurate transitive annotation of small-molecule binding sites for proteins not found in the PDB. Given a protein sequence, SMID-BLAST identifies domains using RPS-BLAST and then lists potential small molecule ligands based on SMID records, as well as their aligned binding sites. A heuristic ligand score is calculated based on E-value, ligand residue identity and domain entropy to assign a level\nproteins and can serve to direct experimentation. We hope that in the future SMID will serve as a useful resource for interaction prediction, and annotation of new protein sequences. Construction and content MMDBBIND database The source for SMID was the small molecule division (3DSM) of MMDBBIND, a database of high quality protein-small molecule interactions generated from NCBI's MMDB. The MMDB currently houses over 27,000 molecular structures from the PDB. Protein-small molecule interactions were identified using an interatomic distance cutoff of the van der Waals radii plus 0.5\u00c5. For most atom types this results in a distance cutoff of 3.5\u20134.0\u00c5, typical for a hydrogen bond. A subsequent filtering process identifies and tags those interactions in MMDBBIND which involve i) a single atomic contact ii) a protein with an unknown sequence (i.e. only alpha carbon trace is present in the structure) iii) a biologically irrelevant small molecule (see below) iv) one or\nusers to identify putative small-molecule binding sites in proteins for which a crystal-structure has not yet been determined, the SMID interface includes the SMID-BLAST web tool. SMID-BLAST executes NCBI's RPS-BLAST algorithm on a query protein sequence, identifying structural domains from CDD that have small molecules bound, as found in SMID. A SMID-BLAST query may take the form of an amino acid FASTA formatted sequence, protein GI, accession from any common sequence database or PDB chain. As with RPS-BLAST, the user can configure the Expect value cutoff, search mode and use of a low complexity filter. In addition, the user is able filter out SMID interactions involving non-biological ion contacts or non-biological small molecules, as detailed in Methods. SMID-BLAST hits are represented as a gapped local alignment between the query protein and a CDD domain with small-molecule binding sites mapped to the query from all small molecule interactions in SMID involving\nmay be used to provide automated annotation on newly sequenced genomes and sequences of unknown function, as small molecule binding can often imply function. We demonstrate through several examples how SMID-BLAST may be used to identify candidate small molecule binding sites on a query sequence of interest that are not found or difficult to identify using similar existing methods, and deduce protein function and evolutionary relationships. Utility and discussion SMID User Interface The SMID interface is written in PHP and provides a layer between user queries and the MySQL data tables. SMID may be queried by supplying either a protein GI (of a sequence in PDB), domain identifier, small molecule identifier, PDB ID or SMID ID. All successful queries to SMID return links to individual SMID records. Records contain information pertaining to the protein, domain and small molecule involved in the specific interaction. Interactions involving non-biological contacts with an ion\nconfidence that a particular CDD domain (e.g. Asparaginase), exists in a PDB protein. The bottom section of a SMID record describes the location of both the CDD domain and the small molecule binding residues in the parent PDB protein sequence from which the record is derived. This is depicted both numerically and graphically. For the latter, the PDB protein sequence is provided with domain residues in bold and binding site residues in red. Finally, the fraction of small molecule binding site residues found within the domain region is provided, as sometimes ligand residues lie outside the range of the CDD domain definition. Querying SMID using either domain or small-molecule designations provides the option of viewing either a non-redundant or redundant set of records. Redundant SMID records are clustered according to the rules outlined in Methods. Searching with either a PDB protein GI or domain identifier designation returns a listing of\nwith their PDB short labels. Purple molecules associate with the N-terminal domain of 2BIF chain A, while blue molecules associate with the C-temrinal domain. Note that BOG was part of the crystallization buffer in this example.

The process of 'Interaction Tagging' involves the identification of protein-small molecule interactions that involve i) single atom contacts ii) an unknown protein sequence iii) a biologically irrelevant small molecule iv) false contacts with biologically relevant ions using a Support Vector Machine. See text for details. SMID-BLAST hits for Burkholderia pseudomallei K96243 tRNA thiotransferase. For clarity, only small molecule hits with a final ligand score above the cutoff value of 50 are included. Molecule 3-letter names were obtained from PDBSum [71]. Molecule Identifier Binding Site Residues On Query Final Ligand Score\nencoding these proteins were not designated genes in genome annotations. Therefore, our understanding of small protein biology was primarily limited to a few candidates associated with previously characterized larger partner proteins. Following the first systematic analyses of small proteins in Escherichia coli over a decade ago, numerous small proteins across different bacteria have been uncovered. An estimated one-third of these newly discovered proteins in E. coli are localized to the cell membrane, where they may interact with distinct groups of membrane proteins, such as signal receptors, transporters, and enzymes, and affect their activities. Recently, there has been considerable progress in functionally characterizing small membrane protein regulators aided by innovative tools adapted specifically to study small proteins. Our review covers prototypical proteins that modulate a broad range of cellular processes, such as transport, signal transduction, stress response, respiration, cell division, sporulation, and membrane stability. Thus, small membrane proteins represent a versatile",

A non-characterized protein detected by the antibody (N) can be used as loading control.

A phosphatidylinositol-phosphate affinity chromatographic approach combined with mass spectrometry was used in order to identify novel PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2 binding proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana suspension cell extracts. Most of the phosphatidylinositol-phosphate interacting candidates identified from this differential screening are characterized by lysine/arginine rich patches. Direct phosphoinositide binding was identified for important membrane trafficking regulators as well as protein quality control proteins such as the ATG18p orthologue involved in autophagosome formation and the lipid Sec14p like transfer protein. A pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) containing protein was shown to directly bind to PI(3,5)P2 but not to PI(3)P. PIP chromatography performed using extracts obtained from high salt (0.4M and 1M NaCl) pretreated suspensions showed that the association of an S5-1 40S ribosomal protein with both PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2 was abolished under salt stress whereas salinity stress\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae contain two different forms in each acidic protein family, \u03b1 and \u03b2, which are found in the ribosome also forming a P0-(P1\u03b1/P2\u03b2)(P1\u03b2/P2\u03b1) pentamer. A notable dynamism is one of most significant features of the eukaryotic stalk. Thus, in contrast to the stability of the prokaryotic L10\u2013L7/12 interaction, the eukaryotic complex is easily disassembled. Moreover, the ribosome-bound P1 and P2 proteins are exchanged with the free acidic proteins present in a large cytoplasmic pool and this process, which implies changes in the P1/P2 affinity for the ribosome, is increased during protein synthesis. This stalk dynamism results in the presence of diverse ribosome subpopulations containing different amounts of P1/P2 proteins. The absence of P1/P2 reduces the ribosome translating efficiency to a different extent depending on the translated messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and some proteins are expressed at a higher rate by the defective ribosomes. Therefore, the overall cellular pattern of protein\n(Figure 2C) indicate that the presence of the protein P1\u03b2, absent in the D56 cells, facilitates the association of the defective proteins to the ribosome. Protein P1\u03b2 can form P1\u03b2/P2\u03b1 heterodimers that allow the assembly of a complete (P1\u03b1/P2\u03b2)\u2013P0\u2013(P1\u03b2/P2\u03b1) pentamer, which is missing in strain D56 and seems to stabilize the binding of the defective mutant P2\u03b2\u2013P1\u03b1 couples. These results support that the two heterodimers forming the ribosomal stalk are not independent as has been proposed for the human ribosomes. Role of heterodimers in pentamer assembly As commented on previously, P1 and P2 are able to form heterodimers in solution, and it is assumed that their interaction with the ribosome takes place in the associated state. If this is so, there must be a direct relationship between the protein capacity to form heterodimers and to bind to the ribosome. In general, our results are in agreement with this statement but\nSolution structure of human P1\u2022P2 heterodimer provides insights into the role of eukaryotic stalk in recruiting the ribosome-inactivating protein trichosanthin to the ribosome. Lateral ribosomal stalk is responsible for binding and recruiting translation factors during protein synthesis. The eukaryotic stalk consists of one P0 protein with two copies of P1\u2022P2 heterodimers to form a P0(P1\u2022P2)\u2082 pentameric P-complex. Here, we have solved the structure of full-length P1\u2022P2 by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. P1 and P2 dimerize via their helical N-terminal domains, whereas the C-terminal tails of P1\u2022P2 are unstructured and can extend up to \u223c125 \u00c5 away from the dimerization domains. (15)N relaxation study reveals that the C-terminal tails are flexible, having a much faster internal mobility than the N-terminal domains. Replacement of prokaryotic L10(L7/L12)\u2084/L11 by eukaryotic P0(P1\u2022P2)\u2082/eL12 rendered Escherichia coli ribosome, which is insensitive to trichosanthin (TCS), susceptible to depurination by TCS and the C-terminal tail was found to be\nbe an absolute requirement for stalk assembly. Homology modeling of the protein complexes suggests that the mutated residues can affect the overall protein conformation. INTRODUCTION The stalk is a lateral protuberance of the large ribosomal subunit involved in the interaction and function of several soluble factors during translation. The ribosomal stalk is formed by a complex of a ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-binding protein, the prokaryotic L10 and the eukaryotic P0, and a set of acidic proteins called L7/L12 in prokaryotes and P1/P2 in eukaryotes. Protein L7/L12 binds as a homodimer to L10 forming either a pentameric L10-(L7/L12)2 or a heptameric L10\u2013(L7/L12)3 complex depending on the organism. In higher eukaryotes there are two acidic protein families, P1 and P2, which interact with protein P0 as P1/P2 heterodimers to form a P0\u2013(P1/P2)2 pentamer. Saccharomyces cerevisiae contain two different forms in each acidic protein family, \u03b1 and \u03b2, which are found in the ribosome\nand dynamics of the ribosomal protein P0 and its related trans-acting factor Mrt4 during ribosome assembly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Erythrocytic stage-dependent regulation of oligomerization of Plasmodium ribosomal protein P2. The eukaryotic 60 S-ribosomal stalk consists of P0, P1, and P2 proteins, which associate in a pentameric structure (P1(2)-P0-P2(2)). The Plasmodium falciparum protein P2 (PfP2) appears to play nonribosomal roles. It gets exported to the infected erythrocyte (IE) surface at 30 h post-merozoite invasion (PMI), concomitant with extensive oligomerization. Here we present certain biophysical properties of PfP2. Recombinant P2 (rPfP2) protein showed SDS-resistant oligomerization, which could be significantly abolished under reducing conditions. However, the protein continued to oligomerize even when both cysteine residues were mutated, and with up to 40 amino acids (aa) deleted from the C-terminal end. CD analysis of P2 showed largely \u03b1-helical and random coil domains. The SDS- and DTT-resistant oligomerization was studied further as it occurred in\nloop. Due to subtle differences in the structure of maize RIP, hydrophobic interaction with the \u2018FGLFD\u2019 motif of P2 is not as evidenced in MOD-P2 interaction. As a result, interaction of P2 with MOD was weaker than those with trichosanthin and shiga toxin A as reflected by the dissociation constants (KD) of their interaction, which are 1037.50\u00b165.75 \u00b5M, 611.70\u00b128.13 \u00b5M and 194.84\u00b19.47 \u00b5M respectively. Despite MOD and TCS target at the same ribosomal protein P2, MOD was found 48 and 10 folds less potent than trichosanthin in ribosome depurination and cytotoxicity to 293T cells respectively, implicating the strength of interaction between RIPs and ribosomal proteins is important for the biological activity of RIPs. Our work illustrates the flexibility on the docking of RIPs on ribosomal proteins for targeting the sarcin-ricin loop and the importance of protein-protein interaction for ribosome-inactivating activity. Introduction Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) comprise more than one hundred N-glycosidases\nP1 and P2, together with P0 and eL12, were required to activate ribosomes in polyphenylalanine synthesis dependent on eucaryotic elongation factors as well as eEF-2-dependent GTPase activity. The results suggest that formation of the P1-P2 heterodimer is required for subsequent formation of the P0(P1-P2)2 complex and its functional rRNA binding in silkworm ribosomes. Maize Ribosome-Inactivating Protein Uses Lys158\u2013Lys161 to Interact with Ribosomal Protein P2 and the Strength of Interaction Is Correlated to the Biological Activities Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) inactivate prokaryotic or eukaryotic ribosomes by removing a single adenine in the large ribosomal RNA. Here we show maize RIP (MOD), an atypical RIP with an internal inactivation loop, interacts with the ribosomal stalk protein P2 via Lys158\u2013Lys161, which is located in the N-terminal domain and at the base of its internal loop. Due to subtle differences in the structure of maize RIP, hydrophobic interaction with the \u2018FGLFD\u2019 motif of P2 is\nP2 half-life, and suggest different degradation mechanisms for each protein type. Moreover, the capacity to form P1/P2 heterodimers is drastically affected by mutations in the P2\u03b2 four initial amino acids, while these mutations have no effect on P1\u03b2. Binding of P2\u03b2 and, to a lesser extent, P1\u03b2 to the ribosome is also seriously affected showing the high relevance of the amino acids in the first turn of the NTD \u03b1-helix 1 for the stalk assembly. The negative effect of some mutations on ribosome binding can be reversed by the presence of the second P1/P2 couple in the ribosome, indicating a stabilizing structural influence between the two heterodimers. Unexpectedly, some mutations totally abolish heterodimer formation but allow significant ribosome binding and, therefore, a previous P1 and P2 association seems not to be an absolute requirement for stalk assembly. Homology modeling of the protein complexes suggests that the mutated residues can affect\nprotein, and the ribosomal stalk protein P2 by chemical shift perturbation and mutagenesis analyses The catalytic subunit of shiga-like toxin 1 interacts with ribosomal stalk proteins and is inhibited by their conserved C-terminal domain Charged and hydrophobic surfaces on the A chain of shiga-like toxin 1 recognize the C-terminal domain of ribosomal stalk proteins Ricin A chain can be chemically cross-linked to the mammalian ribosomal proteins L9 and L10e Pokeweed antiviral protein accesses ribosomes by binding to L3 Active center cleft residues of pokeweed antiviral protein mediate its high-affinity binding to the ribosomal protein L3 The C-terminal end of P proteins mediates ribosome inactivation by trichosanthin but does not affect the pokeweed antiviral protein activity The ribosomal stalk is required for ribosome binding, depurination of the rRNA and cytotoxicity of ricin A chain in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Shiga toxin 1 is more dependent on the P proteins of the ribosomal stalk\nin plants, fungi and bacteria Ribosome-inactivating proteins Ribosome-inactivating proteins: progress and problems The sarcin-ricin loop of 23S rRNA is essential for assembly of the functional core of the 50S ribosomal subunit Inhibition by ricin of protein synthesis in vitro.

In contrast, modification of positions 2 and 4 in P1\u03b2 does not affect protein binding to the ribosome and apparently does not contribute much to the stability of the complex. Actually, in the modeled pentamer structure the first three residues of the protein are apparently not included in \u03b1-helix 1 (Supplementary Figure S5). A more extensive modification including the first five residues, which in this case affects helix 1 (Figure 5C), abolishes the protein capacity to bind to the ribosome. It seems, therefore, that as in the heterodimer formation, the initial amino acids of P1 and P2 proteins are not equally relevant. The differences found in ribosome binding of P2\u03b2 mutants in S. cerevisiae D5 and D56 (Figure 2C) indicate that the presence of the protein P1\u03b2, absent in the D56 cells, facilitates the association of the\nribosome as well as to locate their target. As proposed earlier, the interaction between RTA and ribosome can be characterized by a two-step binding model, consisting of a faster and stronger interaction involving particular ribosomal protein(s) and a slower and weaker interaction between the ribosomal surface and RIPs which may involves multiple binding sites on a single ribosome. Ribosomal protein is believed to facilitate the depurinating activity of RIPs by guiding them to the SRL. Unable to bind to a target ribosomal protein(s) would inevitably compromise the interaction with ribosome as well as the activity of RIPs. In the case of maize RIP, the P2-binding site on maize RIP was located at Lys158\u2013Lys161, which is not at the C-terminus as in other RIPs, and their mutation severely compromised the interaction with ribosome. Our findings show the crucial role of electrostatic interaction in RIP-ribosome interaction and highlight the importance of interacting\nthrough a different route that does not require any P-protein. Recently, we have also solved the crystal and solution structures of maize RIP. Maize RIP is an atypical RIP that contains a 25-amino acid internal peptide in the precursor form (pro-RIP). The internal peptide is absent in most RIPs and represses the activity of maize RIP by at least 600 folds and pro-RIP displays a lower affinity to rat liver ribosome in comparison to the active form. We postulated the internal peptide creates a steric hindrance causing a crash between the protein and rRNA, thereby prohibiting the protein to inactivate the ribosome and reducing its activity. By chemical shift perturbation NMR experiment, we have shown that amino acid residues at the N-terminal domain of MOD, the active form of maize RIP, are perturbed upon the addition of ribosomal protein P2. In this report, we demonstrate that among all the positively\ncontains their respective protein partner, P2\u03b1 and P1\u03b1, and the ribosome bound stalk components were analyzed by isoelectrofocusing. The S2F and S2K,S4L mutations in P1\u03b2F2 and P1\u03b2K2L4 had no detectable effect on the amount of ribosome-bound protein, and it had previously been found that a single S4R mutation did not affect binding to the ribosome either. In contrast, protein P1\u03b25ntP2\u03b2 was not detected in the particles (Figure 2A). In the P2\u03b2 series, introduction of a Ser at position 2 resulted in a duplication of the mutated protein bands, which correspond to different N-terminal processed forms of the protein (Table 1 and Supplementary Data). The K2S mutation had a limited effect on the protein ribosome-binding capacity. In contrast, the protein in the ribosome was notably affected by mutating position 3 or by a double mutation in two out of the three analyzed amino acids, and was totally abolished by changing the",

This work further supports the notion that ILK1 is an atypical kinase with an unusual cofactor dependence that may interact with multiple proteins in the cell. Phosphorylation of ARF2 Relieves Its Repression of Transcription of the K+ Transporter Gene HAK5 in Response to Low Potassium Stress. Potassium (K+) plays crucial roles in plant growth and development. In natural environments, K+ availability in soils is relatively low and fluctuating. Transcriptional regulation of K+ transporter genes is one of the most important mechanisms in the plant's response to K+ deficiency. In this study, we demonstrated that the transcription factor ARF2 (Auxin Response Factor 2) modulates the expression of the K+ transporter gene HAK5 (High Affinity K+ transporter 5) in Arabidopsis thaliana The arf2 mutant plants showed a\nenhanced under K+ deficient conditions. The presented results demonstrate that ARF2 plays important roles in the response to external K+ supply in Arabidopsis and regulates HAK5 transcription accordingly. Fine mapping and candidate gene analysis of qRN5a, a novel QTL promoting root number in rice under low potassium. KEY MESSAGE: qRN5a, a novel QTL for increasing root number under low K in rice, was fine mapped to a 48.8-kb region on chromosome 5, and LOC_Os05g27980 is the most likely candidate gene. Potassium (K) is a mineral nutrient essential for plant growth and development, but the molecular mechanism for low-K (LK) tolerance in rice remains poorly understood. In our previous study, the quantitative trait locus (QTL) qRN5a for root number (RN) under LK was identified in the chromosome segment substitution line CSSL35 carrying segments from XieqingzaoB in the genetic background of Zhonghui9308 (ZH9308). CSSL35 developed more roots than ZH9308 under LK at\noxidases RBOHC, RBOHD, and RBOHF. The resulting ROS signals simultaneously convey HAK5 K+ uptake-transporter induction and accelerated Casparian strip maturation. Collectively, these mechanisms synchronize developmental differentiation and transcriptome reprogramming for maintaining K+ homeostasis and optimizing nutrient foraging by roots. Back From the Dead: The Atypical Kinase Activity of a Pseudokinase Regulator of Cation Fluxes During Inducible Immunity. Pseudokinases are thought to lack phosphotransfer activity due to altered canonical catalytic residues within their kinase domain. However, a subset of pseudokinases maintain activity through atypical phosphotransfer mechanisms. The Arabidopsis ILK1 is a pseudokinase from the Raf-like MAP3K family and is the only known plant pseudokinase with confirmed protein kinase activity. ILK1 activity promotes disease resistance and molecular pattern-induced root growth inhibition through its stabilization of the HAK5 potassium transporter with the calmodulin-like protein CML9. ILK1 also has a kinase-independent function in salt stress suggesting that it interacts with additional proteins. We determined\nof the K+ transporter gene HAK5 (High Affinity K+ transporter 5) in Arabidopsis thaliana The arf2 mutant plants showed a tolerant phenotype similar to the HAK5-overexpressing lines on low-K+ medium, whose primary root lengths were longer than those of wild-type plants. High-affinity K+ uptake was significantly increased in these plants. ARF2-overexpressing lines and the hak5 mutant were both sensitive to low-K+ stress. Disruption of HAK5 in the arf2 mutant abolished the low-K+-tolerant phenotype of arf2 As a transcriptional repressor, ARF2 directly bound to the HAK5 promoter and repressed HAK5 expression under K+ sufficient conditions. ARF2 can be phosphorylated after low-K+ treatment, which abolished its DNA binding activity to the HAK5 promoter and relieved the inhibition on HAK5 transcription. Therefore, HAK5 transcript could be induced, and HAK5-mediated high-affinity K+ uptake was enhanced under K+ deficient conditions. The presented results demonstrate that ARF2 plays important roles in the response to external K+\nbetween plant defense pathways and K(+) homeostasis. A potassium-sensing niche in Arabidopsis roots orchestrates signaling and adaptation responses to maintain nutrient homeostasis. Organismal homeostasis of the essential ion K+ requires sensing of its availability, efficient uptake, and defined distribution. Understanding plant K+ nutrition is essential to advance sustainable agriculture, but the mechanisms underlying K+ sensing and the orchestration of downstream responses have remained largely elusive. Here, we report where plants sense K+ deprivation and how this translates into spatially defined ROS signals to govern specific downstream responses. We define the organ-scale K+ pattern of roots and identify a postmeristematic K+-sensing niche (KSN) where rapid K+ decline and Ca2+ signals coincide. Moreover, we outline a bifurcating low-K+-signaling axis of CIF peptide-activated SGN3-LKS4/SGN1 receptor complexes that convey low-K+-triggered phosphorylation of the NADPH oxidases RBOHC, RBOHD, and RBOHF. The resulting ROS signals simultaneously convey HAK5 K+ uptake-transporter induction and accelerated Casparian strip maturation.\nbetween OsABT overexpression lines and WT plants were enriched in plant hormone signal transduction, including ABA signaling pathway under salt stress. Thus, OsABT can improve the salt tolerance in rice seedling roots by inhibiting reactive oxygen species accumulation, thereby regulating the intracellular Na+/K+ balance, ABA content, and ABA signaling pathway. Arabidopsis K+ transporter HAK5-mediated high-affinity root K+ uptake is regulated by protein kinases CIPK1 and CIPK9. The high-affinity K+ transporter HAK5 is the major contributor to root K+ uptake from dilute solutions in K+-starved Arabidopsis plants. Its functionality is tightly regulated and its activity is enhanced under K+ starvation by the transcriptional induction of the AtHAK5 gene, and by the activation of the transporter via the AtCBL1-AtCIPK23 complex. In the present study, the 26 members of the Arabidopsis CIPK protein kinase family were screened in yeast for their capacity to activate HAK5-mediated K+ uptake. Among them, AtCIPK1 was the most\ncandidate gene for qRN5a. Moreover, we found that qRN5a promotes expression of OsIAA23 and represses OsHAK5 expression in root tissues to promote root initiation in CSSL35 under LK conditions. Additional investigations on OsHAK5 in rice are needed to elucidate the basis of changing root architecture under different K+ concentrations. qRN5a is useful for marker-assisted selection to develop an ideotype with improved root architecture in rice under K deficiency. OsABT Is Involved in Abscisic Acid Signaling Pathway and Salt Tolerance of Roots at the Rice Seedling Stage. Rice is a staple cereal crop worldwide, and increasing its yields is vital to ensuring global food security. Salinity is a major factor that affects rice yield. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate salt tolerance mechanisms in rice. Proteins containing WD40 repeats play important roles in eukaryotic development and environmental adaptation. Here, we showed that overexpression of OsABT, a gene encoding a WD40-repeat protein,\n(CIPK23), activated HAK5 in vivo. This activation produced an increase in the affinity and the Vmax of K(+) transport. In vitro experiments show that the N terminus of HAK5 is phosphorylated by CIPK23. This supports the idea that phosphorylation of HAK5 induces a conformational change that increases its affinity for K(+). Experiments of K(+) (Rb(+)) uptake and growth measurements in low-K(+) medium with Arabidopsis single mutants hak5, akt1, and cipk23, double mutants hak5 akt1, hak5 cipk23, and akt1 cipk23, and the triple mutant hak5 akt1 cipk23 confirmed the regulatory role of CIPK23 in planta. Insights into the mechanisms of transport and regulation of the arabidopsis high-affinity K+ transporter HAK51. The high-affinity K+ transporter HAK5 from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) is essential for K+ acquisition and plant growth at low micromolar K+ concentrations. Despite its functional relevance in plant nutrition, information about functional domains of HAK5 is scarce. Its activity is enhanced\nkinase family were screened in yeast for their capacity to activate HAK5-mediated K+ uptake. Among them, AtCIPK1 was the most efficient activator of AtHAK5. In addition, AtCIPK9, previously reported to participate in K+ homeostasis, also activated the transporter. In roots, the genes encoding AtCIPK1 and AtCIPK9 were induced by K+ deprivation and atcipk1 and atcipk9 Arabidopsis KO mutants showed a reduced AtHAK5-mediated Rb+ uptake. Activation of AtHAK5 by AtCIPK1 did not occur under hyperosmotic stress conditions, where AtCIPK1 function has been shown to be required to maintain plant growth. Taken together, our data contribute to the identification of the complex regulatory networks that control the high-affinity K+ transporter AtHAK5 and root K+ uptake. Comparison between Arabidopsis and Rice for Main Pathways of K(+) and Na(+) Uptake by Roots. K(+) is an essential macronutrient for plants. It is acquired by specific uptake systems located in roots. Although the concentrations of K(+)\nroles in eukaryotic development and environmental adaptation. Here, we showed that overexpression of OsABT, a gene encoding a WD40-repeat protein, enhanced salt tolerance in rice seedlings by regulating root activity, relative conductivity, malondialdehyde and H2O2 content, and O2\u2022- production rate. Root ion concentrations indicated that OsABT overexpression lines could maintain lower Na+ and higher K+/Na+ ratios and upregulated expression of salt-related genes OsSOS1 and OsHAK5 compared with the wild-type (WT) Nipponbare plants. Furthermore, Overexpression of OsABT decreased the abscisic acid (ABA) content, while downregulating the ABA synthesis genes OsNCED3 and OsNCED4 and upregulating the ABA catabolic gene OsABA8ox2. The yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analyses showed that OsABT interacted with the ABA receptor proteins OsPYL4, OsPYL10, and PP2C phosphatase OsABIL2. A transcriptome analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes between OsABT overexpression lines and WT plants were enriched in plant hormone signal transduction, including ABA signaling pathway under salt\nkinase activity revealed that ILK1 contributes to plant defense to bacterial pathogens, osmotic stress sensitivity, and cellular responses and total ion accumulation in the plant upon treatment with a bacterial-derived PAMP, flg22. The calmodulin-like protein CML9, a negative modulator of flg22-triggered immunity, interacted with, and suppressed ILK1 kinase activity. ILK1 interacted with and promoted the accumulation of HAK5, a putative (H(+))/K(+) symporter that mediates a high-affinity uptake during K(+) deficiency. ILK1 or HAK5 expression was required for several flg22 responses including gene induction, growth arrest, and plasma membrane depolarization. Furthermore, flg22 treatment induced a rapid K(+) efflux at both the plant and cellular levels in wild type, while mutants with impaired ILK1 or HAK5 expression exhibited a comparatively increased K(+) loss. Taken together, our results position ILK1 as a link between plant defense pathways and K(+) homeostasis. A potassium-sensing niche in Arabidopsis roots orchestrates signaling and adaptation responses to maintain\nconcentrations. Despite its functional relevance in plant nutrition, information about functional domains of HAK5 is scarce. Its activity is enhanced by phosphorylation via the AtCIPK23/AtCBL1-9 complex. Based on the recently published three-dimensionalstructure of the bacterial ortholog KimA from Bacillus subtilis, we have modeled AtHAK5 and, by a mutational approach, identified residues G67, Y70, G71, D72, D201, and E312 as essential for transporter function. According to the structural model, residues D72, D201, and E312 may bind K+, whereas residues G67, Y70, and G71 may shape the selective filter for K+, which resembles that of K+shaker-like channels. In addition, we show that phosphorylation of residue S35 by AtCIPK23 is required for reaching maximal transport activity. Serial deletions of the AtHAK5 C-terminus disclosed the presence of an autoinhibitory domain located between residues 571 and 633 together with an AtCIPK23-dependent activation domain downstream of position 633. Presumably, autoinhibition of AtHAK5 is counteracted by phosphorylation\nan essential macronutrient for plants. It is acquired by specific uptake systems located in roots. Although the concentrations of K(+) in the soil solution are widely variable, K(+) nutrition is secured by uptake systems that exhibit different affinities for K(+). Two main systems have been described for root K(+) uptake in several species: the high-affinity HAK5-like transporter and the inward-rectifier AKT1-like channel. Other unidentified systems may be also involved in root K(+) uptake, although they only seem to operate when K(+) is not limiting. The use of knock-out lines has allowed demonstrating their role in root K(+) uptake in Arabidopsis and rice. Plant adaptation to the different K(+) supplies relies on the finely tuned regulation of these systems. Low K(+)-induced transcriptional up-regulation of the genes encoding HAK5-like transporters occurs through a signal cascade that includes changes in the membrane potential of root cells and increases in ethylene and reactive oxygen\nThe CBL-Interacting Protein Kinase CIPK23 Regulates HAK5-Mediated High-Affinity K+ Uptake in Arabidopsis Roots. Plant growth and development requires efficient acquisition of essential elements. Potassium (K(+)) is an important macronutrient present in the soil solution at a wide range of concentrations. Regulation of the K(+) uptake systems in the roots is essential to secure K(+) supply. It has been shown in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) that when the external K(+) concentration is very low (<10 \u00b5m), K(+) nutrition depends exclusively on the high-affinity K(+) transporter5 (HAK5). Low-K(+)-induced transcriptional activation of the gene encoding HAK5 has been previously reported. Here, we show the posttranscriptional regulation of HAK5 transport activity by phosphorylation. Expression in a heterologous system showed that the Ca(2+) sensors calcineurin B-like (CBL1), CBL8, CBL9, and CBL10, together with CBL-interacting protein kinase23 (CIPK23), activated HAK5 in vivo. This activation produced an increase in the affinity and the Vmax of K(+) transport. In\nand 633 together with an AtCIPK23-dependent activation domain downstream of position 633. Presumably, autoinhibition of AtHAK5 is counteracted by phosphorylation of S35 by AtCIPK23. Our results provide a molecular model for K+ transport and describe CIPK-CBL-mediated regulation of plant HAK transporters. The Raf-like Kinase ILK1 and the High Affinity K+ Transporter HAK5 Are Required for Innate Immunity and Abiotic Stress Response. Plant perception of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and other environmental stresses trigger transient ion fluxes at the plasma membrane. Apart from the role of Ca(2+) uptake in signaling, the regulation and significance of PAMP-induced ion fluxes in immunity remain unknown. We characterized the functions of INTEGRIN-LINKED KINASE1 (ILK1) that encodes a Raf-like MAP2K kinase with functions insufficiently understood in plants. Analysis of ILK1 mutants impaired in the expression or kinase activity revealed that ILK1 contributes to plant defense to bacterial pathogens, osmotic stress sensitivity, and cellular responses and total\ncarrying segments from XieqingzaoB in the genetic background of Zhonghui9308 (ZH9308). CSSL35 developed more roots than ZH9308 under LK at the seedling stage, and qRN5a was initially located within a 1,023-kb genomic region. In this study, to understand the molecular basis of qRN5a, a large F2:3 (BC5F2:3) population obtained from crossing CSSL35 and ZH9308 was constructed for fine mapping. High-resolution linkage analysis narrowed down qRN5a to a 48.8-kb interval flanked by markers A99 and A139. Seven putative candidate genes were annotated in the delimited region, and three genes (Os05g0346700, LOC_Os05g27980, and LOC_Os05g28000) had nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding sequence between the two parents. Expression analysis suggests that LOC_Os05g27980, which encodes a LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES domain-containing protein, is a positive regulator of RN under LK and is the most likely candidate gene for qRN5a. Moreover, we found that qRN5a promotes expression of OsIAA23 and represses OsHAK5 expression in root tissues\nprotein CML9. ILK1 also has a kinase-independent function in salt stress suggesting that it interacts with additional proteins. We determined that members of the ILK subfamily are the sole pseudokinases within the Raf-like MAP3K family and identified 179 novel putative ILK1 protein interactors. We also identified 70 novel peptide targets for ILK1, the majority of which were phosphorylated in the presence of Mn2+ instead of Mg2+ in line with modifications in ILK1's DFG cofactor binding domain. Overall, the ILK1-targeted or interacting proteins included diverse protein types including transporters (HAK5, STP1), protein kinases (MEKK1, MEKK3), and a cytokinin receptor (AHK2). The expression of 31 genes encoding putative ILK1-interacting or phosphorylated proteins, including AHK2, were altered in the root and shoot in response to molecular patterns suggesting a role for these genes in immunity. We describe a potential role for ILK1 interactors in the context of cation-dependent immune signaling, highlighting the importance\na signal cascade that includes changes in the membrane potential of root cells and increases in ethylene and reactive oxygen species concentrations. Activation of AKT1 channels occurs through phosphorylation by the CIPK23/CBL1 complex. Recently, activation of the Arabidopsis HAK5 by the same complex has been reported, pointing to CIPK23/CBL as a central regulator of the plant's adaptation to low K(+). Na(+) is not an essential plant nutrient but it may be beneficial for some plants. At low concentrations, Na(+) improves growth, especially under K(+) deficiency. Thus, high-affinity Na(+) uptake systems have been described that belong to the HKT and HAK families of transporters. At high concentrations, typical of saline environments, Na(+) accumulates in plant tissues at high concentrations, producing alterations that include toxicity, water deficit and K(+) deficiency. Data concerning pathways for Na(+) uptake into roots under saline conditions are still scarce, although several possibilities have been proposed. The apoplast\npathways for Na(+) uptake into roots under saline conditions are still scarce, although several possibilities have been proposed. The apoplast is a significant pathway for Na(+) uptake in rice grown under salinity conditions, but in other plant species different mechanisms involving non-selective cation channels or transporters are under discussion.",

        "desc": "coupling between the motion of the VSD and the selectivity filter of the PD, in accordance with recent empirical data. There are no direct contacts between the VSDs of the four subunits, and the contacts between these and the PDs are loose, suggesting that the VSDs are capable of functioning independently. Indeed, they manifest many inherent fluctuations that are decoupled from the rest of the structure. In general, the analysis suggests that the two domains contribute to the channel function both individually and cooperatively. Structural and functional characterization of Kv6.2 a new gamma-subunit of voltage-gated potassium channel. We have cloned and functionally expressed Kv6.2, a new member of the Kv6 subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channel subunits. The human Kv6.2 (KCNF2) gene was mapped at 18q22-18q23. Kv6.2 mRNA is preferentially expressed in rat and human myocard. Rat and human Kv6.2 subunits appear to be unable to form functional Kv channels in\npore coupling. Our work exposes the multigenic, molecular etiology of a variant associated with epilepsy and reveals that charge-transfer-center disruption has different effects in KV1.2 and Shaker, the archetypes for potassium channel structure and function. The Kv\u03b22 subunit of voltage-gated potassium channels is interacting with ProSAP2/Shank3 in the PSD. The postsynaptic density is an electron dense meshwork composed of a variety of molecules facilitating neuronal signal transmission. ProSAP2/Shank3 represents a crucial player at postsynaptic sites, assembling large multimeric platforms and anchoring numerous other molecules, thereby linking the functional synapse with the cytoskeleton. ProSAP2/Shank3 is also implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including autism spectrum disorders. KvBeta2 (Kv\u03b22) on the other hand serves as a regulatory subunit of voltage-gated potassium channels. Kv\u03b22 is located at various sites in the neuron including the axon (binding to Kv1.2), the dendrites (binding to Kv4.2) and the synapse. Binding of Kv\u03b22 to either Kv1.2\nalpha subunit contains six transmembrane segments, including an intrinsic voltage sensor. In contrast, inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels have just two transmembrane segments in each of its four pore-lining alpha subunits. A variety of intracellular second messengers mediate transmitter and metabolic regulation of Kir channels. For example, Kir3 (GIRK) channels open on binding to the G protein betagamma subunits, thereby mediating slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in the brain. Our structure-based functional analysis on the cytoplasmic N-terminal tetramerization domain T1 of the voltage-gated channel, Kv1.2, uncovered a new function for this domain, modulation of voltage gating, and suggested a possible means of communication between second messenger pathways and Kv channels. A yeast screen for active Kir3.2 channels subjected to random mutagenesis has identified residues in the transmembrane segments that are crucial for controlling the opening of Kir3.2 channels. The identification of structural elements involved in potassium channel gating in these systems\nthe excitatory/inhibitory balance of neuronal circuits. Independent and cooperative motions of the Kv1.2 channel: voltage sensing and gating. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels, such as Kv1.2, are involved in the generation and propagation of action potentials. The Kv channel is a homotetramer, and each monomer is composed of a voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and a pore domain (PD). We analyzed the fluctuations of a model structure of Kv1.2 using elastic network models. The analysis suggested a network of coupled fluctuations of eight rigid structural units and seven hinges that may control the transition between the active and inactive states of the channel. For the most part, the network is composed of amino acids that are known to affect channel activity. The results suggested allosteric interactions and cooperativity between the subunits in the coupling between the motion of the VSD and the selectivity filter of the PD, in accordance with recent empirical data.\ninfancy and results from point mutations in the voltage-gated potassium channel gene hKv1.1. The hallmark of the disease is continuous myokymia and episodic attacks of spastic contractions of the skeletal muscles, which cause permanent disability. Coexpression of hKv1.1 and hKv1.2 subunits produces heteromeric potassium channels with biophysical and pharmacological properties intermediate between the respective homomers. By using tandemly linked subunits, we demonstrate that hKv1.1 subunits bearing the EA-1 mutations V408A and E325D combine with hKv1.2 to produce channels with altered kinetics of activation, deactivation, C-type inactivation, and voltage dependence. Moreover, hKv1.1V408A single-channel analysis reveals a approximately threefold reduction of the mean open duration of the channel compared with the wild-type, and this mutation alters the open-state stability of both homomeric and heteromeric channels. The results demonstrate that human Kv1.2 and Kv1.1 subunits coassemble to form a novel channel with distinct gating properties that are altered profoundly by EA-1 mutations, thus\na similar bidirectional regulation as in the Cav channels. The two effects could be distinguished kinetically, in terms of their sensitivities to PIP(2) and by distinct molecular determinants. The rightward shift of the Kv1.2 voltage dependence implicated basic residues in the S4-S5 linker and was consistent with stabilization of the inactive state of the voltage sensor. A third type of a voltage-gated ion channel modulated by PIP(2) is the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel. PIP(2) has been shown to enhance the opening of HCN channels by shifting their voltage-dependent activation toward depolarized potentials. The sea urchin HCN channel, SpIH, showed again a PIP(2)-mediated bidirectional effect but in reverse order than the depolarization-activated Cav and Kv channels: a voltage-dependent potentiation, like the mammalian HCN channels, but also an inhibition of the cGMP-induced current activation. Just like the Kv1.2 channels, distinct molecular determinants underlied the PIP(2) dual effects on SpIH, with the\nin mice lacking the potassium channel subunit Kv1.2, but hypoexcitability and enlarged Kv1 currents in auditory neurons. Genes Kcna1 and Kcna2 code for the voltage-dependent potassium channel subunits Kv1.1 and Kv1.2, which are coexpressed in large axons and commonly present within the same tetramers. Both contribute to the low-voltage-activated potassium current I Kv1, which powerfully limits excitability and facilitates temporally precise transmission of information, e.g., in auditory neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Kcna1-null mice lacking Kv1.1 exhibited seizure susceptibility and hyperexcitability in axons and MNTB neurons, which also had reduced I Kv1. To explore whether a lack of Kv1.2 would cause a similar phenotype, we created and characterized Kcna2-null mice (-/-). The -/- mice exhibited increased seizure susceptibility compared with their +/+ and +/- littermates, as early as P14. The mRNA for Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 increased strongly in +/+ brain stems between P7 and P14,\nmight be able to fine-tune their excitability by adjusting the Kv1.1:Kv1.2 balance rather than altering Kv1 channel density. The glycosylation state of Kv1.2 potassium channels affects trafficking, gating, and simulated action potentials. We presented evidence previously that decreasing the glycosylation state of the Kv1.1 potassium channel modified its gating by a combined surface potential and a cooperative subunit interaction mechanism and these effects modified simulated action potentials. Here we continued to test the hypothesis that glycosylation affects channel function in a predictable fashion by increasing and decreasing the glycosylation state of Kv1.2 channels. Compared with Kv1.2, increasing the glycosylation state shifted the V(1/2) negatively with a steeper G-V slope, increased activation kinetics with little change in deactivation kinetics or in their voltage-dependence, and decreased the apparent level of C-type inactivation. Decreasing the glycosylation state had essentially the opposite effects and shifted the V(1/2) positively with a shallower G-V slope, decreased\nThe glycosylation state of Kv1.2 also affected action potentials in simulations. In addition, preventing N-glycosylation decreased cell surface Kv1.2 expression levels by approximately 40% primarily by increasing partial endoplasmic reticulum retention and this effect was completely rescued by Kv1.4 subunits, which are glycosylated, but not by cytoplasmic Kvbeta2.1 subunits. The nonglycosylated Kv1.2 protein had a similar protein half-life as the glycosylated protein and appeared to be folded properly. Thus altering the native Kv1.2 glycosylation state affected its trafficking, gating, and simulated action potentials. Differential glycosylation of ion channels could be used by excitable cells to modify cell signaling. Mutations in the KCNA1 gene associated with episodic ataxia type-1 syndrome impair heteromeric voltage-gated K(+) channel function. Episodic ataxia type-1 syndrome (EA-1) is an autosomal dominant neurological disorder that manifests itself during infancy and results from point mutations in the voltage-gated potassium channel gene hKv1.1. The hallmark of the disease is continuous\n16 years, there has been an impressive number of ion channels shown to be sensitive to the major phosphoinositide in the plasma membrane, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)). Among them are voltage-gated channels, which are crucial for both neuronal and cardiac excitability. Voltage-gated calcium (Cav) channels were shown to be regulated bidirectionally by PIP(2). On one hand, PIP(2) stabilized their activity by reducing current rundown but on the other hand it produced a voltage-dependent inhibition by shifting the activation curve to more positive voltages. For voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels PIP(2) was first shown to prevent N-type inactivation regardless of whether the fast inactivation gate was part of the pore-forming \u03b1 subunit or of an accessory \u03b2 subunit. Careful examination of the effects of PIP(2) on the activation mechanism of Kv1.2 has shown a similar bidirectional regulation as in the Cav channels. The two effects could be distinguished kinetically, in terms of their\nvoltage-sensing domain of KV1.2-F302L channels is more sensitive to depolarization. Accordingly, KV1.2-F302L channels opened faster and at more negative potentials; however, they also exhibited enhanced inactivation: that is, F302L causes both gain- and loss-of-function effects. Coexpression of KCNA2-WT and -F302L did not fully rescue these effects. The proband's symptoms are more characteristic of patients with loss of KCNA2 function. Enhanced KV1.2 inactivation could lead to increased synaptic release in excitatory neurons, steering neuronal circuits towards epilepsy.ABSTRACT: An exome-based diagnostic panel in an infant with epilepsy revealed a previously unreported de novo missense variant in KCNA2, which encodes voltage-gated K+ channel KV1.2. This variant causes substitution F302L, in helix S4 of the KV1.2 voltage-sensing domain (VSD). F302L does not affect KCNA2 subunit membrane trafficking. However, it does alter channel functional properties, accelerating channel opening at more hyperpolarized membrane potentials, indicating gain of function. F302L also caused loss of KV1.2 function via\naccelerating channel opening at more hyperpolarized membrane potentials, indicating gain of function. F302L also caused loss of KV1.2 function via accelerated inactivation onset, decelerated recovery and shifted inactivation voltage dependence to more negative potentials. These effects, which are not fully rescued by coexpression of wild-type and mutant KCNA2 subunits, probably result from the enhancement of VSD function, as demonstrated by optically tracking VSD depolarization-evoked conformational rearrangements. In turn, molecular dynamics simulations suggest altered VSD exposure to membrane lipids. Compared to other encephalopathy patients with KCNA2 mutations, the proband exhibits mild neurological impairment, more characteristic of patients with KCNA2 loss of function. Based on this information, we propose a mechanism of epileptogenesis based on enhanced KV1.2 inactivation leading to increased synaptic release preferentially in excitatory neurons, and hence the perturbation of the excitatory/inhibitory balance of neuronal circuits. Independent and cooperative motions of the Kv1.2 channel: voltage sensing and gating. Voltage-gated potassium\ncGMP-induced current activation. Just like the Kv1.2 channels, distinct molecular determinants underlied the PIP(2) dual effects on SpIH, with the proximal C-terminus implicated in the inhibitory effect. The dual regulation of these very different ion channels, all of which are voltage-dependent, points to conserved mechanisms of regulation of these channels by PIP(2). Impact of ancillary subunits on ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels generate the outward K(+) ion currents that constitute the primary force in ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium channels comprise tetramers of pore-forming alpha subunits and, in probably most cases in vivo, ancillary or beta subunits that help define the properties of the Kv current generated. Ancillary subunits can be broadly categorized as cytoplasmic or transmembrane and can modify Kv channel trafficking, conductance, gating, ion selectivity, regulation, and pharmacology. Because of their often profound effects on Kv channel function, studies of the molecular correlates of ventricular repolarization must take\nfor controlling the opening of Kir3.2 channels. The identification of structural elements involved in potassium channel gating in these systems highlights principles that may be important in the regulation of other types of channels. Notch enhances Ca2+ entry by activating calcium-sensing receptors and inhibiting voltage-gated K+ channels. The increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) and upregulation of calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) and stromal interaction molecule 2 (STIM2) along with inhibition of voltage-gated K+ (KV) channels in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMC) have been implicated in the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension; however, the precise upstream mechanisms remain elusive. Activation of CaSR, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), results in Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR) and Ca2+ influx through receptor-operated and store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOC). Upon Ca2+ depletion from the SR, STIM forms clusters to mediate store-operated Ca2+ entry. Activity of KV channels, like KCNA5/KV1.5 and KCNA2/KV1.2, contributes to regulating\nnovel mutation in the shaker type voltage-gated potassium channel KCNA2 (CCDS_827.1: c.765_773del; p.255_257del). A rare missense SCN2A (rs200884216) variant was also found in 2 affected siblings and their unaffected mother. The p.255_257del mutation caused dominant negative loss of channel function. Molecular modeling predicted repositioning of critical arginine residues in the voltage-sensing domain. KCNA2 sequencing revealed 1 de novo mutation (CCDS_827.1: c.890G>A; p.Arg297Gln) in a girl with EE, ataxia, and tremor.CONCLUSIONS: A KCNA2 mutation caused dominantly inherited episodic ataxia, mild infantile-onset seizures, and later generalized and focal epilepsies in the setting of normal intellect. This observation expands the KCNA2 phenotypic spectrum from EE often associated with chronic ataxia, reflecting the marked variation in severity observed in many ion channel disorders. Dual Regulation of Voltage-Sensitive Ion Channels by PIP(2). Over the past 16 years, there has been an impressive number of ion channels shown to be sensitive to the major phosphoinositide in\nthe S1 segment of the voltage sensor in one subunit and both the S5 segment and top of the pore helix from another subunit. This interface evidently plays an important role in channel gating. Controlling potassium channel activities: Interplay between the membrane and intracellular factors. Neural signaling is based on the regulated timing and extent of channel opening; therefore, it is important to understand how ion channels open and close in response to neurotransmitters and intracellular messengers. Here, we examine this question for potassium channels, an extraordinarily diverse group of ion channels. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels control action-potential waveforms and neuronal firing patterns by opening and closing in response to membrane-potential changes. These effects can be strongly modulated by cytoplasmic factors such as kinases, phosphatases, and small GTPases. A Kv alpha subunit contains six transmembrane segments, including an intrinsic voltage sensor. In contrast, inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels have just\nand design of specific current-targeted compounds. Here, we discuss current thinking and lines of experimentation aimed at resolving the complexities of the Kv channel complexes that repolarize the human ventricular myocardium. Structural models for the KCNQ1 voltage-gated potassium channel. Mutations in the human voltage-gated potassium channel KCNQ1 are associated with predisposition to deafness and various cardiac arrhythmia syndromes including congenital long QT syndrome, familial atrial fibrillation, and sudden infant death syndrome. In this work 3-D structural models were developed for both the open and closed states of human KCNQ1 to facilitate structurally based hypotheses regarding mutation-phenotype relationships. The KCNQ1 open state was modeled using Rosetta in conjunction with Molecular Operating Environment software, and is based primarily on the recently determined open state structure of rat Kv1.2 (Long, S. B., et al. (2005) Science 309, 897-903). The closed state model for KCNQ1 was developed based on the crystal structures of bacterial\nKv1.1 subunits coassemble to form a novel channel with distinct gating properties that are altered profoundly by EA-1 mutations, thus uncovering novel physiopathogenetic mechanisms of episodic ataxia type-1 myokymia syndrome. Tracking the motion of the KV1.2 voltage sensor reveals the molecular perturbations caused by a de novo mutation in a case of epilepsy. KEY POINTS: KV1.2 channels, encoded by the KCNA2 gene, regulate neuronal excitability by conducting K+ upon depolarization. A new KCNA2 missense variant was discovered in a patient with epilepsy, causing amino acid substitution F302L at helix S4, in the KV1.2 voltage-sensing domain. Immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry showed that F302L does not impair KCNA2 subunit surface trafficking. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that F302L alters the exposure of S4 residues to membrane lipids. Voltage clamp fluorometry revealed that the voltage-sensing domain of KV1.2-F302L channels is more sensitive to depolarization. Accordingly, KV1.2-F302L channels opened faster and at more negative potentials;\nKv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels in developmental perspective. Kv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels consist of two types of \u03b1-subunits: (a) electrically-active Kcnb1 \u03b1-subunits and (b) silent or modulatory \u03b1-subunits plus \u03b2-subunits that, similar to silent \u03b1-subunits, also regulate electrically-active subunits. Voltage-gated potassium channels were traditionally viewed, mainly by electrophysiologists, as regulators of the electrical activity of the plasma membrane in excitable cells, a role that is performed by transmembrane protein domains of \u03b1-subunits that form the electric pore. Genetic studies revealed a role for this region of \u03b1-subunits of voltage-gated potassium channels in human neurodevelopmental disorders, such as epileptic encephalopathy. The N- and C-terminal domains of \u03b1-subunits interact to form the cytoplasmic subunit of heterotetrameric potassium channels that regulate electric pores. Subsequent animal studies revealed the developmental functions of Kcnb1-containing voltage-gated potassium channels and illustrated their role during brain development and reproduction. These functions of potassium channels are discussed in this review\nE236K channels correlates with the mild end of the clinical spectrum reported in patients with GoF/LoF defects. The response to 4-AP corroborates existing evidence that KCNA2-disorders could benefit from variant-tailored therapeutic approaches, based on functional studies. An epilepsy-associated KV1.2 charge-transfer-center mutation impairs KV1.2 and KV1.4 trafficking. We report on a heterozygous KCNA2 variant in a child with epilepsy. KCNA2 encodes KV1.2 subunits, which form homotetrameric potassium channels and participate in heterotetrameric channel complexes with other KV1-family subunits, regulating neuronal excitability. The mutation causes substitution F233S at the KV1.2 charge transfer center of the voltage-sensing domain. Immunocytochemical trafficking assays showed that KV1.2(F233S) subunits are trafficking deficient and reduce the surface expression of wild-type KV1.2 and KV1.4: a dominant-negative phenotype extending beyond KCNA2, likely profoundly perturbing electrical signaling. Yet some KV1.2(F233S) trafficking was rescued by wild-type KV1.2 and KV1.4 subunits, likely in permissible heterotetrameric stoichiometries: electrophysiological studies utilizing applied transcriptomics and concatemer",

The ability of dopamine receptors to interact with other receptor subtypes may provide mechanisms for modulating dopamine-related functions and behaviors. In particular, there is evidence suggesting that the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) affects the dopaminergic system by regulating the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons or by altering dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) responsiveness to ligands. TAAR1 is a G\u03b1(s) protein-coupled receptor that is activated by biogenic amines, \"trace amines,\" such as \u03b2-phenylethylamine (\u03b2-PEA) and tyramine that are normally found at low concentrations in the mammalian brain. In the present study, we investigated the biochemical mechanism of interaction between TAAR1 and D2R and the role this interaction plays in D2R-related signaling and behaviors. Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer biosensor for cAMP, we demonstrated that the D2R antagonists haloperidol, raclopride, and amisulpride were able to enhance selectively a TAAR1-mediated \u03b2-PEA\nspecies-specific differences between human and mouse TAAR1. Our study provides insights into the mechanism of ligand recognition and G-protein selectivity by TAAR1, which may help in the discovery of ligands or therapeutic strategies for neurological and metabolic disorders. Trace Amines and the Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1: Pharmacology, Neurochemistry, and Clinical Implications. Biogenic amines are a collection of endogenous molecules that play pivotal roles as neurotransmitters and hormones. In addition to the \"classical\" biogenic amines resulting from decarboxylation of aromatic acids, including dopamine (DA), norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin (5-HT), and histamine, other biogenic amines, present at much lower concentrations in the central nervous system (CNS), and hence referred to as \"trace\" amines (TAs), are now recognized to play significant neurophysiological and behavioral functions. At the turn of the century, the discovery of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a phylogenetically conserved G protein-coupled receptor that is responsive to both TAs, such as\ndysregulation, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, mood disorders, and addiction. Indeed, the recent development of novel pharmacological tools targeting TAAR1 has uncovered the remarkable potential of TAAR1-based medications as new generation pharmacotherapies in neuropsychiatry. This review summarizes recent developments in the study of TAs and TAAR1, their intricate neurochemistry and pharmacology, and their relevance for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease. Recognition of methamphetamine and other amines by trace amine receptor TAAR1. Trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), the founding member of a nine-member family of trace amine receptors, is responsible for recognizing a range of biogenic amines in the brain, including the endogenous \u03b2-phenylethylamine (\u03b2-PEA)1 as well as methamphetamine2, an abused substance that has posed a severe threat to human health and society3. Given its unique physiological role in the brain, TAAR1 is also an emerging target for a range of neurological disorders including schizophrenia, depression and drug addiction2,4,5. Here we report structures\nfor cAMP, we demonstrated that the D2R antagonists haloperidol, raclopride, and amisulpride were able to enhance selectively a TAAR1-mediated \u03b2-PEA increase of cAMP. Moreover, TAAR1 and D2R were able to form heterodimers when coexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and this direct interaction was disrupted in the presence of haloperidol. In addition, in mice lacking TAAR1, haloperidol-induced striatal c-Fos expression and catalepsy were significantly reduced. Taken together, these data suggest that TAAR1 and D2R have functional and physical interactions that could be critical for the modulation of the dopaminergic system by TAAR1 in vivo. Ligand recognition and G-protein coupling of trace amine receptor TAAR1. Trace-amine-associated receptors (TAARs), a group of biogenic amine receptors, have essential roles in neurological and metabolic homeostasis1. They recognize diverse endogenous trace amines and subsequently activate a range of G-protein-subtype signalling pathways2,3. Notably, TAAR1 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for treating psychiatric disorders4,5.\nthe trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a phylogenetically conserved G protein-coupled receptor that is responsive to both TAs, such as \u03b2-phenylethylamine, octopamine, and tyramine, and structurally-related amphetamines, unveiled mechanisms of action for TAs other than interference with aminergic pathways, laying the foundations for deciphering the functional significance of TAs and its mammalian CNS receptor, TAAR1. Although, its molecular interactions and downstream targets have not been fully elucidated, TAAR1 activation triggers accumulation of intracellular cAMP, modulates PKA and PKC signaling and interferes with the \u03b2-arrestin2-dependent pathway via G protein-independent mechanisms. TAAR1 is uniquely positioned to exert direct control over DA and 5-HT neuronal firing and release, which has profound implications for understanding the pathophysiology of, and therefore designing more efficacious therapeutic interventions for, a range of neuropsychiatric disorders that involve aminergic dysregulation, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, mood disorders, and addiction. Indeed, the recent development of novel pharmacological tools targeting TAAR1 has\nactivate a range of G-protein-subtype signalling pathways2,3. Notably, TAAR1 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for treating psychiatric disorders4,5. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its ability to recognize different ligands remain largely unclear. Here we present nine cryo-electron microscopy structures, with eight showing human and mouse TAAR1 in a complex with an array of ligands, including the endogenous 3-iodothyronamine, two antipsychotic agents, the psychoactive drug amphetamine and two identified catecholamine agonists, and one showing 5-HT1AR in a complex with an antipsychotic agent. These structures reveal a rigid consensus binding motif in TAAR1 that binds to endogenous trace amine stimuli and two extended binding pockets that accommodate diverse chemotypes. Combined with mutational analysis, functional assays and molecular dynamic simulations, we elucidate the structural basis of drug polypharmacology and identify the species-specific differences between human and mouse TAAR1. Our study provides insights into the mechanism of ligand recognition and G-protein selectivity\nalso an emerging target for a range of neurological disorders including schizophrenia, depression and drug addiction2,4,5. Here we report structures of human TAAR1-G-protein complexes bound to methamphetamine and \u03b2-PEA as well as complexes bound to RO5256390, a TAAR1-selective agonist, and SEP-363856, a clinical-stage dual agonist for TAAR1 and serotonin receptor 5-HT1AR (refs. 6,7). Together with systematic mutagenesis and functional studies, the structures reveal the molecular basis of methamphetamine recognition and underlying mechanisms of ligand selectivity and polypharmacology between TAAR1 and other monoamine receptors. We identify a lid-like extracellular loop 2 helix/loop structure and a hydrogen-bonding network in the ligand-binding pockets, which may contribute to the ligand recognition in TAAR1. These findings shed light on the ligand recognition mode and activation mechanism for TAAR1 and should guide the development of next-generation therapeutics for drug addiction and various neurological disorders.",

We found that RNase J extracted from H. pylori is acetylated on multiple lysine residues. Alanine substitution of several of these residues impacts on H. pylori morphology, and thus on RNase J function in vivo. Mutations of Lysine 649 modulates RNase J oligomerization in vitro, which in turn influences ribonuclease activity in vitro. Our structural analyses of RNase\nensures the 5'-monophosphate preferential exoribonucleolysis. To achieve exoribonucleolytic processivity, the 5'-monophosphate-binding pocket and nucleotide +4 binding site anchor RNA within the catalytic track; the 5'-capping residue Leu37 of the sandwich pocket coupled with the 5'-monophosphate-binding pocket are dedicated to translocating and controlling the RNA orientation for each exoribonucleolytic cycle. The processive-exoribonucleolysis mechanism was verified as conserved in bacterial RNase J and also exposes striking parallels with the non-homologous eukaryotic 5'-3' exoribonuclease, Xrn1. The findings in this work shed light on not only the molecular mechanism of the RNase J family, but also the evolutionary convergence of divergent exoribonucleases. Structural insights into catalysis and dimerization enhanced exonuclease activity of RNase J. RNase J is a conserved ribonuclease that belongs to the \u03b2-CASP family of nucleases. It possesses both endo- and exo-ribonuclease activities, which play a key role in pre-rRNA maturation and mRNA decay. Here we report high-resolution crystal structures of Deinococcus\n649 modulates RNase J oligomerization in vitro, which in turn influences ribonuclease activity in vitro. Our structural analyses of RNase J reveal loops that gate access to the active site and rationalizes how acetylation state of K649 can influence activity. We propose acetylation as a regulatory level controlling the activity of RNase J and its potential cooperation with other enzymes of RNA metabolism in H. pylori. Emergence of the \u03b2-CASP ribonucleases: highly conserved and ubiquitous metallo-enzymes involved in messenger RNA maturation and degradation. The \u03b2-CASP ribonucleases, which are found in the three domains of life, have in common a core of 460 residues containing seven conserved sequence motifs involved in the tight binding of two catalytic zinc ions. A hallmark of these enzymes is their ability to catalyze both endo- and exo-ribonucleolytic degradation. Exo-ribonucleolytic degradation proceeds in the 5' to 3' direction and is sensitive to the phosphorylation state of\ncomplexes directing messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation are present in all kingdoms of life. In Escherichia coli, mRNA degradation is performed by an RNA degradosome organized by the major ribonuclease RNase E. In bacteria lacking RNase E, the existence of a functional RNA degradosome is still an open question. Here, we report that in the bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori, RNA degradation is directed by a minimal RNA degradosome consisting of Hp-RNase J and the only DExD-box RNA helicase of H. pylori, RhpA. We show that the protein complex promotes faster degradation of double-stranded RNA in vitro in comparison with Hp-RNase J alone. The ATPase activity of RhpA is stimulated in the presence of Hp-RNase J, demonstrating that the catalytic capacity of both partners is enhanced upon interaction. Remarkably, both proteins are associated with translating ribosomes and not with individual 30S and 50S subunits. Moreover, Hp-RNase J is not recruited to ribosomes\nRNA metabolism highlighting their potential vulnerability as drug targets. New molecular insights into an archaeal RNase J reveal a conserved processive exoribonucleolysis mechanism of the RNase J family. RNase J, a prokaryotic 5'-3' exo/endoribonuclease, contributes to mRNA decay, rRNA maturation and post-transcriptional regulation. Yet the processive-exoribonucleolysis mechanism remains obscure. Here, we solved the first RNA-free and RNA-bound structures of an archaeal RNase J, and through intensive biochemical studies provided detailed mechanistic insights into the catalysis and processivity. Distinct dimerization/tetramerization patterns were observed for archaeal and bacterial RNase Js, and unique archaeal Loops I and II were found involved in RNA interaction. A hydrogen-bond-network was identified for the first time that assists catalysis by facilitating efficient proton transfer in the catalytic center. A conserved 5'-monophosphate-binding pocket that coordinates the RNA 5'-end ensures the 5'-monophosphate preferential exoribonucleolysis. To achieve exoribonucleolytic processivity, the 5'-monophosphate-binding pocket and nucleotide +4 binding site anchor RNA within\nlittle is known about mechanisms that shape the transcriptome by regulating RNA decay rates. The aim of the present study is to identify the core components of the RNA degradosome of M. tuberculosis and to analyse their function in RNA metabolism. Using an approach involving cross-linking to 4-thiouridine-labelled RNA, we mapped the mycobacterial RNA-bound proteome and identified degradosome-related enzymes polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), ATP-dependent RNA helicase (RhlE), ribonuclease E (RNase E) and ribonuclease J (RNase J) as major components. We then carried out affinity purification of eGFP-tagged recombinant constructs to identify protein-protein interactions. This identified further interactions with cold-shock proteins and novel KH-domain proteins. Engineering and transcriptional profiling of strains with a reduced level of expression of core degradosome ribonucleases provided evidence of important pleiotropic roles of the enzymes in mycobacterial RNA metabolism highlighting their potential vulnerability as drug targets. New molecular insights into an archaeal RNase J reveal a conserved\nStructural insights into RNase J that plays an essential role in Mycobacterium tuberculosis RNA metabolism. Ribonucleases (RNases) are responsible for RNA metabolism. RNase J, the core enzyme of the RNA degradosome, plays an essential role in global mRNA decay. Emerging evidence showed that the RNase J of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb-RNase J) could be an excellent target for treating Mtb infection. Here, crystal structures of Mtb-RNase J in apo-state and complex with the single-strand RNA reveal the conformational change upon RNA binding and hydrolysis. Mtb-RNase J forms an active homodimer through the interactions between the \u03b2-CASP and the \u03b2-lactamase domain. Knockout of RNase J slows the growth rate and changes the colony morphologies and cell length in Mycobacterium smegmatis, which is restored by RNase J complementation. Finally, RNA-seq analysis shows that the knockout strain significantly changes the expression levels of 49 genes in metabolic pathways. Thus, our current study explores the\nand exo-ribonucleolytic degradation. Exo-ribonucleolytic degradation proceeds in the 5' to 3' direction and is sensitive to the phosphorylation state of the 5' end of a transcript. Recent phylogenomic analyses have shown that the \u03b2-CASP ribonucleases can be partitioned into two major subdivisions that correspond to orthologs of eukaryal CPSF73 and bacterial RNase J. We discuss the known functions of the CPSF73 and RNase J orthologs, their association into complexes, and their structure as it relates to mechanism of action. Eukaryal CPSF73 is part of a large multiprotein complex that is involved in the maturation of the 3' end of RNA Polymerase II transcripts and the polyadenylation of messenger RNA. RNase J1 and J2 are paralogs in Bacillus subtilis that are involved in the degradation of messenger RNA and the maturation of non-coding RNA. RNase J1 and J2 co-purify as a heteromeric complex and there is recent evidence that they interact\nactivities, which play a key role in pre-rRNA maturation and mRNA decay. Here we report high-resolution crystal structures of Deinococcus radiodurans RNase J complexed with RNA or uridine 5'-monophosphate in the presence of manganese ions. Biochemical and structural studies revealed that RNase J uses zinc ions for two-metal-ion catalysis. One residue conserved among RNase J orthologues (motif B) forms specific electrostatic interactions with the scissile phosphate of the RNA that is critical for the catalysis and product stabilization. The additional manganese ion, which is coordinated by conserved residues at the dimer interface, is critical for RNase J dimerization and exonuclease activity. The structures may also shed light on the mechanism of RNase J exo- and endonucleolytic activity switch. A minimal bacterial RNase J-based degradosome is associated with translating ribosomes. Protein complexes directing messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation are present in all kingdoms of life. In Escherichia coli, mRNA degradation is performed\nsome of which were highly biased for either the cytoplasmic or membrane fractions. We also determined that the RNase J2 C-terminal domain (CTD) encodes a structure that is likely conserved among RNase J enzymes and may have an analogous function to the C-terminal portion of RNase E. While we did observe a number of parallels between the RNase J2 interactome and the E. coli degradosome paradigm, our results suggest that S. mutans degradosomes are either unlikely to exist or are quite distinct from those of E. coli.\ncomplex containing RNase E and a variety of additional enzymes. In the Firmicutes phylum, species lack RNase E and often encode the paralogous enzymes RNase J1 and RNase J2. Unlike RNase J1, surprisingly little is known about the regulatory function and protein interactions of RNase J2, despite being a central pleiotropic regulator for the streptococci and other closely related organisms. Using crosslink coimmunoprecipitation in Streptococcus mutans, we have identified the major proteins found within RNase J2 protein complexes located in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane. In both subcellular fractions, RNase J2 exhibited the most robust interactions with RNase J1, while additional transient and/or weaker \"degradosome-like\" interactions were also detected. In addition, RNase J2 exhibits multiple novel interactions that have not been previously reported for any RNase J proteins, some of which were highly biased for either the cytoplasmic or membrane fractions. We also determined that the RNase J2\nchannel that illustrates how the enzyme functions in 5'-3' exoribonucleolytic mode and how it can function as an endonuclease. A second, negatively charged tunnel leads from the active site, and is ideally located to evacuate the cleaved nucleotide in 5'-3' exonucleolytic mode. We show that B. subtilis RNase J1, which shows processive behavior on long RNAs, behaves distributively for substrates less than 5 nucleotides in length. We propose a model involving the binding of the RNA to the surface of the \u03b2-CASP domain to explain the enzyme's processive action. Examining the Protein Interactome and Subcellular Localization of RNase J2 Complexes in Streptococcus mutans. Regulated RNA turnover is vital for the control of gene expression in all cellular life. In Escherichia coli, this process is largely controlled by a stable degradosome complex containing RNase E and a variety of additional enzymes. In the Firmicutes phylum, species lack RNase E and often\nof non-coding RNA. RNase J1 and J2 co-purify as a heteromeric complex and there is recent evidence that they interact with other enzymes to form a bacterial RNA degradosome. Finally, we speculate on the evolutionary origin of \u03b2-CASP ribonucleases and on their functions in Archaea. Orthologs of CPSF73 with endo- and exo-ribonuclease activity are strictly conserved throughout the archaea suggesting a role for these enzymes in the maturation and/or degradation of messenger RNA. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: RNA Decay mechanisms. Proteomic and transcriptomic experiments reveal an essential role of RNA degradosome complexes in shaping the transcriptome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The phenotypic adjustments of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are commonly inferred from the analysis of transcript abundance. While mechanisms of transcriptional regulation have been extensively analysed in mycobacteria, little is known about mechanisms that shape the transcriptome by regulating RNA decay rates.

Here, we show that this trapping is prevented by coassembly of the N-type \u03b1-subunits with intra-subfamily delayed rectifier \u03b1-subunits. Extra-subfamily delayed rectifier \u03b1-subunits, regardless of their capacity to interact with KCNE1 and KCNE2, cannot rescue Kv1.4 or Kv3.4 surface expression unless engineered to interact with them using N-terminal A and B domain swapping. The KCNE1/2-enforced checkpoint ensures N-type \u03b1-subunits only reach the cell surface as part of intra-subfamily mixed-\u03b1 complexes, thereby governing channel composition, inactivation rate, and-by extension-cellular excitability. Structural and functional characterization of Kv6.2 a new gamma-subunit of voltage-gated potassium channel. We have cloned and functionally expressed Kv6.2, a new member of the Kv6 subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channel subunits. The human Kv6.2 (KCNF2) gene was mapped at 18q22-18q23. Kv6.2 mRNA is preferentially expressed in\nand Kvbeta1.2 subunits regulate the proportion of wild-type Kv1.4-1.1 channels that are available to open. Furthermore, EA1 mutations alter heteromeric channel availability which probably modifies the integration properties and firing patterns of neurones controlling cognitive processes and body movements. miR-448 regulates potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 4 (KCNA4) in ischemia and heart failure. BACKGROUND: MicroRNA miR-448 mediates some of the effects of ischemia on arrhythmic risk. Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 4 (KCNA4) encodes a Kv1.4 current that opens in response to membrane depolarization and is essential for regulating the action potential duration in heart. KCNA4 has a miR-448 binding site.OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether miR-448 was involved in the regulation of KCNA4 messenger RNA expression in ischemia.METHODS: Quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to investigate the expression of KCNA4 and miR-448. Pull-down assays were used to examine the interaction between miR-448 and KCNA4. miR-448 decoy and\nmonkey FKBP51 in which either FK1 or FK2 was deleted lacked GR inhibitory activity. Thus, the potent inhibitory activity of squirrel monkey FKBP51 involves both FK domains and the heat shock protein 90-binding TPR domain. KCNE1 and KCNE2 provide a checkpoint governing voltage-gated potassium channel \u03b1-subunit composition. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) currents generated by N-type \u03b1-subunit homotetramers inactivate rapidly because an N-terminal ball domain blocks the channel pore after activation. Hence, the inactivation rate of heterotetrameric channels comprising both N-type and non-N-type (delayed rectifier) \u03b1-subunits depends upon the number of N-type \u03b1-subunits in the complex. As Kv channel inactivation and inactivation recovery rates regulate cellular excitability, the composition and expression of these heterotetrameric complexes are expected to be tightly regulated. In a companion article, we showed that the single transmembrane segment ancillary (\u03b2) subunits KCNE1 and KCNE2 suppress currents generated by homomeric Kv1.4, Kv3.3, and Kv3.4 channels, by trapping them early\nmodulating trafficking, surface expression and channel gating. Voltage-dependent potassium channels (Kv) play a crucial role in the activation and proliferation of leukocytes. Kv channels are either homo- or hetero-oligomers. This composition modulates their surface expression and serves as a mechanism for regulating channel activity. Kv channel interaction with accessory subunits provides mechanisms for channels to respond to stimuli beyond changes in membrane potential. Here, we demonstrate that KCNE4 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E member 4), but not KCNE2, functions as an inhibitory Kv1.3 partner in leukocytes. Kv1.3 trafficking, targeting and activity are altered by the presence of KCNE4. KCNE4 decreases current density, slows activation, accelerates inactivation, increases cumulative inactivation, retains Kv1.3 in the ER and impairs channel targeting to lipid raft microdomains. KCNE4 associates with Kv1.3 in the ER and decreases the number of Kv1.3 channels at the cell surface, which diminishes cell excitability. Kv1.3 and KCNE4 are differentially regulated\nand immunofluorescence analyses revealed this suppression is due to KCNE1 and KCNE2 retaining Kv1.4 and Kv3.4 intracellularly, early in the secretory pathway. The retention is specific, requires \u03b1-\u03b2 coassembly, and does not involve the dynamin-dependent endocytosis pathway. However, the small fraction of Kv3.4 that escapes KCNE-dependent retention is regulated by dynamin-dependent endocytosis. The findings illustrate two contrasting mechanisms controlling surface expression of N-type Kv \u03b1-subunits and therefore, potentially, cellular excitability and refractory periods. Time- and voltage-dependent modulation of a Kv1.4 channel by a beta-subunit (Kv beta 3) cloned from ferret ventricle. In mammals, voltage-gated K+ channels can be made of complexes containing alpha-subunits similar to the Shaker K+ channel and smaller cytoplasmic beta-subunits. Recent studies have suggested that these ancillary beta-subunits can modulate K+ channel gating properties. We studied the effects of a K+ channel beta-subunit, Kv beta 3, coexpressed with a Kv1.4 alpha-subunit, FK1, on the time and voltage\ndiversity of potassium channels found in the cardiovascular system. Identification of an evolutionarily conserved extracellular threonine residue critical for surface expression and its potential coupling of adjacent voltage-sensing and gating domains in voltage-gated potassium channels. The dynamic expression of voltage-gated potassium channels (Kvs) at the cell surface is a fundamental factor controlling membrane excitability. In exploring possible mechanisms controlling Kv surface expression, we identified a region in the extracellular linker between the first and second of the six (S1-S6) transmembrane-spanning domains of the Kv1.4 channel, which we hypothesized to be critical for its biogenesis. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, patch clamp electrophysiology, and mutagenesis, we identified a single threonine residue at position 330 within the Kv1.4 S1-S2 linker that is absolutely required for cell surface expression. Mutation of Thr-330 to an alanine, aspartate, or lysine prevented surface expression. However, surface expression occurred upon co-expression of mutant and wild type Kv1.4\nventricular myocardium. KCNE1 and KCNE2 inhibit forward trafficking of homomeric N-type voltage-gated potassium channels. Potassium currents generated by voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels comprising \u03b1-subunits from the Kv1, 2, and 3 subfamilies facilitate high-frequency firing of mammalian neurons. Within these subfamilies, only three \u03b1-subunits (Kv1.4, Kv3.3, and Kv3.4) generate currents that decay rapidly in the open state because an N-terminal ball domain blocks the channel pore after activation-a process termed N-type inactivation. Despite its importance to shaping cellular excitability, little is known of the processes regulating surface expression of N-type \u03b1-subunits, versus their slowly inactivating (delayed rectifier) counterparts. Here we found that currents generated by homomeric Kv1.4, Kv3.3, and Kv3.4 channels are all strongly suppressed by the single transmembrane domain ancillary (\u03b2) subunits KCNE1 and KCNE2. A combination of electrophysiological, biochemical, and immunofluorescence analyses revealed this suppression is due to KCNE1 and KCNE2 retaining Kv1.4 and Kv3.4 intracellularly, early in the\nKv1.4) were created by coinjection of cRNAs in oocytes. Multimeric channels consisting of Kv1.4:Kv1.1, Kv1.4:Kv1.2, and Kv1.4:Kv1.5 were expressed and compared. The hybrid channels displayed characteristics of heterotetrameric channels with kinetics that more closely resembled a native cardiac transient outward current. The inactivation and recovery from inactivation of the heteromeric channels indicated that the presence of a single inactivating subunit (Kv1.4) was probably sufficient to cause channel inactivation. The results demonstrate that expression of different K+ channel genes can produce channel protein subunits that assemble as heteromultimers with unique properties. It is shown that certain combinations of voltage-gated K+ channels probably do not contribute to native transient outward current. However, one combination of subunits could not be excluded. Therefore, this mechanism of channel assembly may underlie some of the functional diversity of potassium channels found in the cardiovascular system. Identification of an evolutionarily conserved extracellular threonine residue critical for surface\nthat Kv beta 3 alters channel states which follow activation. Episodic ataxia type 1 mutations in the KCNA1 gene impair the fast inactivation properties of the human potassium channels Kv1.4-1.1/Kvbeta1.1 and Kv1.4-1.1/Kvbeta1.2. Episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) is an autosomal dominant neurological disorder characterized by constant muscle rippling movements (myokymia) and episodic attacks of ataxia. Several heterozygous point mutations have been found in the coding sequence of the voltage-gated potassium channel gene KCNA1 (hKv1.1), which alter the delayed-rectifier function of the channel. Shaker-like channels of different cell types may be formed by unique hetero-oligomeric complexes comprising Kv1.1, Kv1.4 and Kvbeta1.x subunits. Here we show that the human Kvbeta1.1 and Kvbeta1.2 subunits modulated the functional properties of tandemly linked Kv1.4-1.1 wild-type channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes by (i) increasing the rate and amount of N-type inactivation, (ii) slowing the recovery rate from inactivation, (iii) accelerating the cumulative inactivation of the\neffects of a K+ channel beta-subunit, Kv beta 3, coexpressed with a Kv1.4 alpha-subunit, FK1, on the time and voltage dependence of channel activation, inactivation, recovery from inactivation, and deactivation, using an oocyte expression system. Kv beta 3 was found to accelerate both the fast and the slow component of Kv1.4 inactivation. Kv beta 3 also altered the relative contributions of the two components of inactivation by increasing the contribution of the slow component to the inactivation process. Kv beta 3 slowed recovery from inactivation for Kv1.4, but not for a Kv1.4 deletion mutant lacking N-type inactivation. Finally, steady-state activation and the time course of Kv1.4 current activation were not strongly influenced by Kv beta 3; however, deactivation was slowed in the presence of Kv beta 3. This study suggests that Kv beta 3 alters channel states which follow activation. Episodic ataxia type 1 mutations in the KCNA1 gene impair\nKv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels in developmental perspective. Kv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels consist of two types of \u03b1-subunits: (a) electrically-active Kcnb1 \u03b1-subunits and (b) silent or modulatory \u03b1-subunits plus \u03b2-subunits that, similar to silent \u03b1-subunits, also regulate electrically-active subunits. Voltage-gated potassium channels were traditionally viewed, mainly by electrophysiologists, as regulators of the electrical activity of the plasma membrane in excitable cells, a role that is performed by transmembrane protein domains of \u03b1-subunits that form the electric pore. Genetic studies revealed a role for this region of \u03b1-subunits of voltage-gated potassium channels in human neurodevelopmental disorders, such as epileptic encephalopathy. The N- and C-terminal domains of \u03b1-subunits interact to form the cytoplasmic subunit of heterotetrameric potassium channels that regulate electric pores. Subsequent animal studies revealed the developmental functions of Kcnb1-containing voltage-gated potassium channels and illustrated their role during brain development and reproduction. These functions of potassium channels are discussed in this review\nserves to interlock the voltage-sensing and gating domains of adjacent monomers, thereby yielding a structure competent for the surface expression of functional tetramers. Impact of ancillary subunits on ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels generate the outward K(+) ion currents that constitute the primary force in ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium channels comprise tetramers of pore-forming alpha subunits and, in probably most cases in vivo, ancillary or beta subunits that help define the properties of the Kv current generated. Ancillary subunits can be broadly categorized as cytoplasmic or transmembrane and can modify Kv channel trafficking, conductance, gating, ion selectivity, regulation, and pharmacology. Because of their often profound effects on Kv channel function, studies of the molecular correlates of ventricular repolarization must take into account ancillary subunits as well as alpha subunits. Cytoplasmic ancillary subunits include the Kv beta subunits, which regulate a range of Kv channels and may link channel gating\nin outer retina, rod inner segments, hippocampus and concentrated in axonal membranes.CONCLUSION: KCNA4 (Kv1.4) is implicated in a novel syndrome characterised by striatal thinning, congenital cataract and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Our study highlights potassium channels' role in ocular and neuronal genetics. Heteromultimeric assembly of human potassium channels. Molecular basis of a transient outward current? To gain insight into the molecular basis of cardiac repolarization, we have expressed K+ channels cloned from ventricular myocardium in Xenopus oocytes. A recently identified human cardiac K+ channel isoform (human Kv1.4) has properties similar to the 4-aminopyridine-sensitive calcium-insensitive component of the cardiac transient outward current. However, these channels recovered from inactivation much slower than native channels. Hybrid channels consisting of subunits from different K+ channel clones (delayed rectifier channels [Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.5] and Kv1.4) were created by coinjection of cRNAs in oocytes. Multimeric channels consisting of Kv1.4:Kv1.1, Kv1.4:Kv1.2, and Kv1.4:Kv1.5 were expressed and\ncardiac Kv channels such as KCNQ1 and hERG in vivo are under debate. MiRP1 alters hERG function and pharmacology, and inherited MiRP1 mutations are associated with inherited and acquired arrhythmias, but controversy exists over the native role of MiRP1 in regulating hERG (and therefore ventricular I(Kr)) in vivo. Some ancillary subunits may exhibit varied expression to shape spatial Kv current variation, for example, KChIP2 and the epicardial-endocardial I(to) current density gradient. Indeed, it is likely that most native ventricular Kv channels exhibit temporal and spatial heterogeneity of subunit composition, complicating both modeling of their functional impact on the ventricular action potential and design of specific current-targeted compounds. Here, we discuss current thinking and lines of experimentation aimed at resolving the complexities of the Kv channel complexes that repolarize the human ventricular myocardium. KCNE1 and KCNE2 inhibit forward trafficking of homomeric N-type voltage-gated potassium channels. Potassium currents generated by voltage-gated potassium\nexpression of KCNA4 and miR-448. Pull-down assays were used to examine the interaction between miR-448 and KCNA4. miR-448 decoy and binding site mutation were used to examine the specificity of the effect for KCNA4.RESULTS: The expression of KCNA4 is diminished in ischemia and human heart failure tissues with ventricular tachycardia. Previously, we have shown that miR-448 is upregulated in ischemia and inhibition can prevent arrhythmic risk after myocardial infarction. The 3'-untranslated region of KCNA4 has a conserved miR-448 binding site. miR-448 bound to this site directly and reduced KCNA4 expression and the transient outward potassium current. Inhibition of miR-448 restored KCNA4.CONCLUSION: These findings showed a link between Kv1.4 downregulation and miR-448-mediated upregulation in ischemia, suggesting a new mechanism for the antiarrhythmic effect of miR-448 inhibition. KCNE4 suppresses Kv1.3 currents by modulating trafficking, surface expression and channel gating. Voltage-dependent potassium channels (Kv) play a crucial role in the activation and proliferation\nof voltage-gated potassium channel subunits. The human Kv6.2 (KCNF2) gene was mapped at 18q22-18q23. Kv6.2 mRNA is preferentially expressed in rat and human myocard. Rat and human Kv6.2 subunits appear to be unable to form functional Kv channels in a heterologous expression system, but, when coexpressed with Kv2.1 alpha subunits, heteromultimeric Kv channels were formed mediating voltage-activated delayed-rectifier type outward currents. Their kinetics and conductance-voltage relationship were different from those mediated by homomultimeric Kv2.1 channels. Yeast two-hybrid reporter assays indicated that Kv6.2 amino-termini are able to interact specifically with the Kv2.1 amino-terminus. It is proposed that this protein protein interaction underlies Kv2.1/Kv6.2 subunit assembly and the expression of functional heteromultimeric Kv2.1/Kv6.2 channels. The most resiliant feature of the Kv2.1/Kv6.2 channels was their submicromolar sensitivity to the antiarrhythmic drug propafenone. The data suggest that delayed-rectifier type channels containing Kv6.2 subunits may contribute to cardiac action potential repolarization. KCNA4 deficiency leads to\nrate and amount of N-type inactivation, (ii) slowing the recovery rate from inactivation, (iii) accelerating the cumulative inactivation of the channel and (iv) negatively shifting the voltage dependence of inactivation. To date, the role of the human Kv1.4-1.1, Kv1.4-1.1/Kvbeta1.1 and Kv1.4-1.1/Kvbeta1.2 channels in the aetiopathogenesis of EA1 has not been investigated. Here we also show that the EA1 mutations E325D, V404I and V408A, which line the ion-conducting pore, and I177N, which resides within the S1 segment, alter the fast inactivation and repriming properties of the channels by decreasing both the rate and degree of N-type inactivation and by accelerating the recovery from fast inactivation. Furthermore, the E325D, V404I and I177N mutations shifted the voltage dependence of the steady-state inactivation to more positive potentials. The results demonstrate that the human Kvbeta1.1 and Kvbeta1.2 subunits regulate the proportion of wild-type Kv1.4-1.1 channels that are available to open. Furthermore, EA1 mutations alter heteromeric\ndata suggest that delayed-rectifier type channels containing Kv6.2 subunits may contribute to cardiac action potential repolarization. KCNA4 deficiency leads to a syndrome of abnormal striatum, congenital cataract and intellectual disability. BACKGROUND: Voltage-gated potassium channels are highly diverse proteins representing the most complex class of voltage-gated ion channels from structural and functional perspectives. Deficiency of these channels usually results in various human disorders.OBJECTIVES: To describe a novel autosomal recessive syndrome associated with KCNA4 deficiency leading to congenital cataract, abnormal striatum, intellectual disability and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.METHODS: We used SNP arrays, linkage analyses, autozygosity mapping, whole-exome sequencing, RT-PCR and two-electrode voltage-clamp recording.RESULTS: We identified a missense variant (p.Arg89Gln) in KCNA4 in four patients from a consanguineous family manifesting a novel syndrome of congenital cataract, abnormal striatum, intellectual disability and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The variant was fully segregated with the disease and absent in 747 ethnically matched exomes. Xenopus oocytes were\nCytoplasmic ancillary subunits include the Kv beta subunits, which regulate a range of Kv channels and may link channel gating to redox potential, and the KChIPs, which appear most often associated with Kv4 subfamily channels that generate the ventricular I(to) current. Transmembrane ancillary subunits include the MinK-related proteins (MiRPs) encoded by KCNE genes, which modulate members of most Kv alpha subunit subfamilies, and the putative 12-transmembrane domain KCR1 protein, which modulates hERG. In some cases, such as the ventricular I(Ks) channel complex, it is well established that the KCNQ1 alpha subunit must coassemble with the MinK (KCNE1) single-transmembrane domain ancillary subunit for recapitulation of the characteristic, unusually slowly-activating I(Ks) current. In other cases, it is not so clear-cut, and in particular, the roles of the other MiRPs (1-4) in regulating cardiac Kv channels such as KCNQ1 and hERG in vivo are under debate. MiRP1 alters hERG function and pharmacology, and\nhyperactivity disorder. The variant was fully segregated with the disease and absent in 747 ethnically matched exomes. Xenopus oocytes were injected with human Kv1.4 wild-type mRNA, R89Q and WT/R89Q channels. The wild type had mean current amplitude that was significantly greater than those recorded from the cells expressing the same amount of mutant mRNA. Co-expression of the wild type and mutant mRNAs resulted in mean current amplitude that was significantly different from that of the wild type. RT-PCR indicated that KCNA4 is present in mouse brain, lens and retina. KCNA4 interacts with several molecules including synaptotagmin I, DLG1 and DLG2. The channel co-localises with cholinergic amacrine and rod bipolar cells in rats and is widely distributed in the central nervous system. Based on previous studies, the channel is highly expressed in outer retina, rod inner segments, hippocampus and concentrated in axonal membranes.CONCLUSION: KCNA4 (Kv1.4) is implicated in a novel syndrome",

Taken together, these data suggest that phosphorylation of the beta4 subunit dynamically regulates the functional coupling between the beta4 subunit and the pore-forming alpha subunit of the slo channel. In addition, phosphorylation of different residues in hbeta4 differentially influences its effects on slo channel activation kinetics, deactivation kinetics, and voltage dependence. Cross-linking of charybdotoxin to high-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels: identification of the covalently modified toxin residue. High-conductance calcium-activated potassium (maxi-K) channels are composed of two subunits, alpha and beta. The pore-forming alpha subunit is a member of the mSlo family of K+ channels, whereas the beta subunit is a novel protein that modulates the biophysical and pharmacological properties of the channel complex. In the presence of a bifunctional cross-linking reagent, monoiodotyrosine charybdotoxin ([125I]ChTX) is covalently incorporated specifically into Lys69 of the beta subunit, which is located in a large extracellular loop of this protein. Using variants of ChTX\net al., 1994), our data constrain the maximum distance between the pore of this channel and the region in the extracellular loop of the beta subunit where the cross-linking reaction takes place to 11 A. This topological limit helps define structural features of the maxi-K channel that may aide in probing the functional interaction between alpha and beta subunits of the channel complex. Identification and functional characterization of cereblon as a binding protein for large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel in rat brain. Large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BK(Ca)) channels are activated by membrane depolarization and modulated by intracellular Ca2+. Here, we report the direct interaction of cereblon (CRBN) with the cytosolic carboxy-terminus of the BK(Ca) channel alpha subunit (Slo). Rat CRBN contained the N-terminal domain of the Lon protease, a 'regulators of G protein-signaling' (RGS)-like domain, a leucine zipper (LZ) motif, and four putative protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation sites. RNA messages of\nintegrins, suggesting that this physical association underlies the functional interaction between these molecules. Together, these data outline a new signaling mechanism by which KCa1.1 regulates \u03b21-integrin function and therefore invasiveness of RA-FLSs.-Tanner, M. R., Pennington, M. W., Laragione, T., Gulko, P. S., Beeton, C. KCa1.1 channels regulate \u03b21-integrin function and cell adhesion in rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes. Functional and molecular evidence of MaxiK channel beta1 subunit decrease with coronary artery ageing in the rat. Large-conductance, voltage- and Ca2+ -activated K+ channels (MaxiK, BK) are key regulators of vascular tone. Vascular MaxiK are formed by the pore-forming alpha subunit and the modulatory beta1 subunit, which imprints unique kinetics, Ca2+/voltage sensitivities and pharmacology to the channel. As age progresses, alpha subunit functional expression and protein levels diminish in coronary myocytes. However, whether ageing modifies beta1 subunit expression or the mechanism of alpha subunit reduction is unknown. Thus, we examined functional and pharmacological\ncolocalization in HEK293T cells. We propose that MaxiK channels via direct c-Src-dependent phosphorylation play a significant role supporting vasoconstriction after activation of G protein-coupled receptors by vasoactive substances and neurotransmitters. Functional effects of auxiliary beta4-subunit on rat large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel. Large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK(Ca)) channels are composed of the pore-forming alpha-subunit and the auxiliary beta-subunits. The beta4-subunit is dominantly expressed in the mammalian central nervous system. To understand the physiological roles of the beta4-subunit on the BK(Ca) channel alpha-subunit (Slo), we isolated a full-length complementary DNA of rat beta4-subunit (rbeta4), expressed heterolgously in Xenopus oocytes, and investigated the detailed functional effects using electrophysiological means. When expressed together with rat Slo (rSlo), rbeta4 profoundly altered the gating characteristics of the Slo channel. At a given concentration of intracellular Ca(2+), rSlo/rbeta4 channels were more sensitive to transmembrane voltage changes. The activation and deactivation rates of macroscopic currents were decreased in a\nby occluding its K+-conducting pore resembling the inactivation caused by the \"ball\" peptide in voltage-dependent K+ channels. Thus, the inactivating phenotype of MaxiK channels in native tissues can result from the association with different beta subunits. Phosphorylation-dependent functional coupling of hSlo calcium-dependent potassium channel and its hbeta 4 subunit. The auxiliary beta4 subunit of the human slowpoke calciumdependent potassium (slo) channel is expressed predominantly in the brain. Co-expression of beta4 subunit with the slo channel alpha subunit in HEK293 and Chinese hamster ovary cells slows channel activation and deactivation and also shifts the voltage dependence of the channel to more depolarized potentials. We show here that the functional interaction between the hbeta4 subunit and the slo channel is influenced by the phosphorylation state of hbeta4. Treatment of cells with okadaic acid (OA) reduces the effect of hbeta4 on slo channel activation kinetics and voltage dependence but not on slo channel\ninteraction of these mechanisms may be one method for fine-tuning potassium channel activity in response to various physiological and pathological challenges. 2. The most prevalent K+ channels in vascular smooth muscle are large-conductance calcium- and voltage-sensitive channels (maxi-K channels) and voltage-gated channels (Kv channels). Both channel types are complex molecular structures consisting of a pore-forming alpha-subunit and an ancillary beta-subunit. The maxi-K and Kv channel alpha-subunits assemble as tetramers and have S4 transmembrane domains that represent the putative voltage sensor. While most vascular smooth muscle cells identified to date contain both maxi-K and Kv channels, the expression of individual alpha-subunit isoforms and beta-subunit association occurs in a tissue-specific manner, thereby providing functional specificity. 3. The maxi-K channel alpha-subunit derives its molecular diversity by alternative splicing of a single-gene transcript to yield multiple isoforms that differ in their sensitivity to intracellular Ca2+ and voltage, cell surface expression and post- translational modification.\nendocytic trafficking signals. Voltage-dependent and calcium-activated K(+) (MaxiK, BK) channels are ubiquitously expressed and have various physiological roles including regulation of neurotransmitter release and smooth muscle tone. Coexpression of the pore-forming alpha (hSlo) subunit of MaxiK channels with a regulatory beta1 subunit (KCNMB1) produces noninactivating currents that are distinguished by high voltage/Ca(2+) sensitivities and altered pharmacology [McManus OB, Helms LM, Pallanck L, Ganetzky B, Swanson R, Leonard RJ (1995) Functional role of the beta subunit of high conductance calcium-activated potassium channels. Neuron 14:645-650; Wallner M, Meera P, Ottolia M, Kaczorowski G, Latorre R, Garcia ML, Stefani E, Toro L (1995) Characterization of and modulation by a beta-subunit of a human maxi K(Ca) channel cloned from myometrium. Receptors Channels 3:185-199]. We now show that beta1 can regulate hSlo traffic as well, resulting in decreased hSlo surface expression. beta1 subunit expressed alone is able to reach the plasma membrane; in addition, it\nto tailor K+ channel functional properties and expression levels. Many auxiliary subunits have been identified for mammalian Slo1, a high-conductance K+ channel gated by voltage and Ca2+. Experiments with heterologous expression systems show that some of the identified Slo1 auxiliary subunits can also regulate other Slo K+ channels. However, it is unclear whether a single auxiliary subunit may regulate more than one Slo channel in native tissues. BKIP-1, an auxiliary subunit of C. elegans SLO-1, facilitates SLO-1 membrane trafficking and regulates SLO-1 function in neurons and muscle cells. Here we show that BKIP-1 also serves as an auxiliary subunit of C. elegans SLO-2, a high-conductance K+ channel gated by membrane voltage and cytosolic Cl- and Ca2+. Comparisons of whole-cell and single-channel SLO-2 currents in native neurons and muscle cells between worm strains with and without BKIP-1 suggest that BKIP-1 reduces chloride sensitivity, activation rate, and single-channel open probability of SLO-2.\nadhesion in rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes. Large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (KCa1.1; BK, Slo1, MaxiK, KCNMA1) is the predominant potassium channel expressed at the plasma membrane of rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs) isolated from the synovium of patients with RA. It is a critical regulator of RA-FLS migration and invasion and therefore represents an attractive target for the therapy of RA. However, the molecular mechanisms by which KCa1.1 regulates RA-FLS invasiveness have remained largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that KCa1.1 regulates RA-FLS adhesion through controlling the plasma membrane expression and activation of \u03b21 integrins, but not \u03b14, \u03b15, or \u03b16 integrins. Blocking KCa1.1 disturbs calcium homeostasis, leading to the sustained phosphorylation of Akt and the recruitment of talin to \u03b21 integrins. Interestingly, the pore-forming \u03b1 subunit of KCa1.1 coimmunoprecipitates with \u03b21 integrins, suggesting that this physical association underlies the functional interaction between these molecules. Together, these data outline a new signaling\nof SV1 inhibited surface expression of alpha and beta1 subunits approximately 80% by trapping them in the ER. This inhibition seems to be specific for MaxiK channel subunits since SV1 was unable to prevent surface expression of the Kv4.3 channel or to interact with green fluorescent protein. These results indicate a dominant-negative role of SV1 in MaxiK channel expression. Moreover, they reveal down-regulation by splice variants as a new mechanism that may contribute to the diverse levels of MaxiK channel expression in non-excitable and excitable cells. Molecular basis of fast inactivation in voltage and Ca2+-activated K+ channels: a transmembrane beta-subunit homolog. Voltage-dependent and calcium-sensitive K+ (MaxiK) channels are key regulators of neuronal excitability, secretion, and vascular tone because of their ability to sense transmembrane voltage and intracellular Ca2+. In most tissues, their stimulation results in a noninactivating hyperpolarizing K+ current that reduces excitability. In addition to noninactivating MaxiK currents, an\nresulting in decreased hSlo surface expression. beta1 subunit expressed alone is able to reach the plasma membrane; in addition, it exhibits a distinct intracellular punctated pattern that colocalizes with an endosomal marker. Coexpressing beta1 subunit with hSlo, switches hSlo's rather diffuse intracellular expression to a punctate cytoplasmic localization that overlaps beta1 expression. Furthermore, coexpressed beta1 subunit reduces steady-state hSlo surface expression. Site-directed mutagenesis underscores a role of a putative endocytic signal at the beta1 C-terminus in the control of hSlo surface expression. We propose that aside from its well-established role as regulator of hSlo electrical activity, beta1 can regulate hSlo expression levels by means of an endocytic mechanism. This highlights a new beta1 subunit feature that regulates hSlo channels by a trafficking mechanism. KCa1.1 channels regulate \u03b21-integrin function and cell adhesion in rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes. Large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (KCa1.1; BK, Slo1, MaxiK, KCNMA1) is the predominant potassium channel\nassembled of alpha- and beta1-subunits. The presence of the beta1-subunit confers MaxiK with higher Ca(2+)/voltage sensitivity, which makes this channel an efficient tuner of smooth muscle functions in physiological conditions. The enhanced smooth muscle mechanical activities in mice lacking the beta1-subunit gene support the principal role of this channel molecular component in tissue and whole animal functions. In this review, we discuss MaxiK channel roles as a tuner of smooth muscle contractility, especially focusing attention on the modulatory beta1-subunit. MaxiK channel interactome reveals its interaction with GABA transporter 3 and heat shock protein 60 in the mammalian brain. Large conductance voltage and calcium-activated potassium (MaxiK) channels are activated by membrane depolarization and elevated cytosolic Ca(2+). In the brain, they localize to neurons and astrocytes, where they play roles such as resetting the membrane potential during an action potential, neurotransmitter release, and neurovascular coupling. MaxiK channels are known to associate with\ngiven cell type. Association with a number of the ancillary beta-subunits affects Kv channel function in several ways. Beta-subunits can induce inactivating properties and act as chaperones, thereby regulating channel cell-surface expression and current kinetics. MaxiK channel partners: physiological impact. The basic functional unit of the large-conductance, voltage- and Ca2+-activated K+ (MaxiK, BK, BKCa) channel is a tetramer of the pore-forming alpha-subunit (MaxiKalpha) encoded by a single gene, Slo, holding multiple alternative exons. Depending on the tissue, MaxiKalpha can associate with modulatory beta-subunits (beta1-beta4) increasing its functional diversity. As MaxiK senses and regulates membrane voltage and intracellular Ca2+, it links cell excitability with cell signalling and metabolism. Thus, MaxiK is a key regulator of vital body functions, like blood flow, uresis, immunity and neurotransmission. Epilepsy with paroxysmal dyskinesia syndrome has been recognized as a MaxiKalpha-related disorder caused by a gain-of-function C-terminus mutation. This channel region is also emerging as a\na key molecule which tunes muscle mechanical activity. The MaxiK channel is the large-conductance, voltage-dependent, and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel. This channel is almost ubiquitously distributed among mammalian tissues including smooth muscles. The ability of MaxiK to work as a rheostat fine tuning membrane potential and intracellular Ca(2+) enables it to mediate opposite functions: it facilitates contraction, but also acts as a negative feedback mechanism to restore tone after a contraction cycle. MaxiK activation mediates relaxations to a variety of physiological substances, whereas its inhibition plays a significant role in contractile responses. At the molecular level, MaxiK is a protein complex formed by at least two integral dissimilar membrane subunits, the pore-forming alpha-subunit and a regulatory beta-subunit. In smooth muscles, beta1 is the predominant subunit and most MaxiK seem to be assembled of alpha- and beta1-subunits. The presence of the beta1-subunit confers MaxiK with higher Ca(2+)/voltage sensitivity, which makes this channel\ntissues, their stimulation results in a noninactivating hyperpolarizing K+ current that reduces excitability. In addition to noninactivating MaxiK currents, an inactivating MaxiK channel phenotype is found in cells like chromaffin cells and hippocampal neurons. The molecular determinants underlying inactivating MaxiK channels remain unknown. Herein, we report a transmembrane beta subunit (beta2) that yields inactivating MaxiK currents on coexpression with the pore-forming alpha subunit of MaxiK channels. Intracellular application of trypsin as well as deletion of 19 N-terminal amino acids of the beta2 subunit abolished inactivation of the alpha subunit. Conversely, fusion of these N-terminal amino acids to the noninactivating smooth muscle beta1 subunit leads to an inactivating phenotype of MaxiK channels. Furthermore, addition of a synthetic N-terminal peptide of the beta2 subunit causes inactivation of the MaxiK channel alpha subunit by occluding its K+-conducting pore resembling the inactivation caused by the \"ball\" peptide in voltage-dependent K+ channels. Thus, the inactivating\nprotein-signaling' (RGS)-like domain, a leucine zipper (LZ) motif, and four putative protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation sites. RNA messages of rat cereblon (rCRBN) were widely distributed in different tissues with especially high-levels of expression in the brain. Direct association of rCRBN with the BK(Ca) channel was confirmed by immunoprecipitation in brain lysate, and the two proteins were co-localized in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Ionic currents evoked by the rSlo channel were dramatically suppressed upon coexpression of rCRBN. rCRBN decreased the formation of the tetrameric rSlo complex thus reducing the surface expression of functional channels. Therefore, we suggest that CRBN may play an important role in assembly and surface expression of functional BK(Ca) channels by direct interaction with the cytosolic C-terminus of its alpha-subunit. Beta1-subunit of MaxiK channel in smooth muscle: a key molecule which tunes muscle mechanical activity. The MaxiK channel is the large-conductance, voltage-dependent, and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel. This\nageing modifies beta1 subunit expression or the mechanism of alpha subunit reduction is unknown. Thus, we examined functional and pharmacological characteristics of MaxiK, as well as alpha and beta1 transcript levels in coronary myocytes from young and old F344 rats. The mechanism of age-dependent alpha subunit protein reduction involves its transcript downregulation. A corresponding loss of beta1 transcripts was also detected in old myocytes, suggesting a proportional age-dependent decrease of beta1 to alpha subunit protein. Indeed, MaxiK channel properties, defined by coassembly of beta1 and alpha subunits, were equivalent in young versus old, for example in terms of (i) activation kinetics, (ii) sensitivity to Ca2+ levels > 1 microm (iii) dehydrosoyasaponin-I-induced activation, and (iv) iberiotoxin blockade. Consistent with less MaxiK expression/function in older myocytes, the ability of iberiotoxin to contract coronary rings was reduced approximately 50% with ageing confirming our previous findings. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) contractile efficacy was reduced by iberiotoxin\nbeen recognized as a MaxiKalpha-related disorder caused by a gain-of-function C-terminus mutation. This channel region is also emerging as a key recognition module containing sequences for MaxiKalpha interaction with its surrounding signalling partners, and its targeting to cell-specific microdomains. The growing list of interacting proteins highlights the possibility that associations with the C-terminus of MaxiKalpha are dynamic and depending on each cellular environment. We speculate that the molecular multiplicity of the C-terminus (and intracellular loops) dictated by alternative exons may modulate or create additional interacting sites in a tissue-specific manner. A challenge is the dissection of MaxiK macromolecular signalling complexes in different tissues and their temporal association/dissociation according to the stimulus. BKIP-1, an auxiliary subunit critical to SLO-1 function, inhibits SLO-2 potassium channel in vivo. Auxiliary subunits are often needed to tailor K+ channel functional properties and expression levels. Many auxiliary subunits have been identified for mammalian Slo1, a high-conductance\nyield multiple isoforms that differ in their sensitivity to intracellular Ca2+ and voltage, cell surface expression and post- translational modification. The ability of this channel to assemble as a homo- or heterotetramer allows for fine-tuning control to intracellular regulators. Another level of diversity for this channel is in its association with accessory beta-subunits. Multiple beta-subunits have been identified that can arise either from separate genes or alternative splicing of a beta-subunit gene. The maxi-K channel beta-subunits modulate the channel's Ca2+ and voltage sensitivity and kinetic and pharmacological properties. 4. The Kv channel alpha-subunit derives its diverse nature by the expression of several genes. Similar to the maxi-K channel, this channel has been shown to assemble as a homo- and heterotetramer, which can significantly change the Kv current phenotype in a given cell type. Association with a number of the ancillary beta-subunits affects Kv channel function in several ways. Beta-subunits can\ncoronary rings was reduced approximately 50% with ageing confirming our previous findings. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) contractile efficacy was reduced by iberiotoxin pretreatment in young > old coronary arteries (explained by larger iberiotoxin-induced contraction and decreased dynamic range for 5-HT contraction in young versus old) with no apparent differences in nitroglycerine-induced relaxation. We propose that the age-related MaxiK reduction involves a parallel decrease of alpha and beta1 functional expression via a transcript downregulatory mechanism; a major impact on basal and possibly stimulated coronary contraction may contribute to altered coronary flow regulation and coronary morbidity in the elderly.

The notion that a major function of MutS2 is to elicit RQC provides a plausible explanation for the strong co-occurrence of mutSB and rqcH in bacteria (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 10). Hence, we propose as an alternative name for MutS2, RqcU (RQC-upstream factor). In conclusion, MutS2 is likely to function both as a collision sensor and ribosome splitting factor, although our data does not rule out the possibility that MutS2 promotes splitting indirectly.

The role of this SMR domain-containing protein upstream of eukaryotic RQC turned our attention to the only B. subtilis SMR domain protein, MutS2. MutS2 is a paralog of the conserved DNA mismatch repair factor, MutS. Notably, the MutS domains I and II, which bind DNA and recruit the MutL DNA repair cofactor, respectively, are absent in MutS2 (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). On the other hand, MutS and MutS2 share domains III/IV (levers/clamp) and V (ATPase), which in MutS2 are followed by a C-terminal extension containing a coiled-coil, a KOW domain found in proteins implicated in RNA binding and translation, and a C-terminal endonuclease-active SMR domain with a conserved catalytic Aspartate (Supplementary Fig. 2a).

Previous genetic and biochemical studies from Saccharomyces cerevisiae have identified a critical ribosome-associated quality control complex (RQC) that facilitates resolution of stalled ribosomal complexes. While components of the mammalian RQC have been examined in vitro, a systematic characterization of RQC protein interactions in mammalian cells has yet to be described. Here we utilize both proximity-labeling proteomic approaches, BioID and APEX, and traditional affinity-based strategies to both identify interacting proteins of mammalian RQC members and putative substrates for the RQC resident E3 ligase, Ltn1. Surprisingly, validation studies revealed that a subset of substrates are ubiquitylated by Ltn1 in a regulatory manner that does not result in subsequent substrate degradation.

Ribosome stalling can be detrimental to cellular fitness, among other reasons, for producing aberrant and potentially toxic nascent polypeptides. Bacteria and eukaryotes were initially thought to have evolutionarily unrelated processes for targeting such products of ribosome stalling for degradation\u2014transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA or SsrA) and ribosome-associated quality control (RQC), respectively. More recently, however, it has been discovered that the conserved protein, RqcH, mediates a process in bacteria that is homologous to eukaryotic RQC. There has been great recent interest in understanding how stalled ribosomes are sensed and elicit RQC and other processes (see e.g.,). An emerging notion is that the mRNA location of a stalling site (i.e., at the 3\u2019 end versus at an internal position) confers unique structural features to stalled ribosomal complexes, which in turn dictate alternative\nTwo modes of Cue2-mediated mRNA cleavage with distinct substrate recognition initiate no-go decay. Ribosome collisions are recognized by E3 ubiquitin ligase Hel2/ZNF598, leading to RQC (ribosome-associated quality control) and to endonucleolytic cleavage and degradation of the mRNA termed NGD (no-go decay). NGD in yeast requires the Cue2 endonuclease and occurs in two modes, either coupled to RQC (NGDRQC+) or RQC uncoupled (NGDRQC-). This is mediated by an unknown mechanism of substrate recognition by Cue2. Here, we show that the ubiquitin binding activity of Cue2 is required for NGDRQC- but not for NGDRQC+, and that it involves the first two N-terminal Cue domains. In contrast, Trp122 of Cue2 is crucial for NGDRQC+. Moreover, Mbf1 is required for quality controls by preventing +1 ribosome frameshifting induced by a rare codon staller. We propose that in Cue2-dependent cleavage upstream of the collided ribosomes (NGDRQC-), polyubiquitination of eS7 is recognized by two N-terminal Cue\nprotein families database HRD4/NPL4 is required for the proteasomal processing of ubiquitinated ER proteins Role of a ribosome-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase in protein quality control A comprehensive strategy enabling high-resolution functional analysis of the yeast genome Heat shock response: lessons from mouse knockouts A mouse forward genetics screen identifies LISTERIN as an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in neurodegeneration Ribosome-tethered molecular chaperones: the first line of defense against protein misfolding?

Importantly, the work establishes a role for ribosome collisions in bacterial translational quality control. We identify MutS2 as a factor linked genetically and functionally to translational stress and that acts as a ribosome collision sensor in bacteria. Furthermore, our cryo-EM structure of a disome in complex with MutS2 supports a model in which MutS2 acts in ribosomal rescue by mediating ATP-driven ribosomal subunit splitting itself, via conformational rearrangement similar to the MutS paralog (Fig. 3d). Finally, we present evidence linking MutS2 to functional consequences of ribosomal rescue: i) obstructed 50S subunits were found in the MutS2 co-IP\u2019ed sample (Extended Data Fig. 9); ii) MutS2 acted upstream of Ala-tailing (Fig. 4b,c); iii) ATPase domain mutations\npropose that in Cue2-dependent cleavage upstream of the collided ribosomes (NGDRQC-), polyubiquitination of eS7 is recognized by two N-terminal Cue domains of Cue2. In contrast, for the cleavage within collided ribosomes (NGDRQC+), the UBA domain, Trp122 and the interaction between Mbf1 and uS3 are critical. A Ribosome-Bound Quality Control Complex Triggers Degradation of Nascent Peptides and Signals Translation Stress Summary The conserved transcriptional regulator Heat Shock Factor 1 (Hsf1) is a key sensor of proteotoxic and other stress in the eukaryotic cytosol, yet its regulation is poorly understood. We surveyed Hsf1 activity in a genome-wide loss-of-function library in Saccaromyces cerevisiae as well as ~78,000 double mutants and found Hsf1 activity to be modulated by highly diverse stresses. These included disruption of a ribosome-bound complex we named the Ribosome Quality Control Complex (RQC) comprising the Ltn1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, two highly conserved but poorly characterized proteins (Tae2 and Rqc1), and Cdc48\nfound in select species. It will be interesting to determine if RSR has acquired any distinct function during the evolution of animal species. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors have no conflicting interests.

VLRF1 overlaps with the Rqc2 A-tRNA position and interacts with the ribosomal A-site, projecting its catalytic GSQ motif towards the CCA end of the tRNA, its Y285 residue dislodging the tRNA A73 for nucleolytic cleavage. Moreover, in the pre-state, we found the ABCF-type ATPase Arb1 in the ribosomal E-site, which stabilizes the delocalized A73 of the peptidyl-tRNA and stimulates Vms1-dependent tRNA cleavage. Our structural analysis provides mechanistic insights into the interplay of the RQC factors Vms1, Rqc2 and Arb1 and their role in the protection of mitochondria from the aggregation of toxic proteins. Structural Basis for Bacterial Ribosome-Associated Quality Control by RqcH and RqcP. In all branches of life, stalled translation intermediates are recognized and processed by ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathways. RQC begins with the splitting of stalled ribosomes, leaving an unfinished polypeptide still attached to the large subunit. Ancient\nprotein folding, which prevents the accumulation of abnormal and non-functional proteins. Translation elongation is the fundamental step in gene expression to ensure cellular functions, and abnormal translation arrest is recognized and removed by the quality controls. Recent studies demonstrated that ribosome plays crucial roles as a hub for gene regulation and quality controls. Ribosome-interacting factors are critical for the quality control mechanisms responding to abnormal translation arrest by targeting its products for degradation. Aberrant mRNAs are produced by errors in mRNA maturation steps and cause aberrant translation and are eliminated by the quality control system. In this review, we focus on recent progress on two quality controls, Ribosome-associated Quality Control (RQC) and No-Go Decay (NGD), for abnormal translational elongation. These quality controls recognize aberrant ribosome stalling and induce rapid degradation of aberrant polypeptides and mRNAs thereby maintaining protein homeostasis and preventing the protein aggregation.\ndoes not result in subsequent substrate degradation. We demonstrate that Ltn1 catalyzes the regulatory ubiquitylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 and 2 (RPS6KA1, RPS6KA3). Further, loss of Ltn1 function results in hyperactivation of RSK1/2 signaling without impacting RSK1/2 protein turnover. These results suggest that Ltn1-mediated RSK1/2 ubiquitylation is inhibitory and establishes a new role for Ltn1 in regulating mitogen-activated kinase signaling via regulatory RSK1/2 ubiquitylation. Taken together, our results suggest that mammalian RQC interactions are difficult to observe and may be more transient than the homologous complex in S. cerevisiae and that Ltn1 has RQC-independent functions. The ribosome-bound quality control complex remains associated to aberrant peptides during their proteasomal targeting and interacts with Tom1 to limit protein aggregation. Protein quality control mechanisms eliminate defective polypeptides to ensure proteostasis and to avoid the toxicity of protein aggregates.

Thus, potentiation of TRPV1 responses by cAMP-dependent PKA involves plasma membrane insertion of functional TRPV1 multimers formed from an intracellular store of inactive TRPV1 monomers. This potentiation occurs rapidly and can be dynamically modulated by activation of the mu opioid receptor under conditions where cAMP levels are raised, such as with inflammation. Increased translocation and multimerization of TRPV1 channels provide a cellular mechanism for fine-tuning of nociceptive responses that allow for rapid modulation of TRPV1 responses independent of transcriptional changes. Intact microtubules preserve transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) functionality through receptor binding. The transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) is a protein currently under scrutiny as a pharmacological target for pain management therapies. Recently, the role of\nin the development of neuropathic pain and hyperalgesia. In humans, disease-related changes in TRPV1 expression have already been described (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome). The mechanisms that regulate TRPV1 gene expression under pathological conditions are unknown but a better understanding of these pathways has obvious implications for rational drug development. Understanding TRPV1 activation by ligands: Insights from the binding modes of capsaicin and resiniferatoxin. The transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) or vanilloid receptor 1 is a nonselective cation channel that is involved in the detection and transduction of nociceptive stimuli. Inflammation and nerve damage result in the up-regulation of TRPV1 transcription, and, therefore, modulators of TRPV1 channels are potentially useful in the treatment of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Understanding the binding modes of known ligands would significantly contribute to the success of TRPV1 modulator drug design programs. The recent cryo-electron microscopy structure\nBiochemical pharmacology of the vanilloid receptor TRPV1. An update. There is mounting evidence that the vanilloid (capsaicin) receptor; transient receptor potential channel, vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1), is subjected to multiple interacting levels of control. The first level is by reversible phosphorylation catalyzed by intrinsic kinases (e.g. protein kinase A and C) and phosphatases (e.g. calcineurin), which plays a pivotal role in receptor sensitization vs. tachyphylaxis. In addition, this mechanism links TRPV1 to intracellular signaling by various important endogenous as well as exogenous substances such as bradykinin, ethanol, nicotin and insulin. It is not clear, however, whether phosphorylation per se is sufficient to liberate TRPV1 under the inhibitory control of phosphatydylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate. The second level of control is by forming TRPV1 heteromers and their association with putative regulatory proteins. The next level of regulation is by subcellular compartmentalization. The membrane form of TRPV1 functions as a nonselective cation channel. On the\nmechanisms. Antinociceptive Activity of Vanilloids in Caenorhabditis elegans is Mediated by the Desensitization of the TRPV Channel OCR-2 and Specific Signal Transduction Pathways. Vanilloids, including capsaicin and eugenol, are ligands of transient receptor potential channel vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1). Prolonged treatment with vanilloids triggered the desensitization of TRPV1, leading to analgesic or antinociceptive effects. Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is a model organism expressing vanilloid receptor orthologs (e.g., OSM-9 and OCR-2) that are associated with behavioral and physiological processes, including sensory transduction. We have shown that capsaicin and eugenol hamper the nocifensive response to noxious heat in C. elegans. The objective of this study was to perform proteomics to identify proteins and pathways responsible for the induced phenotype and to identify capsaicin and eugenol targets using a thermal proteome profiling (TPP) strategy. The results indicated hierarchical differences following Reactome Pathway enrichment analyses between capsaicin- and eugenol-treated nematodes. However, both treated\nas expected for a homotetramer. In contrast, pairs of antibodies decorated tags on TRPV1::TRPA1 predominantly at 180\u00b0, indicating the formation of a channel consisting of two TRPV1::TRPA1 concatemers arranged face to face. TRPV1::TRPA1 was sensitized by PKC activation and could be inhibited by a TRPV1 antagonist. TRPV1::TRPA1 was activated by heat and displayed a threshold and temperature coefficient similar to TRPV1. However, the channel formed by TRPV1::TRPA1 has only two binding sites for capsaicin and shows less total current and a smaller capsaicin-induced shift in voltage-dependent gating than TRPV1::TRPV1 or TRPV1. We conclude that the presence of TRPA1 exerts a functional inhibition on TRPV1. Distinct properties of Ca2+-calmodulin binding to N- and C-terminal regulatory regions of the TRPV1 channel. Transient receptor potential (TRP) vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a molecular pain receptor belonging to the TRP superfamily of nonselective cation channels. As a polymodal receptor, TRPV1 responds to heat and a\nof known ligands would significantly contribute to the success of TRPV1 modulator drug design programs. The recent cryo-electron microscopy structure of TRPV1 only provides a coarse characterization of the location of capsaicin (CAPS) and resiniferatoxin (RTX). Herein, we use the information contained in the experimental electron density maps to accurately determine the binding mode of CAPS and RTX and experimentally validate the computational results by mutagenesis. On the basis of these results, we perform a detailed analysis of TRPV1-ligand interactions, characterizing the protein ligand contacts and the role of individual water molecules. Importantly, our results provide a rational explanation and suggestion of TRPV1 ligand modifications that should improve binding affinity. Direct evidence for functional TRPV1/TRPA1 heteromers. Transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1) plays a key role in sensing environmental hazards and in enhanced pain sensation following inflammation. A considerable proportion of TRPV1-expressing cells also express transient\nunderlying the gating and regulation of TRP channels remain largely unclear. Recent advances in cryogenic electron microscopy provided structural insights into 19 different TRP channels which all revealed close proximity of the C-terminus with the N-terminus and intracellular S4-S5 linker. Further studies found that some highly conserved residues in these regions of TRPV, -P, -C and -M members mediate functionally critical intramolecular interactions (i.e., within one subunit) between these regions. This review provides an overview on (1) intramolecular interactions in TRP channels and their effect on channel function; (2) functional roles of interplays between PIP2 (and other ligands) and TRP intramolecular interactions; and (3) relevance of the ligand-induced modulation of intramolecular interaction to diseases. Rapid, opioid-sensitive mechanisms involved in transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 sensitization. TRPV1 is a nociceptive, Ca2+-selective ion channel involved in the development of several painful conditions. Sensitization of TRPV1 responses by cAMP-dependent PKA crucially contributes to\nin sensing environmental hazards and in enhanced pain sensation following inflammation. A considerable proportion of TRPV1-expressing cells also express transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily A, member 1 (TRPA1). There is evidence for a TRPV1-TRPA1 interaction that is predominantly calcium-dependent, and it has been suggested that the two proteins might form a heteromeric channel. Here, we constructed subunit concatemers to search for direct evidence for such an interaction. We found that a TRPV1::TRPV1 concatemer and TRPV1 formed channels with similar properties. A TRPV1::TRPA1 concatemer was responsive to TRPV1 agonists capsaicin, acidic pH and ethanol, but not to TRPA1 agonists. Isolated TRPV1 and TRPV1::TRPA1 imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM) both had molecular volumes consistent with the formation of tetrameric channels. Antibodies decorated epitope tags on TRPV1 with a four-fold symmetry, as expected for a homotetramer. In contrast, pairs of antibodies decorated tags on TRPV1::TRPA1 predominantly at 180\u00b0, indicating the formation\n(TPP) strategy. The results indicated hierarchical differences following Reactome Pathway enrichment analyses between capsaicin- and eugenol-treated nematodes. However, both treated groups were associated mainly with signal transduction pathways, energy generation, biosynthesis and structural processes. Wnt signaling, a specific signal transduction pathway, is involved following treatment with both molecules. Wnt signaling pathway is noticeably associated with pain. The TPP results show that capsaicin and eugenol target OCR-2 but not OSM-9. Further protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses showed other targets associated with enzymatic catalysis and calcium ion binding activity. The resulting data help to better understand the broad-spectrum pharmacological activity of vanilloids. Vitamin D is an endogenous partial agonist of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 channel. KEY POINTS: 25-Hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) is a partial agonist of TRPV1 whereby 25OHD can weakly activate TRPV1 yet antagonize the stimulatory effects of the full TRPV1 agonists capsaicin and oleoyl dopamine. 25OHD binds to TRPV1 within\nin sensory neurons of wild type and TRPV1 knock-out mice demonstrated that co-expression of TRPV1 with TRPA1 results in outward rectification of single channel mustard oil (I(MO)) current-voltage relationships (I-V) and substantial modulation of the open probability at negative holding potentials. TRPV1 also does not influence the characteristics of single channel I(MO) in Ca(2+)-free extracellular solution. However, association of TRPA1 with TRPV1 was not affected in Ca(2+)-free media. To assess a role of intracellular Ca(2+) in TRPV1-dependent modulation of TRPA1 modulation, the TRPA1-mediated single channel WIN55,212-2-gated current (I(WIN)) was recorded in inside-out configuration. Our data indicate that single channel properties of TRPA1 are regulated by TRPV1 independently of intracellular Ca(2+). In summary, our results support the hypothesis that TRPV1 and TRPA1 form a complex and that TRPV1 influences intrinsic characteristics of the TRPA1 channel. Roles of Intramolecular Interactions in the Regulation of TRP Channels. The transient receptor potential (TRP) channels,\nreceptor belonging to the TRP superfamily of nonselective cation channels. As a polymodal receptor, TRPV1 responds to heat and a wide range of chemical stimuli. The influx of calcium after channel activation serves as a negative feedback mechanism leading to TRPV1 desensitization. The cellular calcium sensor calmodulin (CaM) likely participates in the desensitization of TRPV1. Two CaM-binding sites are identified in TRPV1: the N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) and a short distal C-terminal (CT) segment. Here, we present the crystal structure of calcium-bound CaM (Ca(2+)-CaM) in complex with the TRPV1-CT segment, determined to 1.95-\u00c5 resolution. The two lobes of Ca(2+)-CaM wrap around a helical TRPV1-CT segment in an antiparallel orientation, and two hydrophobic anchors, W787 and L796, contact the C-lobe and N-lobe of Ca(2+)-CaM, respectively. This structure is similar to canonical Ca(2+)-CaM-peptide complexes, although TRPV1 contains no classical CaM recognition sequence motif. Using structural and mutational studies, we established the\nof the TRPA1 channel. Roles of Intramolecular Interactions in the Regulation of TRP Channels. The transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, classified into six (-A, -V, -P, -C, -M, -ML, -N and -Y) subfamilies, are important membrane sensors and mediators of diverse stimuli including pH, light, mechano-force, temperature, pain, taste, and smell. The mammalian TRP superfamily of 28 members share similar membrane topology with six membrane-spanning helices (S1-S6) and cytosolic N-/C-terminus. Abnormal function or expression of TRP channels is associated with cancer, skeletal dysplasia, immunodeficiency, and cardiac, renal, and neuronal diseases. The majority of TRP members share common functional regulators such as phospholipid PIP2, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), and cannabinoid, while other ligands are more specific, such as allyl isothiocyanate (TRPA1), vanilloids (TRPV1), menthol (TRPM8), ADP-ribose (TRPM2), and ML-SA1 (TRPML1). The mechanisms underlying the gating and regulation of TRP channels remain largely unclear. Recent advances in cryogenic electron microscopy provided structural insights\nTRPV1 yet antagonize the stimulatory effects of the full TRPV1 agonists capsaicin and oleoyl dopamine. 25OHD binds to TRPV1 within the same vanilloid binding pocket as capsaicin. 25OHD inhibits the potentiating effects of PKC-mediated TRPV1 activity. 25OHD reduces T-cell activation and trigeminal neuron calcium signalling mediated by TRPV1 activity. These results provide evidence that TRPV1 is a novel receptor for the biological actions of vitamin D in addition to the well-documented effects of vitamin D upon the nuclear vitamin D receptor. The results may have important implications for our current understanding of certain diseases where TRPV1 and vitamin D deficiency have been implicated, such as chronic pain and autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes.ABSTRACT: The capsaicin receptor TRPV1 plays an important role in nociception, inflammation and immunity and its activity is regulated by exogenous and endogenous lipophilic ligands. As vitamin D is lipophilic and involved in similar biological processes\ndynamically to intact microtubules but not to tubulin dimers. Upon microtubule disassembly, the interaction with TRPV1 is lost thereby inducing receptor self-aggregation with partial loss of functionality. Intact microtubules play an essential role in maintaining TRPV1 functionality toward activation stimuli. This previously undisclosed property mirrors the recently reported role of TRPV1 in modulating microtubule assembly/disassembly and suggests the participation of these two players in a feedback cycle linking nociception and cytoskeletal remodeling. Association of TRPV1 and TLR4 through the TIR domain potentiates TRPV1 activity by blocking activation-induced desensitization. BACKGROUND: We have previously reported that histamine-induced pruritus was attenuated in toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) knockout mice due to decreased transient receptor potential V1 (TRPV1) sensitivity. Our results implied that TLR4 potentiated TRPV1 activation in sensory neurons; however, the molecular mechanism has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of TLR4-mediated TRPV1 potentiation using TLR4-deficient sensory neurons\nactivity is regulated by exogenous and endogenous lipophilic ligands. As vitamin D is lipophilic and involved in similar biological processes as TRPV1, we hypothesized that it directly regulates TRPV1 activity and function. Our calcium imaging and electrophysiological data demonstrate that vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D (1,25OHD)) can weakly activate TRPV1 at physiologically relevant concentrations (100 nM). Furthermore, both 25OHD and 1,25OHD can inhibit capsaicin-induced TRPV1 activity (IC50 = 34.3 \u00b1 0.2 and 11.5 \u00b1 0.9 nM, respectively), but not pH-induced TRPV1 activity, suggesting that vitamin D interacts with TRPV1 in the same region as the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin. This hypothesis is supported by our in silico TRPV1 structural modelling studies, which place 25OHD in the same binding region as capsaicin. 25OHD also attenuates PKC-dependent TRPV1 potentiation via interactions with a known PKC phospho-acceptor residue in TRPV1. To provide evidence for a physiological role for the interaction of\nyet to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of TLR4-mediated TRPV1 potentiation using TLR4-deficient sensory neurons and a heterologous expression system.METHODS: Primary sensory neurons were obtained from wild-type or TLR4 knockout mice, and HEK293T cells expressing TRPV1 and TLR4 were prepared by transient transfection. TRPV1 activity was analyzed by calcium imaging, fluorophotometry, and patch-clamp recording. Subcellular protein distribution was tested by immunocytochemistry and cell surface biotinylation assay. Protein interaction was assessed by western blot and immunoprecipitation assay.RESULTS: Direct association between TRPV1 and TLR4 was detected in HEK293T cells upon heterologous TRPV1 and TLR4 expression. In an immunoprecipitation assay using TLR4-deletion mutants and soluble toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) protein, the cytoplasmic TIR domain of TLR4 was required for TLR4-TRPV1 association and TRPV1 potentiation. In TLR4-deficient sensory neurons, the activation-induced desensitization of TRPV1 increased, accompanied by enhanced TRPV1 clearance from the cell membrane upon activation compared to wild-type neurons.\ninteractions with a known PKC phospho-acceptor residue in TRPV1. To provide evidence for a physiological role for the interaction of vitamin D with TRPV1, we employed two different cellular models known to express TRPV1: mouse CD4+ T-cells and trigeminal neurons. Our results indicate that 25OHD reduces TRPV1-induced cytokine release from T-cells and capsaicin-induced calcium activity in trigeminal neurons. In summary, we provide evidence that vitamin D is a novel endogenous regulator of TRPV1 channel activity that may play an important physiological role in addition to its known effects through the canonical nuclear vitamin D receptor pathway. Contribution of TRPV1-TRPA1 interaction to the single channel properties of the TRPA1 channel. Several lines of evidence suggest that TRPA1 and TRPV1 mutually control the transduction of inflammation-induced noxious stimuli in sensory neurons. It was recently shown that certain TRPA1 properties are modulated by TRPV1. However, direct interaction between TRPA1 and TRPV1 as well\nion channel involved in the development of several painful conditions. Sensitization of TRPV1 responses by cAMP-dependent PKA crucially contributes to the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia. However, the pathways involved in potentiation of TRPV1 responses by cAMP-dependent PKA remain largely unknown. Using HEK cells stably expressing TRPV1 and the mu opioid receptor, we demonstrated that treatment with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin significantly increased the multimeric TRPV1 species. Pretreatment with the mu opioid receptor agonist morphine reversed this increased TRPV1 multimerization. FRET analysis revealed that treatment with forskolin did not cause multimerization of pre-existing TRPV1 monomers on the plasma membrane and that intracellular pools of TRPV1 exist mostly as monomers in this model. This suggests that increased TRPV1 multimerization occurred from an intracellular store of inactive TRPV1 monomers. Treatment with forskolin also caused an increase in TRPV1 expression on the plasma membrane not resulting from increased TRPV1 expression, and this rapid\nlevel of regulation is by subcellular compartmentalization. The membrane form of TRPV1 functions as a nonselective cation channel. On the endoplasmic reticulum, TRPV1 is present in two differentially regulated forms, one of which is inositol triphosphate-dependent whereas the other is not. These three TRPV1 compartments provide a versatile regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) levels. Last, there is a complex and poorly understood regulation of TRPV1 activity via control of gene expression. Factors that downregulate TRPV1 expression include vanilloid treatment and growth factor (notably, nerve growth factor) deprivation. By contrast, TRPV1 appears to be upregulated during inflammatory conditions. Interestingly, following experimental nerve injury and in animal models of diabetic neuropathy TRPV1 is present on neurons that do not normally express TRPV1. Combined, these findings imply an important role for aberrant TRPV1 expression in the development of neuropathic pain and hyperalgesia. In humans, disease-related changes in TRPV1 expression have already been described (e.g.\nwas recently shown that certain TRPA1 properties are modulated by TRPV1. However, direct interaction between TRPA1 and TRPV1 as well as regulation of TRPA1 intrinsic characteristics by the TRPV1 channel have not been examined. To address these questions, we have studied a complex formation between TRPA1 and TRPV1 and characterized the influence of TRPV1 on single channel TRPA1-mediated currents. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed direct interactions between TRPA1 and TRPV1 in an expression system as well as in sensory neurons. Data generated with total internal reflection fluorescence-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer indicate that a TRPA1-TRPV1 complex can be formed on the plasma membrane. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer interaction between TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels is as effective as for TRPV1 or TRPA1 homomers. Single channel analysis in a heterologous expression system and in sensory neurons of wild type and TRPV1 knock-out mice demonstrated that co-expression of TRPV1 with TRPA1 results in outward",

        "desc": "the serotonin receptor type 3A intracellular domain. Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGIC) are expressed in both excitable and non-excitable cells that are targeted by numerous clinically used drugs. Assembly from five identical or homologous subunits yields homo- or heteromeric pentamers, respectively. The protein known as Resistance to Inhibitors of Cholinesterase (RIC-3) was identified to interfere with assembly and functional maturation of pLGICs. We have shown previously for serotonin type 3A homopentamers (5-HT3A ) that the interaction with RIC-3 requires the intracellular domain (ICD) of this pLGIC. After expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes RIC-3 attenuated serotonin-induced currents in 5-HT3A wild-type channels, but not in functional 5-HT3A glvM3M4 channels that have the 115-amino acid ICD replaced by a heptapeptide. In complementary experiments we have shown that engineering the Gloeobacter violaceus ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC) to contain the 5-HT3A -ICD confers sensitivity to RIC-3 in oocytes to otherwise insensitive GLIC. In this study,\nchimera interacts with RIC-3. We hypothesized that pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) associate directly with the chaperone protein RIC-3 (resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase type 3), and that the interaction does not require other protein factors. We found that the two proteins indeed interact directly, that the pLGIC intracellular domain is required for the effect, and that pLGICs in their pentameric form associate with RIC-3. These results provide the basis for future studies aimed at investigating which motifs provide the interaction surfaces, and at delineating the mechanism(s) of RIC-3 modulation of functional pLGIC surface expression. Coordinated regulation of cardiac Na(+)/Ca (2+) exchanger and Na (+)-K (+)-ATPase by phospholemman (FXYD1). Phospholemman (PLM) is the founding member of the FXYD family of regulators of ion transport.

Potassium ion (K+) uptake in yeast is mediated mainly by the Trk1/2 proteins that enable cells to survive on external K+ concentration as low as a few \u03bcM. Fungal Trks are related to prokaryotic TRK and Ktr and plant HKT K+ transport systems. Overall sequence similarity is very low, thus requiring experimental verification of homology models.

Loss of function mutations in mucolipin-1 (MCOLN1) have been linked to mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV), a recessive lysosomal storage disease characterized by severe neurological and ophthalmological abnormalities. MCOLN1 is an ion channel that regulates membrane transport along the endolysosomal pathway. It has been suggested that MCOLN1 participates in several Ca(2+)-dependent processes, including fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane, fusion of late endosomes and autophagosomes with lysosomes, and lysosomal biogenesis. Here, we searched for proteins that interact with MCOLN1 in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. We found that the penta-EF-hand protein ALG-2 binds to the NH-terminal cytosolic tail of MCOLN1. The interaction is direct, strictly dependent on Ca(2+), and mediated by a patch of charged and hydrophobic residues located between MCOLN1 residues 37 and 49. We further show that MCOLN1 and ALG-2 co-localize to enlarged endosomes induced by overexpression of\n\u03b3b forms of the Na,K-ATPase \u03b3 subunit Distinct regulatory effects of the Na,K-ATPase \u03b3 subunit Crystal structure of the sodium-potassium pump at 2.4 \u00c5 resolution Characterizing proteins and their interactions in cells and tissues using the in situ proximity ligation assay The FXYD gene family of small ion transport regulators or channels: cDNA sequence, protein signature sequence, and expression Mechanisms of sodium pump regulation Identification of FXYD protein genes in a teleost: tissue-specific expression and response to salinity change Spliced isoforms of LIM-domain-binding protein (CLIM/NLI/Ldb) lacking the LIM-interaction domain Effects of stanniocalcin 1 on calcium uptake in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo Branchial FXYD protein expression in response to salinity change and its interaction with Na+/K+-ATPase of the euryhaline teleost Tetraodon nigroviridis Role of SLC12A10.2, a Na-Cl cotransporter-like protein, in a Cl uptake mechanism in zebrafish (Danio rerio) A 29-kilodalton Golgi soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (Vti1-rp2) implicated in protein\nchannel (GLIC) to contain the 5-HT3A -ICD confers sensitivity to RIC-3 in oocytes to otherwise insensitive GLIC. In this study, we identify endogenous RIC-3 protein expression in X. laevis oocytes. We purified RIC-3 to homogeneity after expression in Echericia coli. By using heterologously over-expressed and purified RIC-3 and the chimera consisting of the 5-HT3A -ICD and the extracellular and transmembrane domains of GLIC in pull-down experiments, we demonstrate a direct and specific interaction between the two proteins. This result further underlines that the domain within 5-HT3 A R that mediates the interaction with RIC-3 is the ICD. Importantly, this is the first experimental evidence that the interaction between 5-HT3 A R-ICD and RIC-3 does not require other proteins. In addition, we demonstrate that the pentameric assembly of the GLIC-5-HT3A -ICD chimera interacts with RIC-3. We hypothesized that pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) associate directly with the chaperone protein RIC-3 (resistance\nis under hormonal control (Therien and Blostein,; Feraille and Doucet,). The \u03b2 subunit has important roles in maturation, stability, and trafficking of Na+\u2013K+-ATPase to the plasma membrane, as well as in K+ binding (Geering,; Shinoda et al.,). As an additional regulatory subunit, the FXYD-domain containing ion transport regulator (FXYD) family of small single-transmembrane proteins has been identified (Sweadner and Rael,; Geering,). FXYD proteins are characterized by a conserved Phe-X-Tyr-Asp motif at the cytoplasmic sides flanking their transmembrane domains. The transmembrane domain and the FXYD motif have been shown to play a role in binding to the \u03b1- and \u03b2-subunits (B\u00e9guin et al.,; Shinoda et al.,). FXYD proteins modulate Na+\u2013K+-ATPase activity by affecting the apparent affinities for intracellular Na+ and extracellular K+ ions (B\u00e9guin et al.,; Arystarkhova et al.,; Pu et al.,; Crambert et al.,; Garty et al.,; Geering,; Delprat et al.,). In mammals, seven FXYD members (FXYD1\u20137) have been identified\ncaused a 20-fold drop in binding affinity relative to the native sequence (Fig. 7B,C). These FIF-AAA mutations were then engineered into the full-length NaV1.5 and the corresponding decrease in channel function confirmed the functional significance of the interactions. In order to elucidate the detailed mechanism of the EF-hand domain, its structure was determined by NMR (Fig. 8) and combined with NMR chemical shift perturbations induced by binding of an IQ peptide, to construct a model of the complex. The model shows the IQ motif binds between Helices I and IV (Fig. 8) and predicts residues F1855 and L1786 are crucial for the interaction. Functional analysis on channels with the corresponding F1855A and L1786A mutations showed that the interaction between the IQ motif and EF-hand domain is required for proper Ca2+ sensing. The clinical implications of calcium-dependent regulation of NaV1.5 are highlighted by findings that mutations within CTD-EF, the IQ motif\nal. have reported that each type of MRC expresses different Na+\u2013K+-ATPase \u03b1 isozymes in the zebrafish gill, mRNA expression levels of which are affected by environmental Na+, Cl\u2212, and Ca2+ concentrations. Thus, it is conceivable that FXYD proteins may be expressed as a Na+\u2013K+-ATPase regulator in the MRCs of FW fish. To address this issue, in this study, we sought to identify a FXYD protein(s) that is expressed in zebrafish MRCs. We demonstrated that zebrafish Fxyd11 (zFxyd11) is highly expressed in NaK-MRCs of the larval skin and gills, the expression levels of which are induced in low salinity environment. We further showed that zFxyd11 was associated with Na+\u2013K+-ATPase in NaK-MRCs, and its knockdown affected the number of Na+\u2013K+-ATPase\u2013positive cells of the larval skin. These results suggest that zFxyd11 is likely the regulator of Na+\u2013K+-ATPase and involved in transepithelial ion transport across NaK-MRCs.

We further show that MCOLN1 and ALG-2 co-localize to enlarged endosomes induced by overexpression of an ATPase-defective dominant-negative form of Vps4B (Vps4B(E235Q)). In agreement with the proposed role of MCOLN1 in the regulation of fusion/fission events, we found that overexpression of MCOLN1 caused accumulation of enlarged, aberrant endosomes that contain both early and late endosome markers. Interestingly, aggregation of abnormal endosomes was greatly reduced when the ALG-2-binding domain in MCOLN1 was mutated, suggesting that ALG-2 regulates MCOLN1 function. Overall, our data provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms that regulate MCOLN1 activity. We propose that ALG-2 acts as a Ca(2+) sensor that modulates the function of MCOLN1 along the late endosomal-lysosomal pathway.

The high expression of MLC1 in brain astrocytes contacting blood vessels and meninges and brain alterations observed in MLC patients have led to hypothesize a role for MLC1 in the regulation of ion and water homeostasis. Recent studies have shown that MLC1 establishes structural and/or functional interactions with several ion/water channels and transporters and ion channel accessory proteins, and that these interactions are affected by MLC1 mutations causing MLC. Here, we review data on MLC1 functional properties obtained in in vitro and in vivo models and discuss evidence linking the effects of MLC1 mutations to brain channelopathies. FXYD5 Protein Has a Pro-inflammatory Role in Epithelial Cells. The FXYD proteins are a family of small membrane proteins that share an invariant four amino acid signature motif F-X-Y-D and\nis required. Our group demonstrated that NaV1.5 has a second means by which it responds to [Ca2+]i, one which involves direct binding of Ca2+ ions to an EF-hand domain that is just upstream from the IQ motif. Remarkably, we observed high affinity binding of Ca2+ to the EF-hand domain only in a construct containing the IQ motif. In addition, we showed the affinity and mode of interaction of CaM with the IQ motif was altered by the level of Ca2+. These studies suggested that the modulation of channel function by CaM and the EF-hand domain is coupled through the IQ motif, which led us to a proposal that the IQ motif serves as a molecular switch. Although knowledge of the molecular basis for sensing Ca2+ was valuable, there remained a critical gap to understanding how this altered channel function. We speculated that either CaM or the EF-hand domain must interact\ntolerated to some extent. Intriguingly, a secondary interaction of D79 with R76 could enhance folding/stability of Trk1 and enable a fraction of Trk1[K1147A] to fold. The part of the ion permeation path containing the selectivity filter is shaped similar to that of ion channels. However below the selectivity filter it is obstructed or regulated by a proline containing loop. The presented model could provide the structural basis for addressing the long standing question if Trk1 is a passive or active ion-translocation system. Proteomics to identify proteins interacting with P2X2 ligand-gated cation channels. Ligand-gated ion channels underlie synaptic communication in the nervous system(1). In mammals there are three families of ligand-gated channels: the cys loop, the glutamate-gated and the P2X receptor channel family(2). In each case binding of transmitter leads to the opening of a pore through which ions flow down their electrochemical gradients. Many ligand-gated channels are also permeable to\nusing direct structure determination and site directed mutagenesis/protein engineering. Structure combined with biochemistry provided the foundation to identify the fundamental mechanism of cooperativity in the binding of Ca2+ ions, which provides the ability of EFCaBPs to detect the relatively small changes in concentration that constitute Ca2+ signals. Using calbindin D9k as a model system, we characterized the structure and fast time scale dynamics of each of the four ion binding states in a typical EF-hand domain and showed direct evidence that site-site communication lowers the free energy cost of reorganization for binding the second ion. Our work has also extended models of how EFCaBPs interact with their cellular targets. By determining the unique dimeric architecture of S100 proteins, we described the implications for how these proteins transduce signals and went on to characterize interactions with peptide fragments of important cellular targets. Studies of the CaM homolog centrin revealed novel characteristics\nis evident that active ion transport of MRCs as well as other ion-transporting epithelial cells is coupled to Na+\u2013K+-ATPase, the regulatory mechanism of Na+\u2013K+-ATPase activity in MRCs remains to be clarified. Since the first fish FXYD was identified from shark rectal glands (Mahmmoud et al.,), the presence of teleost FXYD has been detected in osmoregulatory organs such as gills, intestine, and kidney (Tipsmark,; Wang et al.,). A recent study has identified a euryhaline pufferfish FXYD protein (pFXYD) highly expressed in the gill MRCs, and has suggested its role in adaptation to environmental salinity changes (Wang et al.,). In the present study, we identified an additional FXYD that is likely to modulate Na+\u2013K+-ATPase activity in the gill and skin MRCs of the FW fish zebrafish. As reported by Tipsmark, there are at least eight fxyd genes in the zebrafish database.

Binding of Ca2+ and a peptide fragment of Kar1p to the C-terminal\nIn the gills and skin, mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs, also called ionocytes or chloride cells) are the major sites of ion uptake, where Na+\u2013K+-ATPase and numerous ion transporters are present (Marshall,; Hirose et al.,; Perry et al.,; Kirschner,; Evans et al.,; Hwang,). Na+\u2013K+-ATPase pumps Na+ ions out of MRCs across the basolateral membrane, maintaining a low intracellular Na+ concentration. The Na+ gradient across the apical membrane is proposed to provide the driving force for ion uptake. Although there is no doubt that Na+\u2013K+-ATPase activity is essential for hypoosmotic adaptation of FW and euryhaline teleosts, a clear understanding as to how the activity in MRCs is regulated remains to be achieved. Recently, Wang et al. have provided evidence for FXYD-mediated regulation of Na+\u2013K+-ATPase activity in MRCs of euryhaline teleost pufferfish, that is, (1) a pufferfish FXYD protein (pFXYD) is coincident and associated with Na+\u2013K+-ATPase in the gill MRCs, and (2) the mRNA",

This report shows that cyclosporin A (CsA) interferes with the hypoxic signaling cascade in C6 glioma cells. CsA inhibits hypoxia-dependent gene transcription in a reporter gene assay and prevents the hypoxic accumulation of HIF-1alpha. Addition of the 530-603 C-terminal oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain of HIF-1alpha to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) destabilized the protein in an oxygen-dependent manner. CsA prevented the hypoxic stabilization of an ODD.GFP fusion protein.

It uses the capacity of specific peptides to stimulate the degradation of [(14)C]2-oxoglutarate. CsA stimulated the enzymatic activity in the presence of a peptide that mimicked the 557-576 sequence of HIF-1alpha. The\nkinin/nitric oxide/cGMP system in the cardiovascular and renal systems, resulting in AT2-R-mediated cardioprotection, vasodilation and pressure natriuresis. These effects, transmitted by AT2-R, are mainly exerted by stimulation of protein tyrosine or serine/threonine phosphatases in a Gi-protein-dependent manner. The expression level of AT2-R is much higher in human hearts than in rodent hearts, and the AT2-R-mediated actions are likely enhanced, especially by clinical application of AT1-R antagonists. Thus, in this review, the regulation of AT2-R expression, its cellular localization, its pathological role in cardiovascular and kidney diseases, and pharmacotherapeutic effects of AT2-R stimulation are discussed. Pathophysiological role of angiotensin II type 2 receptor in cardiovascular and renal diseases. Since the discovery of nonpeptidic ligands, the receptors for angiotensin (Ang) II have been classified into 2 subtypes (Ang II type 1 receptor [AT1-R] and Ang II type 2 receptor [AT2-R]). AT1-R mediates most of the cardiovascular actions of Ang II. AT2-R is\n[(14)C]2-oxoglutarate. CsA stimulated the enzymatic activity in the presence of a peptide that mimicked the 557-576 sequence of HIF-1alpha. The enzyme promoted [(35)S]vHL binding to glutathione S-transferase (GST).ODD fusion protein. This association increased in the presence of CsA. CsA effects were not observed when the proline residue corresponding to Pro-564 in the HIF-1alpha sequence was replaced by a hydroxyproline or an alanine residue. Finally, CsA increased vHL-ODD interaction during hypoxia. We conclude that CsA destabilizes HIF-1alpha by promoting hydroxylation of Pro-564 in the ODD domain. Such a mechanism may prevent hypoxic adaptation during CsA-induced nephrotoxicity and contribute to the adverse effects of this drug. Dominant negative AT2 receptor oligomers induce G-protein arrest and symptoms of neurodegeneration. Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) correlates with dysfunction of signaling mediated by Galphaq/11. Nondissociable angiotensin II AT2 receptor oligomers are linked to the impaired Galphaq/11-stimulated signaling of AD patients and transgenic mice with AD-like\nof HIF are primarily regulated by the enzymatic hydroxylation that induces rapid proteasomal degradation. The HIFalpha hydroxylases belong to a superfamily of dioxygenases that require the co-substrates oxygen and 2-oxoglutarate as well as the cofactors Fe2+ and ascorbate. The regulation of enzyme turnover by the concentration of the cosubstrate oxygen constitutes the interface between tissue oxygen level and the activity of HIF. The HIFalpha prolyl hydroxylases, termed PHDs/EGLNs (prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins/EGL nine homologues), bind to a conserved Leu-Xaa-Xaa-Leu-Ala-Pro motif present in all substrates identified so far. This recognition motif is present twice in HIF1alpha, which gives rise to a NODD [N-terminal ODD (oxygen-dependent degradation domain)] containing Pro402 of HIF1alpha and a CODD (C-terminal ODD) where Pro564 is hydroxylated. PHD1/EGLN2 and PHD2/EGLN1 hydroxylate both ODDs with higher activity towards CODD, whereas PHD3/EGLN3 is specific for CODD. The reason for this behaviour has been unclear. In this issue of the Biochemical\nangiotensin II AT2 receptor oligomers are linked to the impaired Galphaq/11-stimulated signaling of AD patients and transgenic mice with AD-like symptoms. To further analyze the role of AT2 receptor oligomers, we induced the formation of AT2 oligomers in an in vitro cell system. Similarly as in vivo, sequential oxidative and transglutaminase-dependent cross-linking steps triggered the formation of AT2 oligomers in vitro. Elevated reactive oxygen species mediated oxidative cross-linking of AT2 monomers to dimers involving tyrosine residues located at putative interreceptor contact sites of the cytoplasmic loop connecting transmembrane helices III/IV. Cross-linked AT2 dimers were subsequently a substrate of activated transglutaminase-2, which targeted the carboxyl terminus of AT2 dimers, as assessed by truncated and chimeric AT2 receptors, respectively. AT2 oligomers acted as dominant negative receptors in vitro by mediating Galphaq/11 protein sequestration and Galphaq/11 protein arrest. The formation of AT2 oligomers and G-protein dysfunction could be suppressed in vitro and in\nThe angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor: an enigmatic seven transmembrane receptor. Angiotensin II (AngII) interacts with two receptor subtypes, AT1 and AT2, belonging to the seven transmembrane receptor superfamily. Pharmacological investigations initially suggested that AT2 receptors antagonize AT1 effects. Data from AT2 receptor transgenic and knock-out mice have not been entirely consistent with this interpretation. At the cellular level, a clear mechanistic model of AT2 transduction and signalling has yet to emerge. The AT2 receptor displays the hallmark motifs and signature residues of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), but fails to demonstrate most of the classic features of GPCR signalling. In recent years, unbiased screens for AT2-interacting proteins have identified novel partner proteins involved in AT2 signalling, providing new insight into the mechanisms of AT2 action. A growing body of evidence suggests that the AT2 receptor is constitutively active (i.e. signals without AngII). This review critically evaluates controversies surrounding\n[AT1-R] and Ang II type 2 receptor [AT2-R]). AT1-R mediates most of the cardiovascular actions of Ang II. AT2-R is expressed at very high levels in the developing fetus. Its expression is very low in the cardiovascular system of the adult. The expression of AT2-R can be modulated by pathological states associated with tissue remodeling or inflammation. In failing hearts or neointima formation after vascular injury, AT2-R is reexpressed in cells proliferating in interstitial regions or neointima and exerts an inhibitory effect on Ang II-induced mitogen signals or synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins, resulting in attenuation of the tissue remodeling. An extreme form of cell growth inhibition ends in programmed cell death, and this process, which is initiated by the withdrawal of growth factors, is also enhanced by AT2-R. Cardiac myocyte- or vascular smooth muscle-specific mice that overexpress AT2-R display an inhibition of Ang II-induced chronotropic or pressor actions, suggesting\nsequestration and Galphaq/11 protein arrest. The formation of AT2 oligomers and G-protein dysfunction could be suppressed in vitro and in vivo by an AT2 receptor mutant. Inhibition of AT2 oligomerization upon stereotactic expression of the AT2 receptor mutant revealed that Galphaq/11-sequestering AT2 oligomers enhanced the development of neurodegenerative symptoms in the hippocampus of transgenic mice with AD-like pathology. Thus, AT2 oligomers inducing Galphaq/11 arrest are causally involved in inducing symptoms of neurodegeneration. Roles of the intracellular regions of angiotensin II receptor AT2 in mediating reduction of intracellular cGMP levels. We have shown previously that the angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor AT2 reduces the intracellular levels of cGMP in Xenopus oocytes when activated by ligand binding, and the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the AT2 acts as a negative regulator of this function. Here we report the effects of mutations in the 2nd and 3rd intracellular loops of AT2 on AT2-mediated cGMP\nwhereas PHD3/EGLN3 is specific for CODD. The reason for this behaviour has been unclear. In this issue of the Biochemical Journal, Villar and colleagues demonstrate that distinct PHD/EGLN domains, that are remote from the catalytic site, function in substrate discrimination. This elegant study improves our understanding of the interaction of the oxygen-sensing PHDs/EGLNs with their substrates, which include, but are not limited to, the HIFalpha proteins. [Angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor signal and cardiovascular action]. Due to the discovery of nonpeptic ligands, the receptors for angiotensin (Ang) II are classified into two subtypes (AT1-R and AT2-R). AT1-R mediates most of the cardiovascular actions of Ang II. AT2-R is expressed at very high levels in the developing fetus. Its expression is very low in the cardiovascular system of the adult. The expression of AT2-R can be modulated by pathological states associated with tissue remodeling or inflammation. In failing hearts or\nthe region spanning the third ICL and carboxy terminus of the AT2 receptor. Since the third ICL of the AT2 receptor is essential for exerting its inhibitory effects on cell growth, possible involvement of this region in the interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of the ErbB3 receptor suggests a novel signaling mechanism for the AT2 receptor mediated inhibition of cell growth. Furthermore, since both the AT2 and the ErbB3 receptors are expressed during fetal development, we propose that the existence of direct interaction between these two receptors may play a role in the regulation of growth during the initial stages of development. Cyclosporin A prevents the hypoxic adaptation by activating hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha Pro-564 hydroxylation. The mechanism by which hypoxia induces gene transcription involves the inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha prolyl hydroxylase activity, which prevents von Hippel-Lindau (vHL)-dependent targeting of HIF-1alpha to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. HIF-1alpha is stabilized, translocates to the\nmyocyte- or vascular smooth muscle-specific mice that overexpress AT2-R display an inhibition of Ang II-induced chronotropic or pressor actions, suggesting the role of AT2-R on the activity of cardiac pacemaker cells and the maintenance of vascular resistance. AT2-R also activates the kinin/nitric oxide/cGMP system in the cardiovascular and renal systems, resulting in AT2-R-mediated cardioprotection, vasodilation, and pressure natriuresis. These effects, transmitted by AT2-R, are mainly exerted by stimulation of protein tyrosine or serine/threonine phosphatases in a Gi protein-dependent manner. The expression level of AT2-R is much higher in human hearts than in rodent hearts, and the AT2-R-mediated actions are likely enhanced, especially by clinical application of AT1-R antagonists. Thus, in this review, the regulation of AT2-R expression, its cellular localization, its pathological role in cardiovascular and kidney diseases, and pharmacotherapeutic effects of AT2-R stimulation are discussed.\nfor ATP binding of the ErbB3 and ErbB2 receptors, was identified to be interacting with the AT2 receptor. The interaction between the human ErbB3 receptor and the AT2 receptor was further confirmed using the cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 671-782) of the human ErbB3 receptor. Moreover, an AT2 receptor peptide that spans the amino acids 226-363, (spans the third ICL and carboxy terminal domain) could also interact with the AT2 receptor in a yeast Two-Hybrid protein-protein interaction assay. Studies using mutated and chimeric AT2 receptors showed that replacing the third intracellular loop (ICL) of the AT2 receptor with that of the AT1 abolishes the interaction between the ErbB3 and the AT2 in yeast Two-Hybrid protein-protein interaction assay. Thus the interaction between the AT2 receptor and the ErbB3 receptor seems to require the region spanning the third ICL and carboxy terminus of the AT2 receptor. Since the third ICL of the AT2\nfunction. Here we report the effects of mutations in the 2nd and 3rd intracellular loops of AT2 on AT2-mediated cGMP reduction. Mutating the highly conserved DRY motif (D141G-R142G-Y143A) of the 2nd ICL implicated in activating G(alpha) subunit of trimeric G-proteins did not affect AT2-mediated cGMP reduction. Moreover, anti-Gialpha antibody or phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX did not inhibit AT2-mediated cGMP reduction, suggesting that Gialpha activation and subsequent phosphodiesterase activation are not involved in this function. In contrast, mutations T250R-R251N and L255F-K256R located in the C-terminus of the 3rd ICL of AT2 retained ligand-binding properties of the wild-type AT2, and its ability to interact with the ErbB3 in yeast two-hybrid assay, but abolished AT2-mediated cGMP reduction. Similarities in the roles of ICLs of AT2 in AT2-mediated cGMP reduction in oocytes, and AT2-mediated SHP1 activation in COS-7 cells, (need of 3rd ICL for both functions and lack of involvement of DRY motif), suggest that\nThe expression of AT2-R can be modulated by pathological states associated with tissue remodeling or inflammation.

These effects, transmitted\nof evidence suggests that the AT2 receptor is constitutively active (i.e. signals without AngII). This review critically evaluates controversies surrounding physiological functions and signalling mechanisms of the AT2 receptor, primarily in a cardiovascular context. Recent advances in the field are highlighted and findings challenging the concept that the AT2 receptor is a conventional angiotensin receptor are considered. Identification of an interaction between the angiotensin II receptor sub-type AT2 and the ErbB3 receptor, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family. To identify the proteins that interact and mediate angiotensin II receptor AT2-specific signaling, a random peptide library was screened by yeast-based Two-Hybrid protein-protein interaction assay technique. A peptide that shared significant homology with the amino acids located between the residues Gly-Xaa-Gly-Xaa-Xaa-Gly721 and Lys742, the residues predicted to be important for ATP binding of the ErbB3 and ErbB2 receptors, was identified to be interacting with the AT2 receptor. The interaction\nactivation in COS-7 cells, (need of 3rd ICL for both functions and lack of involvement of DRY motif), suggest that the cascade of events in these two signaling mechanisms could be similar, and that an oocyte-specific SHP1-like protein may be involved in AT2-mediated cGMP reduction in these cells. Enzyme substrate recognition in oxygen sensing: how the HIF trap snaps. The transcriptional activator HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) is a focal point of biomedical research because many situations in physiology and in pathology coincide with hypoxia. The effects of HIF activation may be a facet of normal growth, as in embryonic development, they may counterbalance a disease, as seen in the stimulation of erythropoiesis in anaemia, and they may be part of the pathological processes, as exemplified by tumour angiogenesis. The oxygen-sensitive alpha-subunits of HIF are primarily regulated by the enzymatic hydroxylation that induces rapid proteasomal degradation. The HIFalpha hydroxylases belong to a",

Rather, homo-oligomeric Afg3l2 complexes accumulate, and these complexes can substitute for housekeeping functions of paraplegin-containing m-AAA complexes. We therefore propose that the formation of m-AAA proteases with altered substrate specificities leads to axonal degeneration in HSP. p53 is required for cisplatin-induced processing of the mitochondrial fusion protein L-Opa1 that is mediated by the mitochondrial metallopeptidase Oma1 in gynecologic cancers. Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles, and mitochondrial fission is a crucial step of apoptosis. Although Oma1 is believed to be responsible for long form Opa1 (L-Opa1) processing during mitochondrial fragmentation, whether and how Oma1 is involved in L-Opa1 processing and participates in the regulation of chemoresistance is unknown. Chemosensitive and chemoresistant ovarian (OVCA) and cervical (CECA) cancer cells were treated with cisplatin (CDDP). Mitochondrial dynamics and protein contents were\nby the m-AAA protease in mitochondria. Prohibitins comprise a protein family in eukaryotic cells with potential roles in senescence and tumor suppression. Phb1p and Phb2p, members of the prohibitin family in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have been implicated in the regulation of the replicative life span of the cells and in the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology. The functional activities of these proteins, however, have not been elucidated. We demonstrate here that prohibitins regulate the turnover of membrane proteins by the m-AAA protease, a conserved ATP-dependent protease in the inner membrane of mitochondria. The m-AAA protease is composed of the homologous subunits Yta10p (Afg3p) and Yta12p (Rca1p). Deletion of PHB1 or PHB2 impairs growth of Deltayta10 or Deltayta12 cells but does not affect cell growth in the presence of the m-AAA protease. A prohibitin complex with a native molecular mass of approximately 2 MDa containing Phb1p and Phb2p forms a supercomplex with the\na stress-dependent manner generating S-OPA1. Excessive S-OPA1 can facilitate outer membrane permeabilization upon BAX/BAK1 activation through its membrane shaping properties. p53 helps outer membrane permeabilization in a 2-step process. First, cytosolic p53 activates BAX/BAK1 at the mitochondrial surface. Then, in a second step, p53 binds to prohibitin thereby releasing the restraint on OMA1. This activates OMA1, which cleaves OPA1 and promotes cytochrome c release. Clearly, OMA1 and OPA1 are not root causes for cancer. Yet many cancer cells rely on this pathway for survival, which can explain why loss of p53 function promotes tumor growth and confers resistance to chemotherapies. Variable and tissue-specific subunit composition of mitochondrial m-AAA protease complexes linked to hereditary spastic paraplegia. The m-AAA protease, an ATP-dependent proteolytic complex in the mitochondrial inner membrane, controls protein quality and regulates ribosome assembly, thus exerting essential housekeeping functions within mitochondria. Mutations in the m-AAA protease subunit paraplegin cause axonal\nYME1L undergoes a reversible conformational change in response to oxidative stress that involves the interaction of one hydrogen peroxide molecule per YME1L monomer with affinities equal to 31 \u00b1 2 and 26 \u00b1 1 mM for conditions lacking or including nucleotide, respectively. Our data also reveal that oxidative stress does not significantly impact nucleotide binding equilibria, but does stimulate a 2-fold increase in the rate constant for high-affinity ATP binding from (8.9 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 105 M-1 s-1 to (1.5 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 106 M-1 s-1. Taken together, these data may suggest a mechanism for the regulated processing of YME1L by other inner membrane proteases such as OMA1. Sustained OMA1-mediated integrated stress response is beneficial for spastic ataxia type 5. AFG3L2 is a mitochondrial protease exerting protein quality control in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Heterozygous AFG3L2 mutations cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 28 (SCA28) or dominant optic atrophy type 12 (DOA12),\ndrugs. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Recently, the mitochondrial protease OMA1, which regulates internal and external signals in mitochondria by cleaving mitochondrial proteins, was shown to be related to tumor progression. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of OMA1 on the response to chemotherapeutics in ovarian cancer cells and the mouse subcutaneous tumor model. We found that OMA1 activation increased ovarian cancer sensitivity to cisplatin in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, in ovarian cancer, OMA1 cleaved optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), leading to mitochondrial inner membrane cristae remodeling. Simultaneously, OMA1 induced DELE1 cleavage and its cytoplasmic interaction with EIF2AK1. We also demonstrated that EIF2AK1 cooperated with the ER stress sensor EIF2AK3 to amplify the EIF2S1/ATF4 signal, resulting in the rupture of the mitochondrial outer membrane. Knockdown of OMA1 attenuated these activities and reversed apoptosis. Additionally, we found that OMA1 protease activity was regulated by the prohibitin 2 (PHB2)/stomatin-like protein 2 (STOML2)\nin the axonal transport of mitochondria. Moreover m-AAA proteases regulate the assembly of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex. Impaired degradation of the MCU subunit EMRE in AFG3L2-deficient mitochondria results in the formation of deregulated MCU complexes, increased mitochondrial calcium uptake and increased vulnerability of neurons for calcium-induced cell death. A reduction of calcium influx into the cytosol of Purkinje cells rescues ataxia in an AFG3L2-deficient mouse model. In this review, we discuss the relationship between the m-AAA protease and mitochondrial calcium homeostasis and its relevance for neurodegeneration and describe a novel mouse model lacking MCU specifically in Purkinje cells. Our results pledge for a novel view on m-AAA proteases that integrates their pleiotropic functions in mitochondria to explain the pathogenesis of associated neurodegenerative disorders. Prohibitins regulate membrane protein degradation by the m-AAA protease in mitochondria. Prohibitins comprise a protein family in eukaryotic cells with potential roles in senescence and\nof only two amino acid residues within the metallopeptidase domain of Yta12 allows its assembly into homo-oligomeric complexes. To provide a molecular explanation, we determined the 12 \u00c5 resolution structure of the intact yeast m-AAA protease with its transmembrane domains by electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and atomic structure fitting. The full-length m-AAA protease has a bipartite structure and is a hexamer in solution. We found that residues in Yta12, which facilitate homo-oligomerization when mutated, are located at the interface between neighboring protomers in the hexamer ring. Notably, the transmembrane and intermembrane space domains are separated from the main body, creating a passage on the matrix side, which is wide enough to accommodate unfolded but not folded polypeptides. These results suggest a mechanism regarding how proteins are recognized and degraded by m-AAA proteases. Stress-triggered activation of the metalloprotease Oma1 involves its C-terminal region and is important for mitochondrial stress protection in yeast.\nprohibitin complex with a native molecular mass of approximately 2 MDa containing Phb1p and Phb2p forms a supercomplex with the m-AAA protease. Proteolysis of nonassembled inner membrane proteins by the m-AAA protease is accelerated in mitochondria lacking Phb1p or Phb2p, indicating a negative regulatory effect of prohibitins on m-AAA protease activity. These results functionally link members of two conserved protein families in eukaryotes to the degradation of membrane proteins in mitochondria.\nis a complex locus. m-AAA proteases, mitochondrial calcium homeostasis and neurodegeneration. The function of mitochondria depends on ubiquitously expressed and evolutionary conserved m-AAA proteases in the inner membrane. These ATP-dependent peptidases form hexameric complexes built up of homologous subunits. AFG3L2 subunits assemble either into homo-oligomeric isoenzymes or with SPG7 (paraplegin) subunits into hetero-oligomeric proteolytic complexes. Mutations in AFG3L2 are associated with dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA28) characterized by the loss of Purkinje cells, whereas mutations in SPG7 cause a recessive form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP7) with motor neurons of the cortico-spinal tract being predominantly affected. Pleiotropic functions have been assigned to m-AAA proteases, which act as quality control and regulatory enzymes in mitochondria. Loss of m-AAA proteases affects mitochondrial protein synthesis and respiration and leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and deficiencies in the axonal transport of mitochondria. Moreover m-AAA proteases regulate the assembly of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex. Impaired\norganizer. Here, we report that SLP2 anchors a large protease complex composed of the rhomboid protease PARL and the i-AAA protease YME1L, which we term the SPY complex (for SLP2-PARL-YME1L). Association with SLP2 in the SPY complex regulates PARL-mediated processing of PTEN-induced kinase PINK1 and the phosphatase PGAM5 in mitochondria. Moreover, SLP2 inhibits the stress-activated peptidase OMA1, which can bind to SLP2 and cleaves PGAM5 in depolarized mitochondria. SLP2 restricts OMA1-mediated processing of the dynamin-like GTPase OPA1 allowing stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion under starvation conditions. Together, our results reveal an important role of SLP2 membrane scaffolds for the spatial organization of IM proteases regulating mitochondrial dynamics, quality control, and cell survival. Characterization of Mitochondrial YME1L Protease Oxidative Stress-Induced Conformational State. Oxidative stress is a common challenge to mitochondrial function where reactive oxygen species are capable of significant organelle damage. The generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species occurs in the inner membrane\nElectron cryomicroscopy structure of a membrane-anchored mitochondrial AAA protease. FtsH-related AAA proteases are conserved membrane-anchored, ATP-dependent molecular machines, which mediate the processing and turnover of soluble and membrane-embedded proteins in eubacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. Homo- and hetero-oligomeric proteolytic complexes exist, which are composed of homologous subunits harboring an ATPase domain of the AAA family and an H41 metallopeptidase domain. Mutations in subunits of mitochondrial m-AAA proteases have been associated with different neurodegenerative disorders in human, raising questions on the functional differences between homo- and hetero-oligomeric AAA proteases. Here, we have analyzed the hetero-oligomeric yeast m-AAA protease composed of homologous Yta10 and Yta12 subunits. We combined genetic and structural approaches to define the molecular determinants for oligomer assembly and to assess functional similarities between Yta10 and Yta12. We demonstrate that replacement of only two amino acid residues within the metallopeptidase domain of Yta12 allows its assembly into homo-oligomeric complexes. To provide\nassay suitable for high-throughput drug screening. The assay utilizes an engineered luciferase targeted to the inner membrane as artificial OMA1 substrate, whereby the reporter signal inversely correlates to OMA1 activity. Testing different screening protocols and sampling different compound collections validated the reporter and demonstrated that both OMA1 activators as well as OMA1 inhibitors can be identified with the assay. Ten kinase-targeted cancer drugs triggered OMA1 in the assays, which suggests\u2500considering cardiotoxicity as a rather common side-effect of this class of drugs\u2500cross-reactivity with the OMA1 pathway. The Mitochondrial PHB2/OMA1/DELE1 Pathway Cooperates with Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress to Facilitate the Response to Chemotherapeutics in Ovarian Cancer. Interactions between the mitochondrial inner and outer membranes and between mitochondria and other organelles closely correlates with the sensitivity of ovarian cancer to cisplatin and other chemotherapeutic drugs. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Recently, the mitochondrial protease OMA1, which regulates internal and external signals in mitochondria\nand regulates ribosome assembly, thus exerting essential housekeeping functions within mitochondria. Mutations in the m-AAA protease subunit paraplegin cause axonal degeneration in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), but the basis for the unexpected tissue specificity is not understood. Paraplegin assembles with homologous Afg3l2 subunits into hetero-oligomeric complexes which can substitute for yeast m-AAA proteases, demonstrating functional conservation. The function of a third paralogue, Afg3l1 expressed in mouse, is unknown. Here, we analyze the assembly of paraplegin into m-AAA complexes and monitor consequences of paraplegin deficiency in HSP fibroblasts and in a mouse model for HSP. Our findings reveal variability in the assembly of m-AAA proteases in mitochondria in different tissues. Homo-oligomeric Afg3l1 and Afg3l2 complexes and hetero-oligomeric assemblies of both proteins with paraplegin can be formed. Yeast complementation studies demonstrate the proteolytic activity of these assemblies. Paraplegin deficiency in HSP does not result in the loss of m-AAA protease activity in\nof the presence of CDDP. Prohibitin 1 (Phb1) dissociates from Opa1-Phb1 complex and binds phosphorylated p53 (serine 15) in response to CDDP in chemosensitive but not chemoresistant CECA cells. These findings demonstrate that (a) p53 and Oma1 mediate L-Opa1 processing, (b) mitochondrial fragmentation is involved in CDDP-induced apoptosis in OVCA and CECA cells, and (c) dysregulated mitochondrial dynamics may in part be involved in the pathophysiology of CDDP resistance. Prohibitin levels regulate OMA1 activity and turnover in neurons. The GTPase OPA1 and the AAA-protease OMA1 serve well-established roles in mitochondrial stress responses and mitochondria-initiated cell death. In addition to its role in mitochondrial membrane fusion, cristae structure, and bioenergetic function, OPA1 controls apoptosis by sequestering cytochrome c (cyt c) in mitochondrial cristae. Cleavage of functional long OPA1 (L-OPA1) isoforms by OMA1 inactivates mitochondrial fusion and primes apoptosis. OPA1 cleavage is regulated by the prohibitin (PHB) complex, a heteromeric, ring-shaped mitochondrial\ncomplex, and these alterations likely involve C-terminal residues of the protease. Substitutions in the conserved C-terminal region of Oma1 impair its ability to form a labile proteolytically active complex in response to stress stimuli. We demonstrate that Oma1 genetically interacts with other inner membrane-bound quality control proteases. These findings indicate that yeast Oma1 is an important player in IM protein homeostasis and integrity by acting in concert with other intramitochondrial quality control components. Redox Regulation of the Mitochondrial Quality Control Protease Oma1. Aims: Normal mitochondrial function and integrity are crucial for cellular physiology. Given the paramount role of mitochondrial quality control proteases in these processes, our study focused on investigating mechanisms by which the activity of a key quality control protease Oma1 is regulated under normal conditions and in response to homeostatic insults. Results: Oma1 was found to be a redox-dependent protein that exists in a semi-oxidized state in yeast\nbasal state) reduces eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and affects cell growth. In agreement, pharmacological potentiation of integrated stress response via Sephin-1, a drug that selectively inhibits the stress-induced eIF2alpha phosphatase GADD34 (encoded by Ppp1r15a), improved cell growth of SPAX5 fibroblasts and cell survival and dendritic arborization ex vivo in primary Afg3l2-/- Purkinje neurons. Notably, Sephin-1 treatment in vivo extended the lifespan of Afg3l2-/- mice, improved Purkinje neuron morphology, mitochondrial ultrastructure and respiratory capacity. These data indicate that activation of the OMA1-DELE1-HRI pathway is protective in the context of SPAX5. Pharmacological tuning of the integrated stress response may represent a future therapeutic strategy for SPAX5 and other cerebellar ataxias caused by impaired mitochondrial proteostasis. OMA1 High-Throughput Screen Reveals Protease Activation by Kinase Inhibitors. Mitochondrial proteases are interesting but challenging drug targets for multifactorial diseases, such as neurodegeneration and cancer. The mitochondrial inner membrane protease OMA1 is a bona fide drug target for heart\noxygen species are capable of significant organelle damage. The generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species occurs in the inner membrane and matrix compartments as a consequence of subunit function in the electron transport chain and citric acid cycle, respectively. Maintenance of mitochondrial proteostasis and stress response is facilitated by compartmentalized proteases that couple the energy of ATP hydrolysis to unfolding and the regulated removal of damaged, misfolded, or aggregated proteins. The mitochondrial protease YME1L functions in the maintenance of proteostasis in the intermembrane space. YME1L is an inner membrane-anchored hexameric protease with distinct N-terminal, transmembrane, AAA+ (ATPases associated with various cellular activities), and C-terminal M41 zinc-dependent protease domains. The effect of oxidative stress on enzymes such as YME1L tasked with maintaining proteostasis is currently unclear. We report here that recombinant YME1L undergoes a reversible conformational change in response to oxidative stress that involves the interaction of one hydrogen peroxide molecule\nand reveals the novel conserved mechanism of the redox-dependent regulation of Oma1. Conclusion: Disulfide bonds formed by IMS-exposed residues Cys272 and Cys332 play an important evolutionarily conserved role in the regulation of Oma1 function. We propose that the redox status of these cysteines may act as a redox-tunable switch to optimize Oma1 proteolytic function for specific cellular conditions or homeostatic challenges. The membrane scaffold SLP2 anchors a proteolytic hub in mitochondria containing PARL and the i-AAA protease YME1L. The SPFH (stomatin, prohibitin, flotillin, HflC/K) superfamily is composed of scaffold proteins that form ring-like structures and locally specify the protein-lipid composition in a variety of cellular membranes. Stomatin-like protein 2 (SLP2) is a member of this superfamily that localizes to the mitochondrial inner membrane (IM) where it acts as a membrane organizer. Here, we report that SLP2 anchors a large protease complex composed of the rhomboid protease PARL and the i-AAA\nto homeostatic insults. Results: Oma1 was found to be a redox-dependent protein that exists in a semi-oxidized state in yeast and mammalian mitochondria. Biochemical and genetic analyses provide evidence that activity and stability of the Oma1 oligomeric complex can be dynamically tuned in a reduction/oxidation-sensitive manner. Mechanistically, these features appear to be mediated by two intermembrane space (IMS)-exposed highly conserved cysteine residues, Cys272 and Cys332. These residues form a disulfide bond, which likely plays a structural role and influences conformational stability and activity of the Oma1 high-mass complex. Finally, in line with these findings, engineered Oma1 substrate is shown to engage with the protease in a redox-sensitive manner. Innovation: This study provides new insights into the function of the Oma1 protease, a central controller of mitochondrial membrane homeostasis and dynamics, and reveals the novel conserved mechanism of the redox-dependent regulation of Oma1. Conclusion: Disulfide bonds formed by IMS-exposed residues Cys272\nproteases. Stress-triggered activation of the metalloprotease Oma1 involves its C-terminal region and is important for mitochondrial stress protection in yeast. Functional integrity of mitochondria is critical for optimal cellular physiology. A suite of conserved mitochondrial proteases known as intramitochondrial quality control represents one of the mechanisms assuring normal mitochondrial function. We previously demonstrated that ATP-independent metalloprotease Oma1 mediates degradation of hypohemylated Cox1 subunit of cytochrome c oxidase and is active in cytochrome c oxidase-deficient mitochondria. Here we show that Oma1 is important for adaptive responses to various homeostatic insults and preservation of normal mitochondrial function under damage-eliciting conditions. Changes in membrane potential, oxidative stress, or chronic hyperpolarization lead to increased Oma1-mediated proteolysis. The stress-triggered induction of Oma1 proteolytic activity appears to be associated with conformational changes within the Oma1 homo-oligomeric complex, and these alterations likely involve C-terminal residues of the protease. Substitutions in the conserved C-terminal region of Oma1 impair",

Our structure-based functional analysis on the cytoplasmic N-terminal tetramerization domain T1 of the voltage-gated channel, Kv1.2, uncovered a new function for this domain, modulation of voltage gating, and suggested a possible means of communication between second messenger pathways and Kv channels. A yeast screen for active Kir3.2 channels subjected to random mutagenesis has identified residues in the transmembrane segments that are crucial for controlling the opening of Kir3.2 channels. The identification of structural elements involved in potassium channel gating in these systems highlights principles that may be important in the regulation of other types of channels. Calmodulin Regulates Human Ether \u00e0 Go-Go 1 (hEAG1) Potassium Channels through Interactions of the Eag Domain with the Cyclic Nucleotide Binding Homology Domain* The ether \u00e0 go-go family of voltage-gated potassium channels is structurally distinct.

Together these data indicate that KCNE1 and KCNE3 interact directly with Kv12.2 channels to regulate channel membrane trafficking. Structural and functional characterization of Kv6.2 a new gamma-subunit of voltage-gated potassium channel. We have cloned and functionally expressed Kv6.2, a new member of the Kv6 subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channel subunits. The human Kv6.2 (KCNF2) gene was mapped at 18q22-18q23. Kv6.2 mRNA is preferentially expressed in rat and human myocard. Rat and human Kv6.2 subunits appear to be unable to form functional Kv channels in a heterologous expression system, but, when coexpressed with Kv2.1 alpha subunits, heteromultimeric Kv channels were formed mediating voltage-activated delayed-rectifier type outward currents. Their kinetics and conductance-voltage relationship were different from those mediated by homomultimeric Kv2.1 channels. Yeast two-hybrid reporter assays indicated that Kv6.2 amino-termini are able to interact specifically with the Kv2.1 amino-terminus.

Bimodal regulation of an Elk subfamily K+ channel by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) regulates Shaker K+ channels and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in a bimodal fashion by inhibiting voltage activation while stabilizing open channels. Bimodal regulation is conserved in hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, but voltage activation is enhanced while the open channel state is destabilized. The proposed sites of PIP2 regulation in these channels include the voltage-sensor domain (VSD) and conserved regions of the proximal cytoplasmic C terminus. Relatively little is known about PIP2 regulation of Ether-\u00e1-go-go (EAG) channels, a metazoan-specific family of K+ channels that includes three gene subfamilies, Eag (Kv10), Erg (Kv11), and Elk (Kv12). We examined PIP2 regulation of the Elk subfamily potassium channel human Elk1 to determine whether\nthe inositol-1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3) receptor complex, which contributes to the interaction of Bcl-2 with Bec1 and is required for Bcl-2 to functionally antagonize Bec1-mediated autophagy. This work provides mechanistic insights into how autophagy- and apoptosis-regulatory molecules crosstalk at the ER. 14-3-3\u03b8 is a binding partner of rat Eag1 potassium channels. The ether-\u00e0-go-go (Eag) potassium (K(+)) channel belongs to the superfamily of voltage-gated K(+) channel. In mammals, the expression of Eag channels is neuron-specific but their neurophysiological role remains obscure. We have applied the yeast two-hybrid screening system to identify rat Eag1 (rEag1)-interacting proteins from a rat brain cDNA library. One of the clones we identified was 14-3-3\u03b8, which belongs to a family of small acidic protein abundantly expressed in the brain. Data from in vitro yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays suggested that the direct association with 14-3-3\u03b8 was mediated by both the N- and the C-termini of rEag1. Co-precipitation\nvoltage-gated rat ether-\u00e0-go-go potassium channel. The specific assembly of subunits to oligomers is an important prerequisite for producing functional potassium channels. We have studied the assembly of voltage-gated rat ether-\u00e0-go-go (r-eag) potassium channels with two complementary assays. In protein overlay binding experiments it was shown that a 41-amino-acid domain, close to the r-eag subunit carboxy-terminus, is important for r-eag subunit interaction. In an in vitro expression system it was demonstrated that r-eag subunits lacking this assembly domain cannot form functional potassium channels. Also, a approximately 10-fold molar excess of the r-eag carboxy-terminus inhibited in co-expression experiments the formation of functional r-eag channels. When the r-eag carboxy-terminal assembly domain had been mutated, the dominant-negative effect of the r-eag carboxy-terminus on r-eag channel expression was abolished. The results demonstrate that a carboxy-terminal assembly domain is essential for functional r-eag potassium channel expression, in contrast to the one of Shaker-related potassium channels, which\nare modulators of channel activity that may link signaling pathways, or the cell cycle, to EAG and thus to various potassium channel functions. KCNE1 and KCNE3 beta-subunits regulate membrane surface expression of Kv12.2 K(+) channels in vitro and form a tripartite complex in vivo. Voltage-gated potassium channels that activate near the neuronal resting membrane potential are important regulators of excitation in the nervous system, but their functional diversity is still not well understood. For instance, Kv12.2 (ELK2, KCNH3) channels are highly expressed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and although they are most likely to contribute to resting potassium conductance, surprisingly little is known about their function or regulation. Here we demonstrate that the auxiliary MinK (KCNE1) and MiRP2 (KCNE3) proteins are important regulators of Kv12.2 channel function. Reduction of endogenous KCNE1 or KCNE3 expression by siRNA silencing, significantly increased macroscopic Kv12.2 currents in Xenopus oocytes by around 4-fold. Interestingly,\nlinker or the CNBHD. Here we present a 2 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of the eag domain-CNBHD complex of the mouse EAG1 (also known as KCNH1) channel. It displays extensive interactions between the eag domain and the CNBHD, indicating that the regulatory mechanism of the eag domain primarily involves the CNBHD. Notably, the structure reveals that a number of LQT2 mutations at homologous positions in human ERG, in addition to cancer-associated mutations in EAG channels, localize to the eag domain-CNBHD interface. Furthermore, mutations at the interface produced marked effects on channel gating, demonstrating the important physiological role of the eag domain-CNBHD interaction. Our structure of the eag domain-CNBHD complex of mouse EAG1 provides unique insights into the physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of KCNH channels. Carboxy-terminal domain mediates assembly of the voltage-gated rat ether-\u00e0-go-go potassium channel. The specific assembly of subunits to oligomers is an important prerequisite for producing functional potassium\ndepolarized potentials. Deletion of either the eagD or cNBHD abolished the inhibition by Ca2+i. However, deletion of just the PAS-cap resulted in a >15-fold potentiation in response to elevated Ca2+i. Mutations of residues at the interface between the eagD and cNBHD have been linked to human cancer. Glu-600 on the cNBHD, when substituted with residues with a larger volume, resulted in hEAG1 currents that were profoundly potentiated by Ca2+i in a manner similar to the \u0394PAS-cap mutant. These findings provide the first evidence that eagD and cNBHD interactions are regulating Ca2+-dependent gating and indicate that the binding of the PAS-cap with the cNBHD is required for the closure of the channels upon CaM binding. Introduction The ether \u00e0 go-go potassium channel family (KCNH)2 of voltage-gated potassium channels consists of three subgroups, ether \u00e0 go-go (EAG), EAG-related gene (ERG), and EAG-like potassium (ELK) channels. In recent years, most of the focus\neag domain. The KCNH voltage-dependent potassium channels (ether-\u00e0-go-go, EAG; EAG-related gene, ERG; EAG-like channels, ELK) are important regulators of cellular excitability and have key roles in diseases such as cardiac long QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2), epilepsy, schizophrenia and cancer. The intracellular domains of KCNH channels are structurally distinct from other voltage-gated channels. The amino-terminal region contains an eag domain, which is composed of a Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain and a PAS-cap domain, whereas the carboxy-terminal region contains a cyclic nucleotide-binding homology domain (CNBHD), which is connected to the pore through a C-linker domain. Many disease-causing mutations localize to these specialized intracellular domains, which underlie the unique gating and regulation of KCNH channels. It has been suggested that the eag domain may regulate the channel by interacting with either the S4-S5 linker or the CNBHD. Here we present a 2 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of the eag domain-CNBHD complex of the\nassays suggested that the direct association with 14-3-3\u03b8 was mediated by both the N- and the C-termini of rEag1. Co-precipitation of the two proteins was confirmed in both heterologous HEK293T cells and native hippocampal neurons. Electrophysiological studies showed that over-expression of 14-3-3\u03b8 led to a sizable suppression of rEag1 K(+) currents with no apparent alteration of the steady-state voltage dependence and gating kinetics. Furthermore, co-expression with 14-3-3\u03b8 failed to affect the total protein level, membrane trafficking, and single channel conductance of rEag1, implying that 14-3-3\u03b8 binding may render a fraction of the channel locked in a non-conducting state. Together these data suggest that 14-3-3\u03b8 is a binding partner of rEag1 and may modulate the functional expression of the K(+) channel in neurons. The structural mechanism of KCNH-channel regulation by the eag domain. The KCNH voltage-dependent potassium channels (ether-\u00e0-go-go, EAG; EAG-related gene, ERG; EAG-like channels, ELK) are important regulators of cellular\nchannels open and close in response to neurotransmitters and intracellular messengers. Here, we examine this question for potassium channels, an extraordinarily diverse group of ion channels. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels control action-potential waveforms and neuronal firing patterns by opening and closing in response to membrane-potential changes. These effects can be strongly modulated by cytoplasmic factors such as kinases, phosphatases, and small GTPases. A Kv alpha subunit contains six transmembrane segments, including an intrinsic voltage sensor. In contrast, inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels have just two transmembrane segments in each of its four pore-lining alpha subunits. A variety of intracellular second messengers mediate transmitter and metabolic regulation of Kir channels. For example, Kir3 (GIRK) channels open on binding to the G protein betagamma subunits, thereby mediating slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in the brain. Our structure-based functional analysis on the cytoplasmic N-terminal tetramerization domain T1 of the voltage-gated channel, Kv1.2, uncovered a\nto stabilize the open state also requires these residues, suggesting an overlap in sites central to the opposing effects of PIP2 on channel gating. Open-state stabilization in Elk1 requires the N-terminal eag domain (PAS domain + Cap), and PIP2-dependent stabilization is enhanced by a conserved basic residue (K5) in the Cap. Our data shows that PIP2 can bimodally regulate voltage gating in EAG family channels, as has been proposed for Shaker and HCN channels. PIP2 regulation appears fundamentally different for Elk and KCNQ channels, suggesting that, although both channel types can regulate action potential threshold in neurons, they are not functionally redundant.

It is proposed that this protein protein interaction underlies Kv2.1/Kv6.2 subunit assembly and the expression of functional heteromultimeric Kv2.1/Kv6.2 channels. The most resiliant feature of the Kv2.1/Kv6.2 channels was their submicromolar sensitivity to the antiarrhythmic drug propafenone. The data suggest that delayed-rectifier type channels containing Kv6.2 subunits may contribute to cardiac action potential repolarization. Distribution and functional properties of human KCNH8 (Elk1) potassium channels.

Here we report the distribution and functional properties of a member of the human Elk K+ channel gene family, KCNH8.

Dissociation of hERG complexes containing Hsp70 and\nErg (Kv11), and Elk (Kv12). We examined PIP2 regulation of the Elk subfamily potassium channel human Elk1 to determine whether bimodal regulation is conserved within the EAG K+ channel family. Open-state stabilization by PIP2 has been observed in human Erg1, but the proposed site of regulation in the distal C terminus is not conserved among EAG family channels. We show that PIP2 strongly inhibits voltage activation of Elk1 but also stabilizes the open state. This stabilization produces slow deactivation and a mode shift in voltage gating after activation. However, removal of PIP2 has the net effect of enhancing Elk1 activation. R347 in the linker between the VSD and pore (S4-S5 linker) and R479 near the S6 activation gate are required for PIP2 to inhibit voltage activation.

Myc and Mondo proteins are key regulators of cell growth, proliferation, and energy metabolism, yet often overlooked is their vital role in cell migration. Complex networks of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions control the transcriptional activity of Myc and MondoA confounding their functional analysis in higher eukaryotes. Here we report the identification of the transcriptional activation arm of a simplified Myc-like network in Caenorhabditis elegans. This network comprises an Mlx ortholog, named MXL-2 for Max-like 2, and a protein that has sequence features of both Myc and Mondo proteins, named MML-1 for Myc and Mondo-like 1. MML-1/MXL-2 complexes have a primary function in regulating migration of the ray 1 precursor cells in the male tail. MML-1/MXL-2 complexes control expression of ECM components in the non-migratory epidermis, which we propose contributes to the substratum required for\nmultiple signaling pathways, it is still not understood how ILK integrates and controls complex cellular signals. A more global analysis of ILK-protein complexes will give important insights in the complexity of ILK-dependent signal transduction. Here, we applied a SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture)-based proteomics approach to discover novel ILK-interacting proteins. Of 752 proteins identified in ILK immunoprecipitates, 24 proteins had SILAC ratios higher than PINCH, previously identified as direct ILK-binding partner. Some of the newly identified proteins specifically enriched in ILK immunoprecipitates, with potentially interesting roles in ILK biology, include rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (Rictor), alpha- and beta-tubulin, RuvB-like 1 and 2, HS1-associating protein 1 (HAX-1), T-complex protein 1 subunits, and Ras-GTP-ase activating-like protein 1 (IQ-GAP1). Functional interactions between ILK and several of the new binding partners were confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation/Western blot and colocalization experiments. Detailed analysis showed that when ILK is found in a\nbinding partners were confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation/Western blot and colocalization experiments. Detailed analysis showed that when ILK is found in a complex with alpha-tubulin and RuvB-like 1, alpha-parvin and PINCH are not present, suggesting that ILK has the ability to form distinct protein complexes throughout the cell. Inhibition of ILK activity with an ILK-kinase inhibitor QLT0267 or downregulation of its expression impaired the ability of RuvB-like 1 to bind to tubulin pointing toward a possible role of ILK in the regulation of RuvB-like 1/tubulin interaction. Using the power of quantitative proteomics to resolve specific from nonspecific protein interactions, we identified several novel ILK-binding proteins, which sheds light on the molecular mechanisms of regulation of ILK-dependent signal transduction.\nMML-1/MXL-2 complexes control expression of ECM components in the non-migratory epidermis, which we propose contributes to the substratum required for migration of the neighboring ray 1 precursor cells. Furthermore, we show that pro-migratory Wnt/beta-catenin and semaphorin signaling pathways interact genetically with MML-1/MXL-2 to determine ray 1 position. This first functional analysis of the Myc superfamily in C. elegans suggests that MondoA and Myc may have more predominant roles in cell migration than previously appreciated, and their cooperation with other pro-migratory pathways provides a more integrated view of their role in cell migration. HYPK coordinates degradation of polyneddylated proteins by autophagy. Selective degradation of protein aggregates by macroautophagy/autophagy is an essential homeostatic process of safeguarding cells from the effects of proteotoxicity. Among the ubiquitin-like proteins, NEDD8 conjugation to misfolded proteins is prominent in stress-induced protein aggregates, albeit the function of neddylation in autophagy is unclear. Here, we report that polyneddylation functions\npodocan, and podocan protein was added to differentiation culture medium. qRT-PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence were performed to investigate the effects of podocan on MDSC differentiation. Confocal microscopy and western blotting were used to assess the nuclear translocation and expression of \u03b2-catenin. An inhibitor and activator of \u03b2-catenin were used to assess the effects of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway on MDSC differentiation. We inhibited \u03b2-catenin while overexpressing podocan in MDSCs. Then, we performed mass spectrometry to identify which proteins interact with podocan to regulate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Finally, we confirmed the relationship between podocan and Wnt4 by co-immunoprecipitation and western blotting.RESULTS: Podocan protein expression increased significantly during bovine MDSC differentiation. Differentiation of bovine MDSC was promoted and suppressed by podocan overexpression or inhibition, respectively. Podocan was also shown to modulate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Treatment of bovine MDSCs with \u03b2-catenin inhibitor and activator showed that the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is\nprominent in stress-induced protein aggregates, albeit the function of neddylation in autophagy is unclear. Here, we report that polyneddylation functions as a post-translational modification for autophagic degradation of proteotoxic-stress induced protein aggregates. We also show that HYPK functions as an autophagy receptor in the polyneddylation-dependent aggrephagy. The scaffolding function of HYPK is facilitated by its C-terminal ubiquitin-associated domain and N-terminal tyrosine-type LC3-interacting region which bind to NEDD8 and LC3 respectively. Both NEDD8 and HYPK are positive modulators of basal and proteotoxicity-induced autophagy, leading to protection of cells from protein aggregates, such as aggregates of mutant HTT exon 1. Thus, we propose an indispensable and additive role of neddylation and HYPK in clearance of protein aggregates by autophagy, resulting in cytoprotective effect during proteotoxic stress.Abbreviations: ATG5, autophagy related 5; ATG12, autophagy related 12; ATG14, autophagy related 14; BECN1, beclin 1; CBL, casitas B-lineage lymphoma; CBLB, Cbl proto-oncogene B; GABARAP, GABA type\nmodulate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Treatment of bovine MDSCs with \u03b2-catenin inhibitor and activator showed that the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is involved in bovine MDSC differentiation. Furthermore, the effect of podocan on bovine MDSC differentiation was suppressed when this pathway was inhibited. We also found that podocan interacts with Wnt4. When Wnt4 was inhibited, podocan-induced promotion of bovine MDSC differentiation was attenuated through Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling.CONCLUSION: Podocan regulates Wnt/\u03b2-catenin through Wnt4 to promote bovine MDSC differentiation. Mapping the integrin-linked kinase interactome using SILAC. Protein-protein interactions play an essential role in the regulation of vital biological functions. Through a network of interactions, integrin-linked kinase (ILK) functions downstream of integrin receptors to control cell spreading, migration, growth, survival, and cell cycle progression. Despite many reports on the role of ILK in the regulation of multiple signaling pathways, it is still not understood how ILK integrates and controls complex cellular signals. A more global analysis\nD. Podocan Promotes Differentiation of Bovine Skeletal Muscle Satellite Cells by Regulating the Wnt4-\u03b2-Catenin Signaling Pathway. BACKGROUND: Small leucine-rich repeat proteins (SLRPs) are highly effective and selective modulators of cell proliferation and differentiation. Podocan is a newly discovered member of the SLRP family. Its potential roles in the differentiation of bovine muscle-derived satellite cells (MDSCs) and its underlying functional mechanism remain unclear. Our study aimed to characterize the function of the podocan gene in the differentiation of bovine MDSCs and to clarify the molecular mechanism by which podocan functions in order to contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism by which extracellular matrix promotes bovine MDSC differentiation and provide a theoretical basis for the improvement of beef quality.METHODS: Bovine MDSCs were transfected with vectors to overexpress or inhibit podocan, and podocan protein was added to differentiation culture medium. qRT-PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence were performed to investigate the",

However, overexpression of full-length ZNF143, ZNF76, or dominant-negative DNA-binding domain of ZNF143 enhanced, maintained, or abolished transaldolase promoter activity, respectively, in HepG2 and HeLa cells, suggesting that ZNF143 initiates transcription from the transaldolase core promoter. ZNF143 overexpression also increased transaldolase enzyme activity. ZNF143 and transaldolase expression correlated in 21 different human tissues and were coordinately upregulated 14- and 34-fold, respectively, in lactating mammary glands compared with nonlactating ones. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies confirm that ZNF143/73 associates with the transaldolase promoter in vivo. Thus, ZNF143 plays a key role in basal and tissue-specific expression of transaldolase and regulation of the metabolic network controlling cell survival and differentiation. Snapshots of catalysis: the structure of fructose-1,6-(bis)phosphate aldolase covalently bound to the substrate dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Fructose-1,6-bis(phosphate) aldolase is an essential glycolytic enzyme found in all vertebrates and higher plants that catalyzes the cleavage of fructose 1,6-bis(phosphate) (Fru-1,6-P(2)) to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP).\nall vertebrates and higher plants that catalyzes the cleavage of fructose 1,6-bis(phosphate) (Fru-1,6-P(2)) to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). Mutations in the aldolase genes in humans cause hemolytic anemia and hereditary fructose intolerance. The structure of the aldolase-DHAP Schiff base has been determined by X-ray crystallography to 2.6 A resolution (R(cryst) = 0.213, R(free) = 0.249) by trapping the catalytic intermediate with NaBH(4) in the presence of Fru-1,6-P(2). This is the first structure of a trapped covalent intermediate for this essential glycolytic enzyme. The structure allows the elucidation of a comprehensive catalytic mechanism and identification of a conserved chemical motif in Schiff-base aldolases. The position of the bound DHAP relative to Asp33 is consistent with a role for Asp33 in deprotonation of the C4-hydroxyl leading to C-C bond cleavage. The methyl side chain of Ala31 is positioned directly opposite the C3-hydroxyl, sterically favoring the S-configuration of the substrate at\npathway. The minimal promoter sufficient to drive chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene activity was mapped to nucleotides -49 to -1 relative to the transcription start site of the human transaldolase gene. DNase I footprinting with nuclear extracts of transaldolase-expressing cell lines unveiled protection of nucleotides -29 to -16. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays identified a single dominant DNA-protein complex that was abolished by consensus sequence for transcription factor ZNF143/76 or mutation of the ZNF76/143 motif within the transaldolase promoter. Mutation of an AP-2alpha recognition sequence, partially overlapping the ZNF143 motif, increased TAL-H promoter activity in HeLa cells, without significant impact on HepG2 cells, which do not express AP-2alpha. Cooperativity of ZNF143 with AP-2alpha was supported by supershift analysis of HeLa cells where AP-2 may act as cell type-specific repressor of TAL promoter activity. However, overexpression of full-length ZNF143, ZNF76, or dominant-negative DNA-binding domain of ZNF143 enhanced, maintained, or abolished transaldolase promoter activity,\neffusion B-cell lymphoma. KSHV induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) early during infection of human dermal microvascular endothelial (HMVEC-d) cells that are critical for virus entry. One of the downstream targets of ROS is nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor with important anti-oxidative functions. Here, we show that KS skin lesions have high Nrf2 activity compared to healthy skin tissue. Within 30 minutes of de novo KSHV infection of HMVEC-d cells, we observed Nrf2 activation through ROS-mediated dissociation from its inhibitor Keap1, Ser-40 phosphorylation, and subsequent nuclear translocation. KSHV binding and consequent signaling through Src, PI3-K and PKC-\u03b6 were also important for Nrf2 stability, phosphorylation and transcriptional activity. Although Nrf2 was dispensable for ROS homeostasis, it was essential for the induction of COX-2, VEGF-A, VEGF-D, Bcl-2, NQO1, GCS, HO1, TKT, TALDO and G6PD gene expression in KSHV-infected HMVEC-d cells. The COX-2 product PGE2 induced Nrf2 activity through paracrine\nHO1, TKT, TALDO and G6PD gene expression in KSHV-infected HMVEC-d cells. The COX-2 product PGE2 induced Nrf2 activity through paracrine and autocrine signaling, creating a feed-forward loop between COX-2 and Nrf2. vFLIP, a product of KSHV latent gene ORF71, induced Nrf2 and its target genes NQO1 and HO1. Activated Nrf2 colocalized with the KSHV genome as well as with the latency protein LANA-1. Nrf2 knockdown enhanced ORF73 expression while reducing ORF50 and other lytic gene expression without affecting KSHV entry or genome nuclear delivery. Collectively, these studies for the first time demonstrate that during de novo infection, KSHV induces Nrf2 through intricate mechanisms involving multiple signal molecules, which is important for its ability to manipulate host and viral genes, creating a microenvironment conducive to KSHV infection. Thus, Nrf2 is a potential attractive target to intervene in KSHV infection and the associated maladies. Proteomic analysis of osteoarthritic chondrocyte reveals the hyaluronic\npotential attractive target to intervene in KSHV infection and the associated maladies. Proteomic analysis of osteoarthritic chondrocyte reveals the hyaluronic acid-regulated proteins involved in chondroprotective effect under oxidative stress. Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common type of arthritis, is a degenerative joint disease. Oxidative stress is well known to play important roles in cartilage degradation and pathogenesis of OA. The intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid (IAHA) is accepted as an effective clinical therapy for OA, but we do not yet fully understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of HA on OA chondrocytes under oxidative stress. Here, we show for the first time that IAHA significantly reduces the synovial fluid levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O2(-)) in patients with knee OA. We also demonstrate that HA suppresses H2O2-induced cell death in human OA chondrocytes. Proteomic approaches (2-DE combined with mass spectrometry) allowed us to identify 13 protein spots corresponding to\nin human OA chondrocytes. Proteomic approaches (2-DE combined with mass spectrometry) allowed us to identify 13 protein spots corresponding to 12 non-redundant proteins as HA-regulated proteins in OA chondrocytes under oxidative stress. The expression levels of three putative HA-regulated proteins (TALDO, ANXA1 and EF2) in control, H2O2-, HA- and HA/H2O2-treated OA chondrocytes were verified by Western blotting and the results indeed support the notion that HA acts in anti-oxidation, anti-apoptosis, and the promotion of cell survival. Our results collectively demonstrate the utility of proteomic approaches and provide new insights into the chondroprotective effects of HA on OA.BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In the present study, we show for the first time that IAHA reduces the levels of H2O2 and O2(-) in synovial fluids from OA patients. We used primary cultured human OA chondrocytes as a model, treated cells with H2O2 to partly mimic their physiological conditions under oxidative stress, and examined the protection\nCrystal structure of transaldolase B from Escherichia coli suggests a circular permutation of the alpha/beta barrel within the class I aldolase family. BACKGROUND: Transaldolase is one of the enzymes in the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. It transfers a C3 ketol fragment from a ketose donor to an aldose acceptor. Transaldolase, together with transketolase, creates a reversible link between the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis. The enzyme is of considerable interest as a catalyst in stereospecific organic synthesis and the aim of this work was to reveal the molecular architecture of transaldolase and provide insights into the structural basis of the enzymatic mechanism.RESULTS: The three-dimensional (3D) structure of recombinant transaldolase B from E. coli was determined at 1.87 A resolution. The enzyme subunit consists of a single eight-stranded alpha/beta-barrel domain. Two subunits form a dimer related by a twofold symmetry axis. The active-site residue Lys132 which forms a\npatients with wild type NPM1 compared to patients with NPM1 mutation. This study demonstrates the potential of quantitative proteomics in AML classification and risk stratification.BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Patients diagnosed with AML are currently categorized according to cellular morphology, cytogenetic alterations and mutations, although the majority of these cellular and genetic alterations have no or unsolved impact on therapy selection or prognosis. We therefore explored the phosphoproteome for abundance changes associated with traditional classifiers to unravel patterns that could stratify patients at the protein level. MOES, ANXA5 and EFHD2 were confirmed by SRM to be correlated to monocytic differentiation, whilst TALDO was elevated in NPM1 wild type patients. ZNF143 mediates basal and tissue-specific expression of human transaldolase. Transaldolase regulates redox-dependent apoptosis through controlling NADPH and ribose 5-phosphate production via the pentose phosphate pathway. The minimal promoter sufficient to drive chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene activity was mapped to nucleotides -49 to -1 relative\nallergen is a transaldolase. A corresponding full-length 1246 bp cDNA encoding a polypeptide of 325 residues was isolated. The newly identified transaldolase allergen has been designated as Cla c 14.0101. The cDNA encoding the Pencillium chrysogenum transaldolase was isolated by RT-PCR according to the cDNA sequence encoding a P. chrysogenum Wisconsin 54-1255 hypothetical protein. The purified rCla c 14.0101 protein reacted with IgE antibodies in 10 (38%) of 26 Cladosporium cladosporioides-sensitized asthmatic patients. Nine of the 10 rCla c 14.0101-positive sera have IgE binding against the recombinant Penicillium transaldolase (rPen ch 35.0101). Among the eight fungal transaldolase-positive sera tested, three showed IgE binding against the recombinant human transaldolase. To determine cross-reactivity between the Cladosporium and Penicillium fungi, IgE cross-reactivity was detected between these two fungal transaldolase allergens by inhibition assays. Both the N- and the C-terminal fragments of Cla c 14.0101 were recognized by IgE antibodies. The C-terminal IgE-reacting determinant\nidentification of a conserved Lys-Glu dyad involved in Schiff-base formation and breakdown. The overlay highlights the fact that Lys146 in aldolase is replaced in transaldolase with Asn35. The substitution in transaldolase stabilizes the enamine intermediate required for the attack of the second aldose substrate, changing the chemistry from aldolase to transaldolase. Transaldolases are novel and immunoglobulin E cross-reacting fungal allergens. BACKGROUND: Mould-induced atopic respiratory diseases are a worldwide problem. Characterization of fungal allergens is of major clinical importance.OBJECTIVE: We identified a novel transaldolase family allergen of Cladosporium and Penicillium species.METHODS: Fungal allergens were identified by immunoblotting, peptide mass mapping and partial sequencing, cDNA cloning and IgE epitope mapping.RESULTS: A 36.5 kDa IgE-binding component in a partially purified C. cladosporioides preparation was identified. Mass spectrometric analyses suggest that this novel IgE-reacting allergen is a transaldolase. A corresponding full-length 1246 bp cDNA encoding a polypeptide of 325 residues was isolated. The newly\nalpha/beta-barrel domain. Two subunits form a dimer related by a twofold symmetry axis. The active-site residue Lys132 which forms a Schiff base with the substrate is located at the bottom of the active-site cleft.CONCLUSIONS: The 3D structure of transaldolase is similar to structures of other enzymes in the class I aldolase family. Comparison of these structures suggests that a circular permutation of the protein sequence might have occurred in transaldolase, which nevertheless results in a similar 3D structure. This observation provides evidence for a naturally occurring circular permutation in an alpha/beta-barrel protein. It appears that such genetic permutations occur more frequently during evolution than was previously thought. Phosphoprotein DIGE profiles reflect blast differentiation, cytogenetic risk stratification, FLT3/NPM1 mutations and therapy response in acute myeloid leukaemia. Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is an aggressive blood cancer characterized by a distinct block in differentiation of myeloid progenitors, recurrent chromosomal translocations and gene mutations\nThe methyl side chain of Ala31 is positioned directly opposite the C3-hydroxyl, sterically favoring the S-configuration of the substrate at this carbon. The \"trigger\" residue Arg303, which binds the substrate C6-phosphate group, is a ligand to the phosphate group of DHAP. The observed movement of the ligand between substrate and product phosphates may provide a structural link between the substrate cleavage and the conformational change in the C-terminus associated with product release. The position of Glu187 in relation to the DHAP Schiff base is consistent with a role for the residue in protonation of the hydroxyl group of the carbinolamine in the dehydration step, catalyzing Schiff-base formation. The overlay of the aldolase-DHAP structure with that of the covalent enzyme-dihydroxyacetone structure of the mechanistically similar transaldolase and KDPG aldolase allows the identification of a conserved Lys-Glu dyad involved in Schiff-base formation and breakdown. The overlay highlights the fact that Lys146 in\nBoth the N- and the C-terminal fragments of Cla c 14.0101 were recognized by IgE antibodies. The C-terminal IgE-reacting determinant was narrowed down to a region encompassing Thr257 to Ser278 of Cla c 14.0101. It was mapped onto a loop-like structure of a 3D model constructed for Cla c 14.0101.CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: We identified transaldolase as a novel and IgE cross-reactive allergen family of C. cladosporioides and P. chrysogenum. In addition, an IgE-reacting fragment (Thr257 to Ser278) was pinpointed to a loop-like structure on Cla c 14.0101. Results obtained provide important information in clinical mould allergy. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus induces Nrf2 during de novo infection of endothelial cells to create a microenvironment conducive to infection. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiological agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and primary effusion B-cell lymphoma. KSHV induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) early during infection of human dermal microvascular endothelial (HMVEC-d) cells that\nan aggressive blood cancer characterized by a distinct block in differentiation of myeloid progenitors, recurrent chromosomal translocations and gene mutations of which >50% involve signal transduction through dysregulated kinases and phosphatases. In search for novel protein biomarkers for disease stratification we investigated the phosphoproteome in leukaemic cells from 62 AML patients at time of diagnosis using immobilized metal-affinity chromatography, protein separation by two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mass spectrometry before validation by selected reaction monitoring (SRM). Unsupervised clustering found 27 phosphoproteins significantly discriminating patients according to leukaemic cell differentiation (French-American-British (FAB) classification), cytogenetic and mutational (FLT3, NPM1) status or response to chemotherapy. Monocytic differentiation (FAB M4-M5) correlated with enrichment of proteins involved in apoptosis (MOES, ANXA5 and EFHD2). TALDO, a protein associated with thrombocytopenia if down-regulated, was elevated in patients with wild type NPM1 compared to patients with NPM1 mutation. This study demonstrates the potential of quantitative proteomics in\nas a model, treated cells with H2O2 to partly mimic their physiological conditions under oxidative stress, and examined the protection effects of HA. The proteomic approach allowed us to identify candidate proteins regulated by H2O2 and/or HA in OA chondrocytes. We found that proteins functioning in stress responses, apoptosis and protein synthesis were consistently regulated by HA in chondrocytes under oxidative stress. These novel results contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HA-mediated chondroprotection.",

HIF-1alpha is stabilized, translocates to the nucleus, interacts with hypoxia-responsive elements, and promotes the activation of target genes. This report shows that cyclosporin A (CsA) interferes with the hypoxic signaling cascade in C6 glioma cells. CsA inhibits hypoxia-dependent gene transcription in a reporter gene assay and prevents the hypoxic accumulation of HIF-1alpha. Addition of the 530-603 C-terminal oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain of HIF-1alpha to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) destabilized the protein in an oxygen-dependent manner. CsA prevented the hypoxic stabilization of an ODD.GFP fusion protein. An assay for 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases was developed using a light mitochondrial kidney fraction as a source of enzyme. It uses the capacity of specific peptides to stimulate the degradation of [(14)C]2-oxoglutarate.

The enzyme promoted [(35)S]vHL binding to glutathione S-transferase (GST).ODD fusion protein. This association increased in the presence of CsA. CsA effects were not observed when the proline residue corresponding to Pro-564 in the HIF-1alpha sequence was replaced by a hydroxyproline or an alanine residue. Finally, CsA increased vHL-ODD interaction during hypoxia. We conclude that CsA destabilizes HIF-1alpha by promoting hydroxylation of Pro-564 in the ODD domain. Such a mechanism may prevent hypoxic adaptation during CsA-induced nephrotoxicity and contribute to the adverse effects of this drug. Dominant negative AT2 receptor oligomers induce G-protein arrest and symptoms of neurodegeneration. Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) correlates with dysfunction of signaling mediated by Galphaq/11. Nondissociable angiotensin II AT2 receptor oligomers are linked to the impaired Galphaq/11-stimulated signaling of AD patients and transgenic mice with AD-like\nrapid proteasomal degradation. The HIFalpha hydroxylases belong to a superfamily of dioxygenases that require the co-substrates oxygen and 2-oxoglutarate as well as the cofactors Fe2+ and ascorbate. The regulation of enzyme turnover by the concentration of the cosubstrate oxygen constitutes the interface between tissue oxygen level and the activity of HIF. The HIFalpha prolyl hydroxylases, termed PHDs/EGLNs (prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins/EGL nine homologues), bind to a conserved Leu-Xaa-Xaa-Leu-Ala-Pro motif present in all substrates identified so far. This recognition motif is present twice in HIF1alpha, which gives rise to a NODD [N-terminal ODD (oxygen-dependent degradation domain)] containing Pro402 of HIF1alpha and a CODD (C-terminal ODD) where Pro564 is hydroxylated. PHD1/EGLN2 and PHD2/EGLN1 hydroxylate both ODDs with higher activity towards CODD, whereas PHD3/EGLN3 is specific for CODD. The reason for this behaviour has been unclear. In this issue of the Biochemical Journal, Villar and colleagues demonstrate that distinct PHD/EGLN domains, that are\nAT2-R-mediated cardioprotection, vasodilation and pressure natriuresis. These effects, transmitted by AT2-R, are mainly exerted by stimulation of protein tyrosine or serine/threonine phosphatases in a Gi-protein-dependent manner. The expression level of AT2-R is much higher in human hearts than in rodent hearts, and the AT2-R-mediated actions are likely enhanced, especially by clinical application of AT1-R antagonists. Thus, in this review, the regulation of AT2-R expression, its cellular localization, its pathological role in cardiovascular and kidney diseases, and pharmacotherapeutic effects of AT2-R stimulation are discussed. Pathophysiological role of angiotensin II type 2 receptor in cardiovascular and renal diseases. Since the discovery of nonpeptidic ligands, the receptors for angiotensin (Ang) II have been classified into 2 subtypes (Ang II type 1 receptor [AT1-R] and Ang II type 2 receptor [AT2-R]). AT1-R mediates most of the cardiovascular actions of Ang II. AT2-R is expressed at very high levels in the developing fetus. Its expression\nangiotensin II AT2 receptor oligomers are linked to the impaired Galphaq/11-stimulated signaling of AD patients and transgenic mice with AD-like symptoms. To further analyze the role of AT2 receptor oligomers, we induced the formation of AT2 oligomers in an in vitro cell system. Similarly as in vivo, sequential oxidative and transglutaminase-dependent cross-linking steps triggered the formation of AT2 oligomers in vitro. Elevated reactive oxygen species mediated oxidative cross-linking of AT2 monomers to dimers involving tyrosine residues located at putative interreceptor contact sites of the cytoplasmic loop connecting transmembrane helices III/IV. Cross-linked AT2 dimers were subsequently a substrate of activated transglutaminase-2, which targeted the carboxyl terminus of AT2 dimers, as assessed by truncated and chimeric AT2 receptors, respectively. AT2 oligomers acted as dominant negative receptors in vitro by mediating Galphaq/11 protein sequestration and Galphaq/11 protein arrest. The formation of AT2 oligomers and G-protein dysfunction could be suppressed in vitro and in\nThe angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor: an enigmatic seven transmembrane receptor. Angiotensin II (AngII) interacts with two receptor subtypes, AT1 and AT2, belonging to the seven transmembrane receptor superfamily. Pharmacological investigations initially suggested that AT2 receptors antagonize AT1 effects. Data from AT2 receptor transgenic and knock-out mice have not been entirely consistent with this interpretation. At the cellular level, a clear mechanistic model of AT2 transduction and signalling has yet to emerge. The AT2 receptor displays the hallmark motifs and signature residues of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), but fails to demonstrate most of the classic features of GPCR signalling. In recent years, unbiased screens for AT2-interacting proteins have identified novel partner proteins involved in AT2 signalling, providing new insight into the mechanisms of AT2 action. A growing body of evidence suggests that the AT2 receptor is constitutively active (i.e. signals without AngII). This review critically evaluates controversies surrounding\nand lack of involvement of DRY motif), suggest that the cascade of events in these two signaling mechanisms could be similar, and that an oocyte-specific SHP1-like protein may be involved in AT2-mediated cGMP reduction in these cells. Enzyme substrate recognition in oxygen sensing: how the HIF trap snaps. The transcriptional activator HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) is a focal point of biomedical research because many situations in physiology and in pathology coincide with hypoxia. The effects of HIF activation may be a facet of normal growth, as in embryonic development, they may counterbalance a disease, as seen in the stimulation of erythropoiesis in anaemia, and they may be part of the pathological processes, as exemplified by tumour angiogenesis. The oxygen-sensitive alpha-subunits of HIF are primarily regulated by the enzymatic hydroxylation that induces rapid proteasomal degradation. The HIFalpha hydroxylases belong to a superfamily of dioxygenases that require the co-substrates oxygen and 2-oxoglutarate as\nhas been unclear. In this issue of the Biochemical Journal, Villar and colleagues demonstrate that distinct PHD/EGLN domains, that are remote from the catalytic site, function in substrate discrimination. This elegant study improves our understanding of the interaction of the oxygen-sensing PHDs/EGLNs with their substrates, which include, but are not limited to, the HIFalpha proteins. [Angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor signal and cardiovascular action]. Due to the discovery of nonpeptic ligands, the receptors for angiotensin (Ang) II are classified into two subtypes (AT1-R and AT2-R). AT1-R mediates most of the cardiovascular actions of Ang II. AT2-R is expressed at very high levels in the developing fetus. Its expression is very low in the cardiovascular system of the adult. The expression of AT2-R can be modulated by pathological states associated with tissue remodeling or inflammation. In failing hearts or neointima formation after vascular injury, AT2-R is reexpressed in cells proliferating\nsequestration and Galphaq/11 protein arrest. The formation of AT2 oligomers and G-protein dysfunction could be suppressed in vitro and in vivo by an AT2 receptor mutant. Inhibition of AT2 oligomerization upon stereotactic expression of the AT2 receptor mutant revealed that Galphaq/11-sequestering AT2 oligomers enhanced the development of neurodegenerative symptoms in the hippocampus of transgenic mice with AD-like pathology. Thus, AT2 oligomers inducing Galphaq/11 arrest are causally involved in inducing symptoms of neurodegeneration. Cardiac-specific overexpression of angiotensin II AT2 receptor causes attenuated response to AT1 receptor-mediated pressor and chronotropic effects. Angiotensin (Ang) II has two major receptor isoforms, AT1 and AT2. Currently, AT1 antagonists are undergoing clinical trials in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Treatment with AT1 antagonists causes elevation of plasma Ang II which selectively binds to AT2 and exerts as yet undefined effects. Cardiac AT2 level is low in adult hearts, whereas its distribution ratio is increased during cardiac remodeling\nthe region spanning the third ICL and carboxy terminus of the AT2 receptor. Since the third ICL of the AT2 receptor is essential for exerting its inhibitory effects on cell growth, possible involvement of this region in the interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of the ErbB3 receptor suggests a novel signaling mechanism for the AT2 receptor mediated inhibition of cell growth. Furthermore, since both the AT2 and the ErbB3 receptors are expressed during fetal development, we propose that the existence of direct interaction between these two receptors may play a role in the regulation of growth during the initial stages of development. Cyclosporin A prevents the hypoxic adaptation by activating hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha Pro-564 hydroxylation. The mechanism by which hypoxia induces gene transcription involves the inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha prolyl hydroxylase activity, which prevents von Hippel-Lindau (vHL)-dependent targeting of HIF-1alpha to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. HIF-1alpha is stabilized, translocates to the\ninhibition of Ang II-induced chronotropic or pressor actions, suggesting the role of AT2-R on the activity of cardiac pacemaker cells and the maintenance of vascular resistance. AT2-R also activates the kinin/nitric oxide/cGMP system in the cardiovascular and renal systems, resulting in AT2-R-mediated cardioprotection, vasodilation, and pressure natriuresis. These effects, transmitted by AT2-R, are mainly exerted by stimulation of protein tyrosine or serine/threonine phosphatases in a Gi protein-dependent manner. The expression level of AT2-R is much higher in human hearts than in rodent hearts, and the AT2-R-mediated actions are likely enhanced, especially by clinical application of AT1-R antagonists. Thus, in this review, the regulation of AT2-R expression, its cellular localization, its pathological role in cardiovascular and kidney diseases, and pharmacotherapeutic effects of AT2-R stimulation are discussed.\nfor ATP binding of the ErbB3 and ErbB2 receptors, was identified to be interacting with the AT2 receptor. The interaction between the human ErbB3 receptor and the AT2 receptor was further confirmed using the cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 671-782) of the human ErbB3 receptor. Moreover, an AT2 receptor peptide that spans the amino acids 226-363, (spans the third ICL and carboxy terminal domain) could also interact with the AT2 receptor in a yeast Two-Hybrid protein-protein interaction assay. Studies using mutated and chimeric AT2 receptors showed that replacing the third intracellular loop (ICL) of the AT2 receptor with that of the AT1 abolishes the interaction between the ErbB3 and the AT2 in yeast Two-Hybrid protein-protein interaction assay. Thus the interaction between the AT2 receptor and the ErbB3 receptor seems to require the region spanning the third ICL and carboxy terminus of the AT2 receptor. Since the third ICL of the AT2\nand 3rd intracellular loops of AT2 on AT2-mediated cGMP reduction. Mutating the highly conserved DRY motif (D141G-R142G-Y143A) of the 2nd ICL implicated in activating G(alpha) subunit of trimeric G-proteins did not affect AT2-mediated cGMP reduction. Moreover, anti-Gialpha antibody or phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX did not inhibit AT2-mediated cGMP reduction, suggesting that Gialpha activation and subsequent phosphodiesterase activation are not involved in this function. In contrast, mutations T250R-R251N and L255F-K256R located in the C-terminus of the 3rd ICL of AT2 retained ligand-binding properties of the wild-type AT2, and its ability to interact with the ErbB3 in yeast two-hybrid assay, but abolished AT2-mediated cGMP reduction. Similarities in the roles of ICLs of AT2 in AT2-mediated cGMP reduction in oocytes, and AT2-mediated SHP1 activation in COS-7 cells, (need of 3rd ICL for both functions and lack of involvement of DRY motif), suggest that the cascade of events in these two signaling mechanisms could be\nTG mice was not influenced by AT2 activation, this study suggested that overexpression of AT2 decreases the sensitivity of pacemaker cells to Ang II. Our results demonstrate that stimulation of cardia AT2 exerts a novel antipressor action by inhibiting AT1-mediated chronotropic effects, and that application of AT1 antagonists to patients with cardiovascular diseases has beneficial pharmacotherapeutic effects of stimulating cardiac AT2. Roles of the intracellular regions of angiotensin II receptor AT2 in mediating reduction of intracellular cGMP levels. We have shown previously that the angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor AT2 reduces the intracellular levels of cGMP in Xenopus oocytes when activated by ligand binding, and the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the AT2 acts as a negative regulator of this function. Here we report the effects of mutations in the 2nd and 3rd intracellular loops of AT2 on AT2-mediated cGMP reduction. Mutating the highly conserved DRY motif (D141G-R142G-Y143A) of the 2nd\nyet undefined effects. Cardiac AT2 level is low in adult hearts, whereas its distribution ratio is increased during cardiac remodeling and its action is enhanced by application of AT1 antagonists. Although in AT2 knock-out mice sensitivity to the pressor action of Ang II was increased, underlying mechanisms remain undefined. Here, we report the unexpected finding that cardiac-specific overexpression of the AT2 gene using alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter resulted in decreased sensitivity to AT1-mediated pressor and chronotropic actions. AT2 protein undetectable in the hearts of wild-type mice was overexpressed in atria and ventricles of the AT2 transgenic (TG) mice and the proportions of AT2 relative to AT1 were 41% in atria and 45% in ventricles. No obvious morphological change was observed in the myocardium and there was no significant difference in cardiac development or heart to body weight ratio between wild-type and TG mice. Infusion of Ang II to AT2 TG\ncardiac development or heart to body weight ratio between wild-type and TG mice. Infusion of Ang II to AT2 TG mice caused a significantly attenuated increase in blood pressure response and the change was completely blocked by pretreatment with AT2 antagonist. This decreased sensitivity to Ang II-induced pressor action was mainly due to the AT2-mediated strong negative chronotropic effect and exerted by circulating Ang II in a physiological range that did not stimulate catecholamine release. Isolated hearts of AT2 transgenic mice perfused using a Langendorff apparatus also showed decreased chronotropic responses to Ang II with no effects on left ventricular dp/dt max values, and Ang II-induced activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase was inhibited in left ventricles in the transgenic mice. Although transient outward K+ current recorded in cardiomyocytes from AT2 TG mice was not influenced by AT2 activation, this study suggested that overexpression of AT2 decreases the sensitivity of pacemaker\nwith tissue remodeling or inflammation. In failing hearts or neointima formation after vascular injury, AT2-R is reexpressed in cells proliferating in interstitial regions or neointima and exerts an inhibitory effect on Ang II-induced mitogen signals or synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins, resulting in attenuation of the tissue remodeling. An extreme form of cell growth inhibition ends in programmed cell death, and this process, which is initiated by the withdrawal of growth factors, is also enhanced by AT2-R. Cardiac myocyte- or vascular smooth muscle-specific mice that overexpress AT2-R display an inhibition of Ang II-induced chronotropic or pressor actions, suggesting the role of AT2-R on the activity of cardiac pacemaker cells and the maintenance of vascular resistance. AT2-R also activates the kinin/nitric oxide/cGMP system in the cardiovascular and renal systems, resulting in AT2-R-mediated cardioprotection, vasodilation and pressure natriuresis.

This review critically evaluates controversies surrounding physiological functions and signalling mechanisms of the AT2 receptor, primarily in a cardiovascular context. Recent advances in the field are highlighted and findings challenging the concept that the AT2 receptor is a conventional angiotensin receptor are considered. Identification of an interaction between the angiotensin II receptor sub-type AT2 and the ErbB3 receptor, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family. To identify the proteins that interact and mediate angiotensin II receptor AT2-specific signaling, a random peptide library was screened by yeast-based Two-Hybrid protein-protein interaction assay technique. A peptide that shared significant homology with the amino acids located between the residues Gly-Xaa-Gly-Xaa-Xaa-Gly721 and Lys742, the residues predicted to be important for ATP binding of the ErbB3 and ErbB2 receptors, was identified to be interacting with the AT2 receptor.

Until now, only yeast TSC10 has been identified as a KDS reductase gene. Here, we provide evidence that the human FVT-1 (hFVT-1) and mouse FVT-1 (mFVT-1) are functional mammalian KDS reductases. The forced expression of hFVT-1 or mFVT-1 in TSC10-null yeast cells suppressed growth defects, and hFVT-1 overproduced in cultured cells exhibited KDS reductase activity in vitro. Moreover, purified recombinant hFVT-1 protein exhibited NADPH-dependent KDS reductase activity. The identification of the FVT-1 genes enabled us to characterize the mammalian KDS reductase at the molecular level. Northern blot analyses demonstrated that both hFVT-1 and mFVT-1 mRNAs are ubiquitously expressed, suggesting that FVT-1 is a major KDS reductase. We also found the presence of hFVT-1 variants, which were differentially expressed among tissues. Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis revealed that hFVT-1 is\nCrystal structure of the 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase TSC10 from Cryptococcus neoformans. The second step in the de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis is the reduction of 3-ketodihydrosphingosine by 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase (KDSR) to produce dihydrosphingosine (sphinganine). Fungal TSC10 and mammalian KDSR (also named FVT-1) proteins are the enzymes responsible for this process and they belong to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. Albeit that both fungal and mammalian 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductases were identified more than a decade ago, no structure of these enzymes from any species has been experimentally determined. Here we report the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of TSC10 from Cryptococcus neoformans in complex with NADPH. cnTSC10 adopts a Rossmann fold with a central seven-stranded \u03b2-sheet flanked by \u03b1-helices on both sides. Several regions are disordered that include the segment connecting the serine and tyrosine residues of the catalytic triad, the so-called 'substrate loop', and the C-terminal region that often participates in homo-tetramerization\nreductase fragments of plant nitrate reductase at high levels in Pichia pastoris. Mo reductase (MoR; formerly cytochrome c reductase) fragments of NADH:NO(3) reductase (NR; EC1.6.6.1) were cytosolically expressed in Pichia pastoris, a methylotrophic yeast, using spinach (Spinacia oleracea) and corn (Zea maize) cDNAs. In fermenter cultures, spinach MoR was expressed at 420 mg L(-1), corn MoR at 32 mg L(-1), and corn MoR plus with putative NR interface domain N terminus (MoR+) at 17 mg L(-1). Constitutively expressed MoR+ was structurally stable while it was degraded when expressed by methanol induction, which suggests methanol growth produces more proteinase.

MoR was monomeric and MoR+ dimeric, confirming the predicted role for dimer interface domain of NR.

Sphingolipids are essential membrane components of eukaryotic cells. Their synthesis is initiated with the condensation of l-serine with palmitoyl-CoA, producing 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (KDS), followed by a reduction to dihydrosphingosine\nhydroxylase (subunit structure (alpha beta gamma)2) is shown to significantly change the electronic environment of the mu-(H/R)-oxo-bridged binuclear iron cluster of the hydroxylase in both the mixed valent (Fe(II).Fe(III)) and fully reduced (Fe(II).Fe(II)) states. Protein-protein complexes between the reductase and component B as well as between the reductase and hydroxylase have been shown to form by monitoring quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence spectrum of either the component B (KD approximately 0.4 microM) or hydroxylase (two binding sites, KDa approximately 10 nM, KDb approximately 8 microM). The observed KD values are in agreement with the best fit values from the kinetic simulation. Through the use of the covalent zero length cross-linking reagent 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC), the binding sites of the component B and reductase were shown to be on the hydroxylase alpha and beta subunits, respectively. The alpha and beta subunits of the hydroxylase are cross-linked by EDC suggesting that they are\ndeacetylase activity as described in. Cell fractions were incubated with 0.143 \u03bcCi 14C-CA (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) in 26 nmol total CA for 1 h at 30\u00b0C. The assay was stopped by adding 1.5 vol of CHCl3. Three volumes of methanol were added and the reaction was vortexed until clear. Ortho-phosphoric acid (2.8%, 1.5 vol) was added and the samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 13,000 rpm. The upper aqueous layer was discarded. Samples were re-extracted with 1.5 vol CHCl3 and 3 vol acidified water. The lower organic layer was collected and dried under nitrogen. The dried sample was resuspended in CHCl3:methanol (1:1), loaded onto silica gel TLC plates, run in petroleum ether:diethyl ether:acetic acid (70:30:2), and dried. Plates were exposed to a phosphor screen for 2\u20133 days and compared with iodine-labeled standards. RESULTS PCP yields a distinct LD purification profile LDs were isolated from WT yeast grown at 30\u00b0C\nand tyrosine residues of the catalytic triad, the so-called 'substrate loop', and the C-terminal region that often participates in homo-tetramerization in other SDRs. In addition, the cofactor NADPH is not fully ordered. These structural features indicate that the catalytic site of cnTSC10 possesses significant flexibility. cnTSC10 is predominantly dimeric in solution while a minor portion of the protein forms homo-tetramer. The crystal structure reveals that the homo-dimer interface involves both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions mediated by helices \u03b14 and \u03b15, as well as the loop connecting strand \u03b24 and helix \u03b14. Because residues forming hydrogen bonds and salt bridges in the dimer interface are not conserved between fungal TSC10 and mammalian KDSR proteins, it might be possible to develop inhibitors that selectively target fungal TSC10 dimerization.

Mo reductase (MoR; formerly cytochrome c reductase) fragments\nfractionated as above. To reduce cytoplasm in the LD fraction, LDs in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes were rinsed twice by addition of 1 vol buffer, spun at maximum speed in a tabletop centrifuge, and a needle and syringe were inserted below the floating LDs to remove 1 vol cytoplasm. Pellets were rinsed twice and then resuspended in yeast cis-isoprenyl transferase (cis-IPTase) reaction buffer [60 mM HEPES (pH 8.5), 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM NaF, and 2 mM sodium orthovanadate]. Yeast reaction mixtures contained 100 \u03bcg protein, 50 \u03bcM farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), and 45 \u03bcM 14C-isopentyl pyrophosphate (IPP) (American Radiolabeled Chemicals). Reactions were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 1 h and quenched by addition of 2 ml CHCl3:methanol (2:1). Products were separated from unreacted water-soluble IPP by partition through addition of 0.8 ml of 0.9% NaCl in water. The organic phase was washed three times with CHCl3:methanol:water (3:48:47) and\nof the newly identified yeast LD proteins (Cab5, Rer2, Say1, Tsc10, and YPR147C) have human orthologs; and thus, the localization to LDs might also be important for functions of these proteins in humans. The functional homolog of Rer2, DHDDS (or hCIT), has been linked to retinitis pigmentosa. Human CoA synthase is a bifunctional enzyme (phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase and dephospho-CoA kinase activities) that catalyzes the last step of CoA synthesis, like Cab5. While sterol acetylation is a yeast-specific process, Say1 is orthologous to arylacetamide deacetylase, an enzyme putatively involved in TG hydrolysis. Tsc10 is functionally homologous to 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase (FVT1), known to be active at the cytosolic face of the ER and implicated in tumor processes. YPR147C is a highly conserved protein with a GXSXG lipase motif that has been shown to affect lipid storage in Drosophila and cholesterol ester storage in macrophages.

RESULTS PCP yields a distinct LD purification profile LDs were isolated from WT yeast grown at 30\u00b0C to stationary phase, where LDs are most abundant. To obtain the fractions for PCP, we purified LDs from cells labeled with heavy nonradioactive isotope-containing lysine [stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture, SILAC ] using sequential differential centrifugation and a sucrose density gradient. We collected samples from pellets of each initial centrifugation (fractions 1\u20133) and six layers of the sucrose density gradient (fractions 4\u20139). By using peptides identified in the various fractions, we found that the sequential centrifugations pelleted primarily the following: a) unbroken cells and agglomerated membrane in fraction 1; b) vacuolar, nuclear, ER, plasma, endosomal, and Golgi membranes in fraction 2; and c) transport vesicles, endosomal membranes, and Golgi complex in fraction 3. The sucrose density gradient separated the cytoplasm into six additional fractions. We combined\ncellular fractionation and immunoblotting, using mouse monoclonal anti-protein disulfide isomerase (Abcam), anti-GFP (Roche), and rabbit polyclonal anti-hemaggutinin (HA) (Upstate). For crude fractionation (e.g., in experiments of Fig. 5A, C and ), cells were dounce-homogenized and lysates spun at 300 g for 30 min and then 100,000 g for 30 min. LDs were collected with a tube slicer (Beckman Coulter) and the remaining supernatant and pellet were collected. TLC Lipids were extracted by bead beating cells in water:CHCl3:methanol (0.3:1:1), collecting the single phase, and drying it under N2 gas. Lipids were resuspended in chloroform, separated on silica gel TLC plates (Whatman or Analtech) using hexane:ethyl ether:acetic acid (80:20:1), and detected by charring with cuprous sulfate. Bands were identified by comparison to standards. LD purification Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) was performed.

Proteomes are\nof previously identified LD proteins in two experimental replicates. Second, proteins had to be above the arbitrary cutoff in both experimental replicates. Third, proteins had to have a calculable heavy/light ratio (H/L) in at least eight fractions so that we were confident that their cluster membership value was not strongly influenced by missing data points. Finally, proteins were filtered based on a purification profile that closely matched that of 12 well-established LD proteins (Fig. 3A). In the case of our analysis, these stringent criteria used the thresholds of H/L <0.06 in fractions 1\u20133, <0.16 in fractions 4\u20136, <0.2 in fraction 7, and <0.371 in fraction 8 (Fig. 1E). By including these selected thresholds, we were able to maximize specificity of the selected LD proteins. cis-Isoprenyl transferase assay Cells were crudely fractionated as above.

Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis revealed that hFVT-1 is localized at the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, a proteinase K digestion assay revealed that the large hydrophilic domain of hFVT-1, which contains putative active site residues, faces the cytosol. These results suggest that KDS is converted to dihydrosphingosine in the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Moreover, the topology studies provide insight into the spatial organization of the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway.

Flavonoids are secondary metabolites derived from phenylalanine and acetate metabolism. They fulfil a variety of functions in plants and have health benefits for humans. During the synthesis of the tricyclic flavonoid natural products in plants, oxidative modifications to the central C ring are catalyzed by four of FeII and 2-oxoglutarate dependent (2-ODD) oxygenases, namely flavone synthase I (FNS I), flavonol synthase (FLS), anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) and flavanone 3\u03b2-hydroxylase (FHT). FNS I, FLS and ANS are involved in desaturation of C2-C3 of flavonoids and FHT in hydroxylation of C3. FNS I, which is restricted to the Apiaceae species and in rice, is predicted to have evolved from FHT by duplication. Due to their sequence similarity and substrate specificity, FLS and ANS, which interact with the \u03b1 surface of the substrate, belong to a group of dioxygenases having a broad\nand ANS, which interact with the \u03b1 surface of the substrate, belong to a group of dioxygenases having a broad substrate specificity, while FNS I and FHT are more selective, and interact with the naringenin \u03b2 surface. Here, we summarize recent findings regarding the function of the four 2-ODD oxygenases and the relationship between their catalytic activity, their polypeptide sequence and their tertiary structure. ODDSOC2 is a MADS box floral repressor that is down-regulated by vernalization in temperate cereals. In temperate cereals, such as wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare), the transition to reproductive development can be accelerated by prolonged exposure to cold (vernalization). We examined the role of the grass-specific MADS box gene ODDSOC2 (OS2) in the vernalization response in cereals. The barley OS2 gene (HvOS2) is expressed in leaves and shoot apices but is repressed by vernalization. Vernalization represses OS2 independently of VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1) in a VRN1\nin leaves and shoot apices but is repressed by vernalization. Vernalization represses OS2 independently of VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1) in a VRN1 deletion mutant of einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum), but VRN1 is required to maintain down-regulation of OS2 in vernalized plants. Furthermore, barleys that carry active alleles of the VRN1 gene (HvVRN1) have reduced expression of HvOS2, suggesting that HvVRN1 down-regulates HvOS2 during development. Overexpression of HvOS2 delayed flowering and reduced spike, stem, and leaf length in transgenic barley plants. Plants overexpressing HvOS2 showed reduced expression of barley homologs of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) gene FLOWERING PROMOTING FACTOR1 (FPF1) and increased expression of RNase-S-like genes. FPF1 promotes floral development and enhances cell elongation, so down-regulation of FPF1-like genes might explain the phenotypes of HvOS2 overexpression lines. We present an extended model of the genetic pathways controlling vernalization-induced flowering in cereals, which describes the regulatory relationships between VRN1, OS2, and FPF1-like genes. Overall,\nthe genetic pathways controlling vernalization-induced flowering in cereals, which describes the regulatory relationships between VRN1, OS2, and FPF1-like genes. Overall, these findings highlight differences and similarities between the vernalization responses of temperate cereals and the model plant Arabidopsis.",

Conclusion Natural compounds have always been a richest source of active compounds with a wide variety of structures, therefore, these compounds showed a special inspiration for medical chemists. The present study has aimed molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies on taxifolin targeting W80R mutant protein of protein kinase B/serine- threonine kinase/AKT1 (EC:2.7.11.1) protein of ovarian cancer for designing therapeutic intervention. The expected result supported the molecular cause in a mutant form which resulted in a gain of ovarian cancer. Here we discussed validations computationally and yet experimental evaluation or in vivo studies are endorsed for further study. Several of these compounds should become the next marvels for early detection of ovarian cancer. Background Ovarian cancer marks the most lethal gynaecological malignancy which ranks the fifth marveling cause of cancer deaths in females . It is\ntreatment, and diagnostic perspectives. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that the expression of AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 was associated with poor patient survival . The marveling cause of the disease is due to genetic and epigenetic changes of the cellular genome. Numerous small drug molecules of AKT gene targeting mutations such as FOXO, glucose metabolism (GSK3), and apoptotic proteins (BAD, NF-kB, FKHR) are available. Cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair (MDM2) are critical in disease progression. Among various kinases, overexpression of AKT1 protein and associated mutations play a deciding role in cross-talk cell signalling in causing cancer. Recent studies have introduced assorted therapeutic agents as targets specific for cancer-driven factors involved in the inhibition of ovarian cancer development. One such factor of the kinase family is protein kinase B/serine-threonine (EC:2.7.11.1) (https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/index.php) serves as a decisive mediator of the P13K/AKT/mTOR cell signaling pathway that has distinct physiological functions such as\nGLI proteins. Nuclear Gene 33/Mig6 regulates the DNA damage response through an ATM serine/threonine kinase-dependent mechanism. Gene 33 (Mig6, ERRFI1) is an adaptor protein with multiple cellular functions. We recently linked Gene 33 to the DNA damage response (DDR) induced by hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), but the molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that ectopic expression of Gene 33 triggers DDR in an ATM serine/threonine kinase (ATM)-dependent fashion and through pathways dependent or not dependent on ABL proto-oncogene 1 non-receptor tyrosine kinase (c-Abl). We observed the clear presence of Gene 33 in the nucleus and chromatin fractions of the cell. We also found that the nuclear localization of Gene 33 is regulated by its 14-3-3-binding domain and that the chromatin localization of Gene 33 is partially dependent on its ErbB-binding domain. Our data further indicated that Gene 33 may regulate the targeting of c-Abl to chromatin. Moreover, we observed a\n(GM-CSF) and the interferons were thought to transmit their regulatory signals primarily by the receptor-associated Jak family of tyrosine kinases. This family of tyrosine kinases activates STAT transcription factors, which subsequently transduced their signals into the nucleus to modulate gene expression. Cytokine receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity such as c-Kit were initially thought to transduce their signals independently of serine/threonine kinase cascades. Recently, both of these types of receptor signaling pathways have been shown to interact with serine/threonine kinase pathways as maximal activation of these tyrosine kinase regulated cascades involve serine/threonine phosphorylation modulated by, for example MAP kinases. A common intermediate pathway initiating from cytokine receptors is the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK (MAPK) cascade, which can result in the phosphorylation and activation of additional downstream kinases and transcription factors such as p90Rsk, CREB, Elk and Egr-1. Serine/threonine phosphorylation is also involved in the regulation of the apoptosis-controlling Bcl-2 protein, as certain phosphorylation\n\u22123.3 \u22122.2 \u2212 3.9 3923.0 2167.6 \u22122.3 5,907,705.0 25.8 6.3 13.7 10.0 1.5 \u22123.3 \u22122.2 \u22123.9 3923.1 2167.7 \u22122.3 443,637.0 30.4 6.9 10.9 5.1 3.1 \u22125.8 \u22122.6 \u22125.4 2297.1 1215.5 \u22122.8 44,264,122.0 27.4 6.7 11.7 5.5 3.0 \u22124.8 \u2212 3.0 \u2212 4.5 1992.2 1042.1 \u22122.8 71,424,203.0 30.4 7.3 15.4 10.2 2.1 \u22124.3 \u2212 2.2 \u2212 4.4 4024.7 2228.4 \u22122.3 10,852,057.0 24.6 5.5 10.6 5.1 2.1 \u22123.2 \u22122.3 \u22124.0 3923.3 2167.8 \u22122.3 14,407,192.0 25.4 6.2 10.8 5.4 2.6 \u22124.3 \u22122.6 \u22124.3 1853.1 963.6 \u22122.8 19,792,482.0 29.5 7.5 18.3 5.3 3.3 \u22125.1 \u2212 3.4 \u2212 4.6 3892.8 10,000.0 \u22122.3 19,792,563.0 29.7 6.6 11.1 5.3 2.9 \u22124.6 \u22122.4 \u2212 4.6 3892.8 2149.6 \u22122.3 22,321,203.0 25.1 6.3 11.1 5.1 2.7 \u22124.5 \u22122.9 \u22124.6 1338.3 677.9 \u22123.0 24,952,793.0 30.3 \u22127.7 13.7 8.4 2.4 \u22124.9 \u22123.3 \u221218.3 1409.6 717.0 \u22122.7 24,952,797.0 26.6 \u22129.3 22.7 7.5 2.3 \u22124.3 \u22123.9 \u221217.7 1441.8 2759.8 \u22123.1 24,966,389.0 29.5 \u22128.5 13.8\nthe mitochondrial sheath, fibrous sheath, outer dense fiber, and axoneme. Stk33KI/KI male mice were subfertile and had oligoasthenozoospermia. Differential phosphoproteomic analysis and in vitro kinase assay identified novel phosphorylation substrates of STK33, fibrous sheath components A-kinase anchoring protein 3 and A-kinase anchoring protein 4, whose expression levels decreased in testis after deletion of Stk33. STK33 regulated the phosphorylation of A-kinase anchoring protein 3/4, affected the assembly of fibrous sheath in the sperm, and played an essential role in spermiogenesis and male infertility. Kr\u00fcppel-like Factor 4 Suppresses Serine/Threonine Kinase 33 Activation and Metastasis of Gastric Cancer through Reversing Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition. Background: Cancers with aberrant expression of Serine/threonine kinase 33 (STK33) has been reported to be particularly aggressive. However, its expression, clinical significance, and biological functions in gastric cancer remain largely unknown. In the present study, we determined the expression and function of STK33 in gastric cancer and delineated the clinical significance\nof the selected protein using its template was visualized by the PYMOL tool.

Serine/threonine phosphorylation is also involved in the regulation of the apoptosis-controlling Bcl-2 protein, as certain phosphorylation events induced by cytokines such as IL-3 are anti-apoptotic, whereas other phosphorylation events triggered by chemotherapeutic drugs such as Paclitaxel are associated with cell death. Serine/threonine phosphorylation is implicated in the etiology of certain human cancers as constitutive serine phosphorylation of STATs 1 and 3 is observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and can be inhibited by the chemotherapeutic drug fludarabine. Serine/threonine phosphorylation also plays a role in the etiology of immunodeficiencies. Activated STAT5 proteins are detected in reduced levels in lymphocytes recovered from HIV-infected individuals and immunocompromised mice. Serine/threonine phosphorylation may be an important target of certain chemotherapeutic drugs which recognize the activated proteins.

Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a serine/threonine phosphatase, which regulates the phosphorylation status of many proteins that are essential for cellular functions. IKAROS is a DNA-binding protein, which functions as a regulator of gene transcription in hematopoietic cells. CK2 directly phosphorylates IKAROS at multiple phosphosites which determines IKAROS activity as a regulator of gene expression. PP1 binds to IKAROS via the PP1-consensus recognition site and dephosphorylates serine/threonine residues that are phosphorylated by CK2. Thus, the interplay between CK2 and PP1 signaling pathways have opposing effects on the phosphorylation status of their mutual substrate - IKAROS. This review summarizes the effects of CK2 and PP1 on IKAROS role in regulation of gene expression and its function as a tumor suppressor in leukemia. The Serine/threonine kinase Stk33 exhibits autophosphorylation and phosphorylates the intermediate filament protein Vimentin. BACKGROUND: Colocalization of Stk33 with vimentin by double immunofluorescence in certain cells indicated that vimentin\n(EC:2.7.11.1) (https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/index.php) serves as a decisive mediator of the P13K/AKT/mTOR cell signaling pathway that has distinct physiological functions such as cell growth, survival, proliferation, and metabolism . Structurally AKT1 consists of three domains, including an N-terminal pleckstrin homology, a central catalytic kinases domain, and C-terminal domain. AKT1 is the kinase that connects upstream signals from PI3K and mammalian targets of rapamycin complex2 (mTORC2) with downstream signals to mTORC1 and effectors such as mTOR, GSK3b along with phosphorylation cascade which acts as substrates that induce cell cycle progression, protein synthesis, lipid and protein phosphatases, glucose metabolism and cell growth . AKT1 is mutated and AKT2 is amplified in about 40% AKT1 is inhibited by tumor suppressors including phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type 2 INPP4B. Therefore, targeting ATP binding cleft of AKT protein by inhibitors (natural/synthetic) has become an attractive strategy for treating patients in ovarian cancer.\nERRAT score of 81.99 in an acceptable protein environment.

Cellular functions are regulated by signal transduction pathway networks consisting of protein-modifying enzymes that control the activity of many downstream proteins. Protein kinases and phosphatases regulate gene expression by reversible phosphorylation of transcriptional factors, which are their direct substrates. Casein kinase II (CK2) is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates a large number of proteins that have critical roles in cellular proliferation, metabolism and survival. Altered function of CK2 has been associated with malignant transformation, immunological disorders and other types of diseases. Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a serine/threonine phosphatase, which regulates the phosphorylation status of many proteins that are essential\nHPD expression remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that molecular chaperone TTC36, which is highly expressed in liver, is associated with HPD and reduces the binding of protein kinase STK33 to HPD, thereby inhibiting STK33-mediated HPD T382 phosphorylation. The reduction of HPD T382 phosphorylation results in impaired recruitment of FHA domain-containing PELI1 and PELI1-mediated HPD polyubiquitylation and degradation. Conversely, deficiency or depletion of TTC36 results in enhanced STK33-mediated HPD T382 phosphorylation and binding of PELI1 to HPD and subsequent PELI1-mediated HPD downregulation. Ttc36-/- mice have reduced HPD expression in the liver and exhibit tyrosinemia, damage to hippocampal neurons, and deficits of learning and memory. These findings reveal a previously unknown regulation of HPD expression and highlight the physiological significance of TTC36-STK33-PELI1-regulated HPD expression in tyrosinemia and tyrosinemia-associated neurological disorders. Co-localization of serine/threonine kinase 33 (Stk33) and vimentin in the hypothalamus. We investigate the immunoreactivity of serine/threonine kinase 33 (Stk33) and\nspermatids, are critical to spermiogenesis, and are required for male fertility in mammals. To explore the role of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) in regulation of TSSKs, the stability and catalytic activity of epitope-tagged murine TSSKs were assessed in 293T and COS-7 cells. TSSK1, -2, -4, and -6 (small serine/threonine kinase) were all found to associate with HSP90, and pharmacological inhibition of HSP90 function using the highly specific drugs 17-AAG, SNX-5422, or NVP-AUY922 reduced TSSK protein levels in cells. The attenuation of HSP90 function abolished the catalytic activities of TSSK4 and -6 but did not significantly alter the specific activities of TSSK1 and -2. Inhibition of HSP90 resulted in increased TSSK ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, indicating that HSP90 acts to control ubiquitin-mediated catabolism of the TSSKs. To study HSP90 and TSSKs in germ cells, a mouse primary spermatid culture model was developed and characterized. Using specific antibodies against murine TSSK2\nwe have cloned human serine/threonine kinase ULK3 and assessed its ability to regulate GLI transcription factors, mediators of SHH signaling. We demonstrate that ULK3 enhances endogenous and over-expressed GLI1 and GLI2 transcriptional activity in cultured cells, as assessed by GLI-luciferase reporter assay. Besides that, ULK3 alters subcellular localization of GLI1, as assessed by immunofluorescent staining and immunoblotting assays. We show that ULK3 is an autophosphorylated kinase and phosphorylates GLI proteins in vitro. We also demonstrate that ULK3 catalytical activity is crucial for its function in SHH pathway. We show that ULK3 is widely expressed and its expression is higher in a number of tissues where Shh signaling is known to be active. Our data suggest that serine/threonine kinase ULK3 is involved in the SHH pathway as a positive regulator of GLI proteins. Nuclear Gene 33/Mig6 regulates the DNA damage response through an ATM serine/threonine kinase-dependent mechanism. Gene 33 (Mig6, ERRFI1)\nsphere formation and viability of primary human colon tumor-initiating cells harboring mutant KRAS. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the activity of HSP90 inhibitors in KRAS mutant cancer cells, indicate that the enhanced requirement for STK33 can be exploited to target mutant KRAS-driven tumors, and identify STK33 depletion through HSP90 inhibition as a biomarker-guided therapeutic strategy with immediate translational potential. STK33/ERK2 signal pathway contribute the tumorigenesis of colorectal cancer HCT15 cells. Serine/threonine kinase 33 (STK33) is a serine/threonine kinase and participates in many apoptotic process. Herein, we found that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) was a substrate of STK33. STK33 phosphorylated ERK2 and increased the activity of ERK2 and promote the tumorigenesis of colorectal cancer HCT15 cells. Clinical simple showed that STK33 was highly expression in colorectal cells and tissues. Ex vivo and in vivo studies demonstrated that STK33 accelerate tumorigenic properties in NCM460 cells and athymic nude rats.\ndiscuss the interactions of serine/threonine kinases with signal transduction and apoptotic molecules and how some of these pathways can be controlled by chemotherapeutic drugs. Leukemia (2000) 14, 9-21. Identification of a novel serine/threonine kinase ULK3 as a positive regulator of Hedgehog pathway. The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays crucial roles in embryonic development and is implicated in tissue homeostasis maintenance and neurogenesis in adults. Aberrant activation of Hh signaling is associated with various developmental abnormalities and several types of cancer. Genetic and biochemical studies ascertain serine/threonine kinase Fused (Fu) as a protein involved in Hh signaling in Drosophila. However, the role of Fu is not fully conserved in mammals suggesting involvement of other kinases in the mammalian Hh signaling pathway. In search of potential homologues to Drosophila and human Fu, we have cloned human serine/threonine kinase ULK3 and assessed its ability to regulate GLI transcription factors, mediators of SHH signaling.\nof serine/threonine kinase 33 (Stk33) and vimentin in the hypothalamus. We investigate the immunoreactivity of serine/threonine kinase 33 (Stk33) and of vimentin in the brain of mouse, rat and hamster. Using a Stk33-specific polyclonal antibody, we show by immunofluorescence staining that Stk33 is present in a variety of brain regions. We found a strong staining in the ependymal lining of all cerebral ventricles and the central canal of the spinal cord as well as in hypothalamic tanycytes. Stk33 immunoreactivity was also found in circumventricular organs such as the area postrema, subfornical organ and pituitary and pineal glands. Double-immunostaining experiments with antibodies against Stk33 and vimentin showed a striking colocalization of Stk33 and vimentin. As shown previously, Stk33 phosphorylates recombinant vimentin in vitro. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments and co-sedimentation assays indicate that Stk33 and vimentin are associated in vivo and that this association does not depend on further interacting partners (Brauksiepe et al.",

Crystal structure of Salmonella typhimurium 2-methylcitrate synthase: Insights on domain movement and substrate specificity. 2-Methylcitric acid (2-MCA) cycle is one of the well studied pathways for the utilization of propionate as a source of carbon and energy in bacteria such as Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. 2-Methylcitrate synthase (2-MCS) catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetate and propionyl-CoA to 2-methylcitrate and CoA in the second step of 2-MCA cycle. Here, we report the X-ray crystal structure of S. typhimurium 2-MCS (StPrpC) at 2.4\u00c5 resolution and its functional characterization. StPrpC was found to utilize propionyl-CoA more efficiently than acetyl-CoA or butyryl-CoA. The polypeptide fold and the catalytic residues of StPrpC are conserved in citrate synthases (CSs) suggesting similarities in their functional mechanisms. In the triclinic P1 cell, StPrpC molecules were organized as decamers composed of five identical\nPreliminary X-ray crystallographic analysis of 2-methylcitrate synthase from Salmonella typhimurium. Analysis of the genomic sequences of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium has revealed the presence of several homologues of the well studied citrate synthase (CS). One of these homologues has been shown to code for 2-methylcitrate synthase (2-MCS) activity. 2-MCS catalyzes one of the steps in the 2-methylcitric acid cycle found in these organisms for the degradation of propionate to pyruvate and succinate. In the present work, the gene coding for 2-MCS from S. typhimurium (StPrpC) was cloned in pRSET-C vector and overexpressed in E. coli. The protein was purified to homogeneity using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The purified protein was crystallized using the microbatch-under-oil method. The StPrpC crystals diffracted X-rays to 2.4 A resolution and belonged to the triclinic space group P1, with unit-cell parameters a = 92.068, b = 118.159, c = 120.659 A, alpha = 60.84, beta =\ngroup P1, with unit-cell parameters a = 92.068, b = 118.159, c = 120.659 A, alpha = 60.84, beta = 67.77, gamma = 81.92 degrees . Computation of rotation functions using the X-ray diffraction data shows that the protein is likely to be a decamer of identical subunits, unlike CSs, which are dimers or hexamers. A structure-based approach for the discovery of inhibitors against methylcitrate synthase of Paracoccidioides lutzii. Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic mycosis, endemic in Latin America, caused by fungi of the genus Paracoccidioides. The treatment of PCM is complex, requiring a long treatment period, which often results in serious side effects. The aim of this study was to screen for inhibitors of a specific target of the fungus that is absent in humans. Methylcitrate synthase (MCS) is a unique enzyme of microorganisms and is responsible for the synthesis of methylcitrate at the beginning of the propionate degradation\na unique enzyme of microorganisms and is responsible for the synthesis of methylcitrate at the beginning of the propionate degradation pathway. This pathway is essential for several microorganisms, since the accumulation of propionyl-CoA can impair virulence and prevent the development of the pathogen. We performed the modeling and molecular dynamics of the structure of Paracoccidioides lutzii MCS (PlMCS) and performed a virtual screening on 89,415 compounds against the active site of the enzyme. The compounds were selected according to the affinity and efficiency criteria of in vitro tests. Six compounds were able to inhibit the enzymatic activity of recombinant PlMCS but only the compound ZINC08964784 showed fungistatic and fungicidal activity against Paracoccidioides spp. cells. The analysis of the interaction profile of this compound with PlMCS showed its effectiveness in terms of specificity and stability when compared to the substrate (propionyl-CoA) of the enzyme.

In addition, this compound did not show cytotoxicity in mammalian cells, with an excellent selectivity index. Our results suggest that the compound ZINC08964784 may become a promising alternative antifungal against Paracoccidioides spp. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma. McSAS: software for the retrieval of model parameter distributions from scattering patterns. A user-friendly open-source Monte Carlo regression package (McSAS) is presented, which structures the analysis of small-angle scattering (SAS) using uncorrelated shape-similar particles (or scattering contributions). The underdetermined problem is solvable, provided that sufficient external information is available. Based on this, the user picks a scatterer contribution model (or 'shape') from a comprehensive library and defines variation intervals of its model parameters. A multitude of scattering contribution models are included, including prolate and oblate nanoparticles, core-shell objects, several polymer models, and a model for densely packed spheres. Most importantly,\nincluded, including prolate and oblate nanoparticles, core-shell objects, several polymer models, and a model for densely packed spheres. Most importantly, the form-free Monte Carlo nature of McSAS means it is not necessary to provide further restrictions on the mathematical form of the parameter distribution; without prior knowledge, McSAS is able to extract complex multimodal or odd-shaped parameter distributions from SAS data. When provided with data on an absolute scale with reasonable uncertainty estimates, the software outputs model parameter distributions in absolute volume fraction, and provides the modes of the distribution (e.g. mean, variance etc.). In addition to facilitating the evaluation of (series of) SAS curves, McSAS also helps in assessing the significance of the results through the addition of uncertainty estimates to the result. The McSAS software can be integrated as part of an automated reduction and analysis procedure in laboratory instruments or at synchrotron beamlines. Crystal structure of Salmonella\nsimilarities in their functional mechanisms. In the triclinic P1 cell, StPrpC molecules were organized as decamers composed of five identical dimer units. In solution, StPrpC was in a dimeric form at low concentrations and was converted to larger oligomers at higher concentrations. CSs are usually dimeric proteins. In Gram-negative bacteria, a hexameric form, believed to be important for regulation of activity by NADH, is also observed. Structural comparisons with hexameric E. coli CS suggested that the key residues involved in NADH binding are not conserved in StPrpC. Structural comparison with the ligand free and bound states of CSs showed that StPrpC is in a nearly closed conformation despite the absence of bound ligands. It was found that the Tyr197 and Leu324 of StPrpC are structurally equivalent to the ligand binding residues His and Val, respectively, of CSs. These substitutions might determine the specificities for acyl-CoAs of these enzymes.",

Although, as shown here, these three proteins are not required for the formation of enzymatically active ATP synthase, Su e/Tim11 and Su g are essential for the formation of the dimeric state. Su e/Tim11 appears to play a central role in this dimerization process. The dimer-specific subunits are associated with the membrane bound F0-sector. The F0-sector may thereby be involved in the dimerization of two monomeric F1F0-ATP synthase complexes. We speculate that the F1F0-ATP synthase of yeast, like the other complexes of oxidative phosphorylation, form supracomplexes to optimize transduction of energy and to enhance the stability of the complex in the membrane.

Using the technique of blue native gel electrophoresis, the oligomeric state of the yeast mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase was analysed. Solubilization of mitochondrial membranes with low detergent to protein ratios led to the identification of the dimeric state of the ATP synthase. Analysis of the subunit composition of the dimer, in comparison with the monomer, revealed the presence of three additional small proteins.

The dimers are linked together back-to-face by DAPIT (diabetes-associated protein in insulin-sensitive tissue; yeast subunit k), forming long oligomers along the edges of the cristae. TMEM70 facilitates biogenesis of mammalian ATP synthase by promoting subunit c incorporation into the rotor structure of the enzyme. Biogenesis of F1Fo ATP synthase, the key enzyme of mitochondrial energy provision, depends on transmembrane protein 70 (TMEM70), localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane of higher eukaryotes. TMEM70 absence causes severe ATP-synthase deficiency and leads to a neonatal mitochondrial encephalocardiomyopathy in humans. However, the exact biochemical function of TMEM70 remains unknown. Using TMEM70 conditional knockout in mice, we show that absence of TMEM70 impairs the early stage of enzyme biogenesis by preventing incorporation of hydrophobic subunit c into rotor structure of the enzyme. This results in the formation of an\nmitochondrial network and the disorganization of mitochondrial ultrastructure. Unlike what was shown in yeast, the impairment of the ATP synthase oligomerization process drastically affects mitochondrial ATP production. Thus we propose that mutations or deletions of genes encoding subunits e and g may have physiopathological implications. The yeast F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase: analysis of the molecular organization of subunit g and the importance of a conserved GXXXG motif. The F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase enzyme is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it forms dimeric complexes. Dimerization of the ATP synthase involves the physical association of the neighboring membrane-embedded F(0)-sectors. In yeast, the F(0)-sector subunits g and e (Su g and Su e, respectively) play a key role in supporting the formation of ATP synthase dimers. In this study we have focused on Su g to gain a better understanding of the function and the molecular organization of this subunit within the ATP synthase complex.\nconductance of the F-ATP synthase channel about tenfold. Ablation of the first TM of subunit b, which creates a distinct lateral domain with e and g, further affected channel activity.CONCLUSION: F-ATP synthase e, g and b subunits create a domain within the membrane that is critical for the generation of the high-conductance channel, thus is a prime candidate for PTP formation. Subunits e and g are only present in eukaryotes and may have evolved to confer this novel function to F-ATP synthase. Functional analysis of subunit e of the F1Fo-ATP synthase of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: importance of the N-terminal membrane anchor region. Mitochondrial F1Fo-ATP synthase complexes do not exist as physically independent entities but rather form dimeric and possibly oligomeric complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Stable dimerization of two F1Fo-monomeric complexes involves the physical association of two membrane-embedded Fo-sectors. Previously, formation of the ATP synthase dimeric-oligomeric network was\nyeast mutant. Mitochondria were isolated from the resulting transformant strains, and a number of functions of Su e were analyzed. Our results indicate that the N-terminal hydrophobic region plays important roles in the Su e-dependent processes of mitochondrial DNA maintenance, modulation of mitochondrial morphology, and stabilization of the dimer-specific Fo subunits, subunits g and k. Furthermore, we show that the C-terminal coiled-coil region of Su e functions to stabilize the dimeric form of detergent-solubilized ATP synthase complexes. Finally, we propose a model to explain how Su e supports the assembly of the ATP synthase dimers-oligomers in the mitochondrial membrane. Stepwise assembly of dimeric F(1)F(o)-ATP synthase in mitochondria involves the small F(o)-subunits k and i. F(1)F(o)-ATP synthase is a key enzyme of oxidative phosphorylation that is localized in the inner membrane of mitochondria. It uses the energy stored in the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane to catalyze the synthesis\nmammalian mitochondrial ATP synthase determined by cryo-EM. Mitochondrial ATP synthase is responsible for the synthesis of ATP, a universal energy currency in cells. Whereas X-ray crystallography has revealed the structure of the soluble region of the complex and the membrane-intrinsic c-subunits, little is known about the structure of the six other proteins (a, b, f, A6L, e, and g) that comprise the membrane-bound region of the complex in animal mitochondria. Here, we present the structure of intact bovine mitochondrial ATP synthase at \u223c18 \u00c5 resolution by electron cryomicroscopy of single particles in amorphous ice. The map reveals that the a-subunit and c(8)-ring of the complex interact with a small contact area and that the b-subunit spans the membrane without contacting the c(8)-ring. The e- and g-subunits extend from the a-subunit density distal to the c(8)-ring. The map was calculated from images of a preparation of the enzyme solubilized with the\nof mitochondria. It uses the energy stored in the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane to catalyze the synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate. Dimeric and higher oligomeric forms of ATP synthase have been observed in mitochondria from various organisms. Oligomerization of ATP synthase is critical for the morphology of the inner mitochondrial membrane because it supports the generation of tubular cristae membrane domains. Association of individual F(1)F(o)-ATP synthase complexes is mediated by the membrane-embedded F(o)-part. Several subunits were mapped to monomer-monomer-interfaces of yeast ATP synthase complexes, but only Su e (Atp21) and Su g (Atp20) have so far been identified as crucial for the formation of stable dimers. We show that two other small F(o)-components, Su k (Atp19) and Su i (Atp18) are involved in the stepwise assembly of F(1)F(o)-ATP synthase dimers and oligomers. We have identified an intermediate form of the ATP synthase dimer, which accumulates\nmodulator of permeability transition pore in yeast. The mitochondrial ATP synthase, an enzyme that synthesizes ATP and is involved in the formation of the mitochondrial mega-channel and permeability transition, is a multi-subunit complex. In S. cerevisiae, the uncharacterized protein Mco10 was previously found to be associated with ATP synthase and referred as a new 'subunit l'. However, recent cryo-EM structures could not ascertain Mco10 with the enzyme making questionable its role as a structural subunit. The N-terminal part of Mco10 is very similar to k/Atp19 subunit, which along with subunits g/Atp20 and e/Atp21 plays a major role in stabilization of the ATP synthase dimers. In our effort to confidently define the small protein interactome of ATP synthase we found Mco10. We herein investigate the impact of Mco10 on ATP synthase functioning. Biochemical analysis reveal in spite of similarity in sequence and evolutionary lineage, that Mco10 and Atp19 differ significantly in\ndensity distal to the c(8)-ring. The map was calculated from images of a preparation of the enzyme solubilized with the detergent dodecyl maltoside, which is visible in electron cryomicroscopy maps. The structure shows that the micelle surrounding the complex is curved. The observed bend in the micelle of the detergent-solubilized complex is consistent with previous electron tomography experiments and suggests that monomers of ATP synthase are sufficient to produce curvature in lipid bilayers. Mitochondrial F1Fo-ATP synthase: the small subunits e and g associate with monomeric complexes to trigger dimerization. Mitochondrial F(1)F(o)-ATP synthase catalyzes the formation of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. The enzyme is found in monomeric, dimeric and higher oligomeric forms in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Dimerization of ATP synthase complexes is a prerequisite for the generation of larger oligomers that promote membrane bending and formation of tubular cristae membranes. Two small proteins of the membrane-embedded F(o)-domain, subunit\nlarger oligomers that promote membrane bending and formation of tubular cristae membranes. Two small proteins of the membrane-embedded F(o)-domain, subunit e (Su e; Atp21) and Su g (Atp20), were identified as dimer-specific subunits of yeast ATP synthase and shown to be required for stabilization of the dimers. We have identified two distinct monomeric forms of yeast ATP synthase. Su e and Su g are present not only in the dimer but also in one of the monomeric forms. We demonstrate that Su e and Su g sequentially assemble with monomeric ATP synthase to form a dimerization-competent primed monomer. We conclude that association of Su e and Su g with monomeric F(1)F(o)-ATP synthase represents an initial step of oligomer formation. ATP synthase interactome analysis identifies a new subunit l as a modulator of permeability transition pore in yeast. The mitochondrial ATP synthase, an enzyme that synthesizes ATP and is involved in\nHigh-Conductance Channel Formation in Yeast Mitochondria is Mediated by F-ATP Synthase e and g Subunits. BACKGROUND/AIMS: The permeability transition pore (PTP) is an unselective, Ca2+-dependent high conductance channel of the inner mitochondrial membrane whose molecular identity has long remained a mystery. The most recent hypothesis is that pore formation involves the F-ATP synthase, which consistently generates Ca2+-activated channels. Available structures do not display obvious features that can accommodate a channel; thus, how the pore can form and whether its activity can be entirely assigned to F-ATP synthase is the matter of debate. In this study, we investigated the role of F-ATP synthase subunits e, g and b in PTP formation.METHODS: Yeast null mutants for e, g and the first transmembrane (TM) \u03b1-helix of subunit b were generated and evaluated for mitochondrial morphology (electron microscopy), membrane potential (Rhodamine123 fluorescence) and respiration (Clark electrode). Homoplasmic C23S mutant of subunit a was generated\npass through the membrane to drive ATP production. Mitochondrial ATP synthases form V-shaped homodimers in cristae membranes. Here we report the structure of a native and active mitochondrial ATP synthase dimer, determined by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy at 6.2 \u00c5 resolution. Our structure shows four long, horizontal membrane-intrinsic \u03b1-helices in the a-subunit, arranged in two hairpins at an angle of approximately 70\u00b0 relative to the c-ring helices. It has been proposed that a strictly conserved membrane-embedded arginine in the a-subunit couples proton translocation to c-ring rotation. A fit of the conserved carboxy-terminal a-subunit sequence places the conserved arginine next to a proton-binding c-subunit glutamate. The map shows a slanting solvent-accessible channel that extends from the mitochondrial matrix to the conserved arginine. Another hydrophilic cavity on the lumenal membrane surface defines a direct route for the protons to an essential histidine-glutamate pair. Our results provide unique new insights into the structure and\nis the c8-ring, which provides the membrane sector of the enzyme\u2019s rotor, and its assembly is influenced by another transmembrane (TMEM) protein, TMEM70. We have shown that subunit c interacts with TMEM70 and another hitherto unidentified mitochondrial transmembrane protein, TMEM242. Deletion of TMEM242, similar to deletion of TMEM70, affects but does not completely eliminate the assembly of ATP synthase, and to a lesser degree the assembly of respiratory enzyme complexes I, III, and IV. Deletion of TMEM70 and TMEM242 together prevents assembly of ATP synthase and the impact on complex I is enhanced. Removal of TMEM242, but not of TMEM70, also affects the introduction of subunits ATP6, ATP8, j, and k into the enzyme. TMEM70 and TMEM242 interact with the mitochondrial complex I assembly (the MCIA) complex that supports assembly of the membrane arm of complex I. The interactions of TMEM70 and TMEM242 with MCIA could be part of either\nfunctioning. Biochemical analysis reveal in spite of similarity in sequence and evolutionary lineage, that Mco10 and Atp19 differ significantly in function. The Mco10 is an auxiliary ATP synthase subunit that only functions in permeability transition. Horizontal membrane-intrinsic \u03b1-helices in the stator a-subunit of an F-type ATP synthase. ATP, the universal energy currency of cells, is produced by F-type ATP synthases, which are ancient, membrane-bound nanomachines. F-type ATP synthases use the energy of a transmembrane electrochemical gradient to generate ATP by rotary catalysis. Protons moving across the membrane drive a rotor ring composed of 8-15 c-subunits. A central stalk transmits the rotation of the c-ring to the catalytic F1 head, where a series of conformational changes results in ATP synthesis. A key unresolved question in this fundamental process is how protons pass through the membrane to drive ATP production. Mitochondrial ATP synthases form V-shaped homodimers in cristae membranes. Here we report\nmitochondrial morphology (electron microscopy), membrane potential (Rhodamine123 fluorescence) and respiration (Clark electrode). Homoplasmic C23S mutant of subunit a was generated by in vitro mutagenesis followed by biolistic transformation. F-ATP synthase assembly was evaluated by BN-PAGE analysis. Cu2+ treatment was used to induce the formation of F-ATP synthase dimers in the absence of e and g subunits. The electrophysiological properties of F-ATP synthase were assessed in planar lipid bilayers.RESULTS: Null mutants for the subunits e and g display dimer formation upon Cu2+ treatment and show PTP-dependent mitochondrial Ca2+ release but not swelling. Cu2+ treatment causes formation of disulfide bridges between Cys23 of subunits a that stabilize dimers in absence of e and g subunits and favors the open state of wild-type F-ATP synthase channels. Absence of e and g subunits decreases conductance of the F-ATP synthase channel about tenfold.

Subunits c and g, each with tandem C-terminal Strep II and FLAG tags, and known as c-t and g-t, respectively, were incorporated into ATP synthase in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). Subunit g is a component of the protein \u201cwedge\u201d in the membrane domain of the ATP synthase, but it does not interact directly with the c8-ring (Fig. 1). Therefore, in order to investigate which protein factors might be associated with the c-subunit during its assembly into c8-rings, subunit c-t was introduced into HEK293-\u0394\u03b4 cells, where the gene for the \u03b4-subunit of the ATP synthase had been disrupted. These cells are incapable of assembling the F1-domain of ATP synthase, but retain the ability to assemble c8-rings and accumulate oligomeric forms of the c-subunit (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B).

Mitochondrial morphogenesis is a key process of cell physiology. It is essential for the proper function of this double membrane-delimited organelle, as it ensures the packing of the inner membrane in a very ordered pattern called cristae. In yeast, the mitochondrial ATP synthase is able to form dimers that can assemble into oligomers. Two subunits (e and g) are involved in this supramolecular organization. Deletion of the genes encoding these subunits has no effect on the ATP synthase monomer assembly or activity and only affects its dimerization and oligomerization. Concomitantly, the absence of subunits e and g and thus, of ATP synthase supercomplexes, promotes the modification of mitochondrial ultrastructure suggesting that ATP synthase oligomerization is\nof mammalian ATP synthase Restoration of complex V deficiency caused by a novel deletion in the human TMEM70 gene normalizes mitochondrial morphology Common and novel TMEM70 mutations in a cohort of Italian patients with mitochondrial encephalocardiomyopathy TMEM70 functions in the assembly of complexes I and V Structure of the dimeric ATP synthase from bovine mitochondria Complexome profiling identifies TMEM126B as a component of the mitochondrial complex I assembly complex TMEM70 mutations cause isolated ATP synthase deficiency and neonatal mitochondrial encephalocardiomyopathy Nuclear genetic defects of mitochondrial ATP synthase Mitochondrial membrane assembly of TMEM70 protein TMEM70 forms oligomeric scaffolds within mitochondrial cristae promoting in situ assembly of mammalian ATP synthase proton channel Permeability transition in human mitochondria persists in the absence of peripheral stalk subunits of ATP synthase Persistence of the permeability transition pore in human mitochondria devoid of an assembled ATP synthase Building a complex complex: Assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain",

A forward genetic screen identifies chaperone CNX-1 as a conserved biogenesis regulator of ERG K+ channels The mechanism underlying the biogenesis of hERG channels is not fully understood. Bai et al. identify CNX-1 as a novel regulator of ERG K+ channel biogenesis that is conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans. The human ether-a-go-go\u2013related gene (hERG) encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel that controls repolarization of cardiac action potentials.

Introduction The ether \u00e0 go-go potassium channel family (KCNH)2 of voltage-gated potassium channels consists of three subgroups, ether \u00e0 go-go (EAG), EAG-related gene (ERG), and EAG-like potassium (ELK) channels. In recent years, most of the focus has been on the ERG subfamily because of their crucial role in cardiac repolarization. Relatively less is known about the physiological role of EAG channels. In Drosophila, where EAG channels were first discovered, the behavioral mutant (eag) causes spontaneous repetitive action potential (AP) firing in motor neurons and increased transmitter release that results in flight muscle paralysis. In mammals, EAG channel expression is normally restricted to the central nervous system, particularly the hippocampus, cerebellum, and brain stem. Recently, a role for EAG channels in regulating presynaptic calcium and neurotransmitter release during high frequency trains of APs has\ncell volume dynamics Elevation of intracellular calcium by muscarinic receptor activation induces a block of voltage-activated rat ether-a-go-go channels in a stably transfected cell line Characterization of an eag-like potassium channel in human neuroblastoma cells Inhibition of human ether a go-go potassium channels by Ca2+/calmodulin Inhibition of human ether a go-go potassium channels by Ca2+/calmodulin binding to the cytosolic N- and C-termini The roles of K+ channels in cancer Mammalian Per-Arnt-Sim proteins in environmental adaptation HERG potassium channel regulation by the N-terminal eag domain Mechanistic insight into human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) K+ channel deactivation gating from the solution structure of the EAG domain The N-terminal tail of hERG contains an amphipathic alpha-helix that regulates channel deactivation NMR solution structure of the N-terminal domain of hERG and its interaction with the S4-S5 linker Crystal structure and functional analysis of the HERG potassium channel N terminus: a eukaryotic PAS domain Amino terminal-dependent\ntemperature Calmodulin Regulates Human Ether \u00e0 Go-Go 1 (hEAG1) Potassium Channels through Interactions of the Eag Domain with the Cyclic Nucleotide Binding Homology Domain* The ether \u00e0 go-go family of voltage-gated potassium channels is structurally distinct. The N terminus contains an eag domain (eagD) that contains a Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain that is preceded by a conserved sequence of 25\u201327 amino acids known as the PAS-cap. The C terminus contains a region with homology to cyclic nucleotide binding domains (cNBHD), which is directly linked to the channel pore. The human EAG1 (hEAG1) channel is remarkably sensitive to inhibition by intracellular calcium (Ca2+i) through binding of Ca2+-calmodulin to three sites adjacent to the eagD and cNBHD. Here, we show that the eagD and cNBHD interact to modulate Ca2+-calmodulin as well as voltage-dependent gating. Sustained elevation of Ca2+i resulted in an initial profound inhibition of hEAG1 currents, which was followed by a phase\nEAG, ether-\u00e0-go-go related (ERG) and ether-\u00e0-go-go like (ELK). The human ether-\u00e0-go-go related gene (hERG) K(+) channel has been of significant interest because loss of function in the hERG channel is associated with a markedly increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias. The hERG channel has unusual kinetics with slow activation and deactivation but very rapid and voltage-dependent inactivation. The outer pore region of the hERG K(+) channel is predicted to be different from that of other members of the voltage-gated K(+) channel family. HERG has a much longer linker between the fifth transmembrane domain (SS) and the pore helix (S5P linker) compared to other families of voltage-gated K(+) channels (43 amino acids compared to 14-23 amino acids). Further, the S5P linker contains an amphipathic alpha-helix that in hERG channels probably interacts with the mouth of the pore to modulate inactivation. The human EAG and rat ELK2 channels (hEAG and rELK2) show reduced\nmainly affected channel deactivation. Our results suggest that EAG channels function via a conserved ligand/receptor model of voltage gating, but that the N-Cap and PAS domains have different roles in these channels. The structural mechanism of KCNH-channel regulation by the eag domain. The KCNH voltage-dependent potassium channels (ether-\u00e0-go-go, EAG; EAG-related gene, ERG; EAG-like channels, ELK) are important regulators of cellular excitability and have key roles in diseases such as cardiac long QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2), epilepsy, schizophrenia and cancer. The intracellular domains of KCNH channels are structurally distinct from other voltage-gated channels. The amino-terminal region contains an eag domain, which is composed of a Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain and a PAS-cap domain, whereas the carboxy-terminal region contains a cyclic nucleotide-binding homology domain (CNBHD), which is connected to the pore through a C-linker domain. Many disease-causing mutations localize to these specialized intracellular domains, which underlie the unique gating and regulation of\nWe consider here the latest advances on these issues provided by the elucidation of eag1 and erg1 three-dimensional structures, and by both classical and more recent functional studies with different members of the EAG subfamily. Voltage-dependent activation in EAG channels follows a ligand-receptor rather than a mechanical-lever mechanism. Ether-a-go-go family (EAG) channels play a major role in many physiological processes in humans, including cardiac repolarization and cell proliferation. Cryo-EM structures of two of them, KV10.1 and human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG or KV11.1), have revealed an original nondomain-swapped structure, suggesting that the mechanism of voltage-dependent gating of these two channels is quite different from the classical mechanical-lever model. Molecular aspects of hERG voltage-gating have been extensively studied, indicating that the S4-S5 linker (S4-S5L) acts as a ligand binding to the S6 gate (S6 C-terminal part, S6T) and stabilizes it in a closed state. Moreover, the N-terminal extremity of the channel, called\nthe inhibition of protein translation and synthesis, in turn inhibiting the expression of KCNH2. These results provided a theoretical basis for clinical treatment of Long QT syndrome. The subfamily-specific assembly of Eag and Erg K+ channels is determined by both the amino and the carboxyl recognition domains. A functional voltage-gated K(+) (Kv) channel comprises four pore-forming \u03b1-subunits, and only members of the same Kv channel subfamily may co-assemble to form heterotetramers. The ether-\u00e0-go-go family of Kv channels (KCNH) encompasses three distinct subfamilies: Eag (Kv10), Erg (Kv11), and Elk (Kv12). Members of different ether-\u00e0-go-go subfamilies, such as Eag and Erg, fail to form heterotetramers. Although a short stretch of amino acid sequences in the distal C-terminal section has been implicated in subfamily-specific subunit assembly, it remains unclear whether this region serves as the sole and/or principal subfamily recognition domain for Eag and Erg. Here we aim to ascertain the structural basis\nComputational Models for Understanding of Structure, Function and Pharmacology of the Cardiac Potassium Channel Kv11.1 (hERG). The rapid delayed rectifier current IKr is one of the major K+ currents involved in repolarization of the human cardiac action potential. Various inherited or drug-induced forms of the long QT syndrome (LQTS) in humans are linked to functional and structural modifications in the IKr conducting channels. IKr is carried by the potassium channel Kv11.1 encoded by the gene KCNH2 (commonly referred to as human ether-a-go-go-related gene or hERG) [1, 2]. The first necessary step for predicting emergent drug effects on the heart is determining and modeling the binding thermodynamics and kinetics of primary and major off-target drug interactions with subcellular targets. The bulk of drugs that target hERG channels are known to have complex interactions at the atomic scale. Accordingly, one of the goals for this review is to provide comprehensive guide in\nprotein is in the plasma membrane, and 3) new insight into the rate of biogenesis of KCNH2 channel protein within cells. Individual subunits contribute independently to slow gating of bovine EAG potassium channels. The bovine ether \u00e0 go-go gene encodes a delayed rectifier potassium channel. In contrast to other delayed rectifiers, its activation kinetics is largely determined by the holding potential and the concentration of extracellular Mg2+, giving rise to slowly activating currents with a characteristic sigmoidal rising phase. Replacement of a single amino acid in the extracellular linker between transmembrane segments S3 and S4 (L322H) strongly reduced the prepulse dependence and accelerated activation by 1 order of magnitude. In addition, compared with the wild type, the half-activation voltage of this mutant was shifted by more than 30 mV to more negative potentials. We used dimeric and tetrameric constructs of the bovine eag1 gene to analyze channels with defined stoichiometry\nwith the notion that both the N-terminal and the C-terminal recognition domains are required to sustain the subfamily-specific assembly of rat Eag1 and human Erg. Kcnh2 deletion is associated with rat embryonic development defects via destruction of KCNH2\u2011integrin \u03b21 complex. The Kv11.1 potassium channel encoded by the Kcnh2 gene is crucial in conducting the rapid delayed rectifier K+ current in cardiomyocytes. Homozygous mutation in Kcnh2 is embryonically lethal in humans and mice. However, the molecular signaling pathway of intrauterine fetal loss is unclear. The present study generated a Kcnh2 knockout rat based on edited rat embryonic stem cells (rESCs). Kcnh2 knockout was embryonic lethal on day 11.5 of development due to a heart configuration defect. Experiments with human embryonic heart single cells (6.5\u20117 weeks post\u2011conception) suggested that potassium voltage\u2011gated channel subfamily H member 2 (KCNH2) plays a crucial role in the development of compact cardiomyocytes. By contrast, apoptosis was found\nbiogenesis of UNC-103. Importantly, Calnexin interacted with hERG proteins in the ER in HEK293T cells. Deletion of calnexin reduced the expression and current densities of endogenous hERG K+ channels in SH-SY5Y cells. Collectively, we reveal an evolutionarily conserved chaperone CNX-1/Calnexin controlling the biogenesis of ERG-type K+ channels. Introduction The human ether-a-go-go\u2013related gene (hERG) channel is a delayed rectifier voltage-gated K+ channel that controls repolarization of action potentials in cardiomyocytes. Dysfunction of hERG is associated with multiple human diseases, including long QT syndrome (LQTS), schizophrenia, epilepsy, and multiple types of cancers. Although most LQTS-related hERG mutations result in decreased surface expression of the channel, the molecular mechanism underlying maturation of hERG K+ channel is not fully understood. The sole Caenorhabditis elegans ERG-type K+ channel, UNC-103, is homologous to hERG, with 70% amino acid identity in functionally important transmembrane domains and cyclic nucleotide\u2013binding domain.

The EAG Voltage-Dependent K+ Channel Subfamily: Similarities and Differences in Structural Organization and Gating. EAG (ether-\u00e0-go-go or KCNH) are a subfamily of the voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels. Like for all potassium channels, opening of EAG channels drives the membrane potential toward its equilibrium value for potassium, thus setting the resting potential and repolarizing action potentials. As voltage-dependent channels, they switch between open and closed conformations (gating) when changes in membrane potential are sensed by a voltage sensing domain (VSD) which is functionally coupled to a pore domain\nChaperone Proteins Reciprocal control of hERG stability by Hsp70 and Hsc70 with implication for restoration of LQT2 mutant stability Transmembrane segments prevent surface expression of sodium channel Nav1.8 and promote calnexin-dependent channel degradation N-glycan-mediated quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum is required for the expression of correctly folded \u03b4-opioid receptors at the cell surface Characterization of an eag-like potassium channel in human neuroblastoma cells Calnexin improves the folding efficiency of mutant rhodopsin in the presence of pharmacological chaperone 11-cis-retinal The roles of K(+) channels in cancer In vivo identification of genes that modify ether-a-go-go-related gene activity in Caenorhabditis elegans may also affect human cardiac arrhythmia Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Behavioral genetics of caenorhabditis elegans unc-103-encoded erg-like K(+) channel A mechanistic link between an inherited and an acquired cardiac arrhythmia: HERG encodes the IKr potassium channel The Structure of calnexin, an ER chaperone involved in quality control of protein\nof KCNH2. KCNH2 also coimmunoprecipitated with KCNQ1-WT. Although KCNQ1-T587M coprecipitated with KCNH2, the mutant was retained intracellularly and failed to increase KCNH2 membrane localization, abolishing the KCNQ1-WT chaperone function and reducing I(KCNH2) upon coexpression substantially compared with coexpression with KCNQ1-WT (P <.05). In vivo transfection of KCNQ1-T587M in guinea pigs suppressed I(Kr) in isolated cardiomyocytes.CONCLUSION: The trafficking-deficient LQTS mutation KCNQ1-T587M fails to show the chaperoning function that enhances KCNH2 membrane localization with KCNQ1-WT. This novel mechanism results in reduced I(KCNH2), which would be expected to decrease repolarization reserve and synergize with reduced I(KCNQ1) caused directly by the mutation, potentially explaining the malignant clinical phenotype in affected patients.

Resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase (Ric-8)A and Ric-8B are essential genes that encode positive regulators of heterotrimeric G protein \u03b1 subunits. Controversy persists surrounding the precise way(s) that Ric-8 proteins affect G protein biology and signaling. Ric-8 proteins chaperone nucleotide-free G\u03b1-subunit states during biosynthetic protein folding prior to G protein heterotrimer assembly. In organisms spanning the evolutionary window of Ric-8 expression, experimental perturbation of Ric-8 genes results in reduced functional abundances of G proteins because G protein \u03b1 subunits are misfolded and degraded rapidly. Ric-8 proteins also act as G\u03b1-subunit guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) in vitro. However, Ric-8 GEF activity could strictly be an in vitro phenomenon stemming from the ability of Ric-8 to induce partial G\u03b1 unfolding, thereby enhancing GDP release. Ric-8 GEF activity clearly differs from the GEF activity of G protein-coupled\ninduce partial G\u03b1 unfolding, thereby enhancing GDP release. Ric-8 GEF activity clearly differs from the GEF activity of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). G protein \u03b2\u03b3 is inhibitory to Ric-8 action but obligate for receptors. It remains an open question whether Ric-8 has dual functions in cells and regulates G proteins as both a molecular chaperone and GEF. Clearly, Ric-8 has a profound influence on heterotrimeric G protein function. For this reason, we propose that Ric-8 proteins are as yet untested therapeutic targets in which pharmacological inhibition of the Ric-8/G\u03b1 protein-protein interface could serve to attenuate the effects of disease-causing G proteins (constitutively active mutants) and/or GPCR signaling. This minireview will chronicle the understanding of Ric-8 function, provide a comparative discussion of the Ric-8 molecular chaperoning and GEF activities, and support the case for why Ric-8 proteins should be considered potential targets for development of new therapies. A Ric8/synembryn homolog promotes\nfactor. ric-8 (resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase 8) genes have positive roles in variegated G protein signaling pathways, including G\u03b1(q) and G\u03b1(s) regulation of neurotransmission, G\u03b1(i)-dependent mitotic spindle positioning during (asymmetric) cell division, and G\u03b1(olf)-dependent odorant receptor signaling. Mammalian Ric-8 activities are partitioned between two genes, ric-8A and ric-8B. Ric-8A is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for G\u03b1(i)/\u03b1(q)/\u03b1(12/13) subunits. Ric-8B potentiated G(s) signaling presumably as a G\u03b1(s)-class GEF activator, but no demonstration has shown Ric-8B GEF activity. Here, two Ric-8B isoforms were purified and found to be G\u03b1 subunit GDP release factor/GEFs. In HeLa cells, full-length Ric-8B (Ric-8BFL) bound endogenously expressed G\u03b1(s) and lesser amounts of G\u03b1(q) and G\u03b1(13). Ric-8BFL stimulated guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP\u03b3S) binding to these subunits and G\u03b1(olf), whereas the Ric-8B\u03949 isoform stimulated G\u03b1(s short) GTP\u03b3S binding only. Michaelis-Menten experiments showed that Ric-8BFL elevated the V(max) of G\u03b1(s) steady state GTP hydrolysis and the apparent K(m) values\nRic-8 proteins are molecular chaperones that direct nascent G protein \u03b1 subunit membrane association. Ric-8A (resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase 8A) and Ric-8B are guanine nucleotide exchange factors that enhance different heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) signaling pathways by unknown mechanisms. Because transgenic disruption of Ric-8A or Ric-8B in mice caused early embryonic lethality, we derived viable Ric-8A- or Ric-8B-deleted embryonic stem (ES) cell lines from blastocysts of these mice. We observed pleiotropic G protein signaling defects in Ric-8A(-/-) ES cells, which resulted from reduced steady-state amounts of G\u03b1(i), G\u03b1(q), and G\u03b1(13) proteins to <5% of those of wild-type cells. The amounts of G\u03b1(s) and total G\u03b2 protein were partially reduced in Ric-8A(-/-) cells compared to those in wild-type cells, and only the amount of G\u03b1(s) was reduced substantially in Ric-8B(-/-) cells. The abundances of mRNAs encoding the G protein \u03b1 subunits were largely unchanged by loss of Ric-8A\ncharacteristics associated with G protein signaling and contributes to our overall understanding of how G protein \u03b1 subunits function with or without a canonical G\u03b2 partner in C. neoformans. Structures of Ric-8B in complex with G\u03b1 protein folding clients reveal isoform specificity mechanisms. Mammalian Ric-8 proteins act as chaperones to regulate the cellular abundance of heterotrimeric G protein \u03b1 subunits. The Ric-8A isoform chaperones G\u03b1i/o, G\u03b112/13, and G\u03b1q/11 subunits, while Ric-8B acts on G\u03b1s/olf subunits. Here, we determined cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Ric-8B in complex with G\u03b1s and G\u03b1olf, revealing isoform differences in the relative positioning and contacts between the C-terminal \u03b15 helix of G\u03b1 within the concave pocket formed by Ric-8 \u03b1-helical repeat elements. Despite the overall architectural similarity with our earlier structures of Ric-8A complexed to G\u03b1q and G\u03b1i1, Ric-8B distinctly accommodates an extended loop found only in G\u03b1s/olf proteins. The structures, along with results from Ric-8\nand G\u03b1i1, Ric-8B distinctly accommodates an extended loop found only in G\u03b1s/olf proteins. The structures, along with results from Ric-8 protein thermal stability assays and cell-based G\u03b1olf folding assays, support a requirement for the G\u03b1 C-terminal region for binding specificity, and highlight that multiple structural elements impart specificity for Ric-8/G protein binding. Resistance to Inhibitors of Cholinesterase 3 (Ric-3) Expression Promotes Selective Protein Associations with the Human \u03b17-Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Interactome The \u03b17-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17-nAChR) is a ligand-gated ion channel widely expressed in vertebrates and is associated with numerous physiological functions. As transmembrane ion channels, \u03b17-nAChRs need to be expressed on the surface of the plasma membrane to function. The receptor has been reported to associate with proteins involved with receptor biogenesis, modulation of receptor properties, as well as intracellular signaling cascades and some of these associated proteins may affect surface expression of \u03b17-nAChRs. The putative chaperone resistance to\nin Ric-8B(-/-) cells. The abundances of mRNAs encoding the G protein \u03b1 subunits were largely unchanged by loss of Ric-8A or Ric-8B. The plasma membrane residence of G proteins persisted in the absence of Ric-8 but was markedly reduced compared to that in wild-type cells. Endogenous G\u03b1(i) and G\u03b1(q) were efficiently translated in Ric-8A(-/-) cells but integrated into endomembranes poorly; however, the reduced amounts of G protein \u03b1 subunits that reached the membrane still bound to nascent G\u03b2\u03b3. Finally, G\u03b1(i), G\u03b1(q), and G\u03b2(1) proteins exhibited accelerated rates of degradation in Ric-8A(-/-) cells compared to those in wild-type cells. Together, these data suggest that Ric-8 proteins are molecular chaperones required for the initial association of nascent G\u03b1 subunits with cellular membranes. Ric-8B is a GTP-dependent G protein alphas guanine nucleotide exchange factor. ric-8 (resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase 8) genes have positive roles in variegated G protein signaling pathways, including G\u03b1(q)\npotential pathways leading to the synaptic effects of light-dispersed G\u03b1t1 and G\u03b21\u03b31. Furthermore, we show that a prominent non-GPCR guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and a chaperone of G\u03b1 subunits, resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase 8A (Ric-8A) protein, is expressed throughout the retina including photoreceptor cells. Recent structures of Ric-8A alone and in complexes with G\u03b1 subunits have illuminated the structural underpinnings of the Ric-8A activities. We generated a mouse model with conditional knockout of Ric-8A in rods in order to begin defining the functional roles of the protein in rod photoreceptors and the retina. Our analysis suggests that Ric-8A is not an obligate chaperone of G\u03b1t1. Further research is needed to investigate probable roles of Ric-8A as a GEF, trafficking chaperone, or a mediator of the synaptic effects of G\u03b1t1. Biophysical studies support a predicted superhelical structure with armadillo repeats for Ric-8. Ric-8 is a highly conserved cytosolic protein\nand identifying the components of the signalling cascade downstream of these receptors, at the level of the G-protein the modulation of receptor signal transduction remains relatively unexplored. In this regard a taste-specific regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS), RGS21, has recently been identified. To study whether guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) are involved in the transduction of the signal downstream of the taste GPCRs we investigated the expression of Ric-8A and Ric-8B in mouse taste cells and their interaction with G-protein subunits found in taste buds. Mammalian Ric-8 proteins were initially identified as potent GEFs for a range of Galpha subunits and Ric-8B has recently been shown to amplify olfactory signal transduction. We find that both Ric-8A and Ric-8B are expressed in a large portion of taste bud cells and that most of these cells contain IP3R-3 a marker for sweet, umami and bitter taste receptor cells.

Michaelis-Menten experiments showed that Ric-8BFL elevated the V(max) of G\u03b1(s) steady state GTP hydrolysis and the apparent K(m) values of GTP binding to G\u03b1(s) from \u223c385 nm to an estimated value of \u223c42 \u03bcM. Directionality of the Ric-8BFL-catalyzed G\u03b1(s) exchange reaction was GTP-dependent. At sub-K(m) GTP, Ric-BFL was inhibitory to exchange despite being a rapid GDP release accelerator. Ric-8BFL binds nucleotide-free G\u03b1(s) tightly, and near-K(m) GTP levels were required to dissociate the Ric-8B\u00b7G\u03b1 nucleotide-free intermediate to release free Ric-8B and G\u03b1-GTP. Ric-8BFL-catalyzed nucleotide exchange probably proceeds in the forward direction to produce G\u03b1-GTP in cells. Ric-8A, a Galpha protein guanine nucleotide exchange factor potentiates taste receptor signaling. Taste receptors for sweet, bitter and umami tastants are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). While much effort has been devoted to understanding G-protein-receptor interactions and identifying the components of the signalling cascade downstream of these receptors, at the level of the G-protein the modulation\nkidney Identification and characterization of VPO1, a new animal heme-containing peroxidase Rapsyn-mediated clustering of acetylcholine receptor subunits requires the major cytoplasmic loop of the receptor subunits SLURP-2: A novel cholinergic signaling peptide in human mucocutaneous epithelium Three-finger snake neurotoxins and Ly6 proteins targeting nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: pharmacological tools and endogenous modulators The neuronal calcium sensor NCS-1 regulates the phosphorylation state and activity of the G\u03b1 chaperone and GEF Ric-8A. The neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS-1), an EF-hand Ca2+ binding protein, and Ric-8A coregulate synapse number and probability of neurotransmitter release. Recently, the structures of Ric-8A bound to G\u03b1 have revealed how Ric-8A phosphorylation promotes G\u03b1 recognition and activity as a chaperone and guanine nucleotide exchange factor. However, the molecular mechanism by which NCS-1 regulates Ric-8A activity and its interaction with G\u03b1 subunits is not well understood. Given the interest in the NCS-1/Ric-8A complex as a therapeutic target in nervous system\nglycosylation have been associated with nAChR assembly and trafficking. Associating proteins that are involved in the complex process of \u03b17-nAChR surface expression are of particular interest because alterations in nAChR expression can contribute to disease. Additionally, one of the limited number of proteins previously reported to associate with \u03b17-nAChRs, is the molecular chaperone resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase 3 (Ric-3), which has been shown to facilitate nAChR assembly and trafficking. Ric-3 is a chaperone that is predominantly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and has been shown to increase functional expression of homomeric \u03b17-nAChRs on the cell surface. Ric-3 also has been reported to enhance the expression of \u03b18-, \u03b19-, \u03b13\u03b24-, \u03b13\u03b22-, \u03b14\u03b22-, and \u03b14\u03b24-nAChRs in mammalian cells. The mechanisms by which Ric-3 enhances surface expression of \u03b17-nAChRs are not fully understood. One proposed mechanism is that Ric-3 promotes the assembly of nAChR subunits into complete oligomers to facilitate transportation\nDMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) containing 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 50 \u03bcg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies, Eugene, OR). SH-EP1-h\u03b17 cells were grown with an additional 80 mg/L hygromycin B (Invivogen, San Diego, CA) and SH-EP1-h\u03b17-Ric-3 cells with an additional 80 mg/L hygromycin B and 40 mg/L G418 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). The vector used to transfect both cell lines to express human \u03b17-nAChR confers hygromycin B resistance while the vector used to express Ric-3 in SH-EP1-h\u03b17-Ric-3 confers G418 resistance. Cultures were maintained in 75 cm2 flasks in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. Cells were processed to isolate solubilized membrane protein when cells were 90% confluent in flasks. Membrane protein solubilization Cells were washed with homogenization buffer (100 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.4) before being mechanically dislodged. Isolated cells were then homogenized with 30 strokes of a Potter-Elvehjem glass homogenizer on\nG\u03b1t1. Biophysical studies support a predicted superhelical structure with armadillo repeats for Ric-8. Ric-8 is a highly conserved cytosolic protein (MW 63 KDa) initially identified in C. elegans as an essential factor in neurotransmitter release and asymmetric cell division. Two different isoforms have been described in mammals, Ric-8A and Ric-8B; each possess guanine nucleotide exchange activity (GEF) on heterotrimeric G-proteins, but with different Galpha subunits specificities. To gain insight on the mechanisms involved in Ric-8 cellular functions it is essential to obtain some information about its structure. Therefore, the aim of this work was to create a structural model for Ric-8. In this case, it was not possible to construct a model based on comparison with a template structure because Ric-8 does not present sequence similarity with any other protein. Consequently, different bioinformatics approaches that include protein folding and structure prediction were used. The Ric-8 structural model is composed of\nin solubilized receptor preparations of SH-EP1-h\u03b17-Ric-3 and SH-EP1-h\u03b17 cells. Solubilized receptor preparations from SH-EP1-h\u03b17-Ric-3 cells contain Ric-3 immunoreactivity while no immunoreactivity was observed in preparations of SH-EP1-h\u03b17 cells (Fig 3).

We set the following a priori inclusion criteria parameters to identify proteins: 1% protein FDR, \u2265 90% group probability of correct identity assignment, and the presence in two or more of\nConsequently, different bioinformatics approaches that include protein folding and structure prediction were used. The Ric-8 structural model is composed of 10 armadillo folding motifs, organized in a right-twisted alpha-alpha super helix. In order to validate the structural model, a His-tag fusion construct of Ric-8 was expressed in E. coli, purified by affinity and anion exchange chromatography and subjected to circular dichroism analysis (CD) and thermostability studies. Ric-8 is approximately 80% alpha helix, with a Tm of 43.1 degrees C, consistent with an armadillo-type structure such as alpha-importin, a protein composed of 10 armadillo repeats. The proposed structural model for Ric-8 is intriguing because armadillo proteins are known to interact with multiple partners and participate in diverse cellular functions. These results open the possibility of finding new protein partners for Ric-8 with new cellular functions. The G protein \u03b1 chaperone Ric-8 as a potential therapeutic target. Resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase\n(S4 Table). The reported Ric-3-mediated interactome consists of proteins associated with the cytosol, intracellular membranes, and the ER. Many of the identified Ric-3-mediated proteins are reported to be localized in the ER, which agrees with previous reports that Ric-3 is a chaperone predominantly expressed in the ER. In comparison, none of the proteins identified as unique in SH-EP1-\u03b17 samples have been reported to be localized in the ER. Discussion To identify the Ric-3-mediated \u03b17-nAChR interactome, specific \u03b1-bgtx-binding proteins were isolated from cells stably expressing the receptor alone or the receptor and Ric-3 using \u03b1-bgtx affinity beads and specifically eluted using a cholinergic agonist. Eluted proteins were digested with trypsin and the resulting peptides were analyzed with mass spectrometry. Analysis of peptide fragmentation spectrum was used to identify the proteins that associated with \u03b17-nAChRs in samples isolated from cells expressing, or not expressing Ric-3. Identified in this study were thirty-nine proteins\ntimes with solubilization buffer and measured. Comparable 125I-\u03b1-bgtx binding activity of protein-\u03b1-bgtx-affinity bead complexes isolated from SH-EP1-h\u03b17-Ric-3 (56 \u00b1 15 fmol/mg, in blue) and SH-EP1-h\u03b17 (49 \u00b1 9 fmol/mg, in green) was observed (Student\u2019s t test, p = 0.40) while SH-EP1 preparations (in purple) did not show \u03b1-bgtx binding activity. No 125I-\u03b1-bgtx binding to protein-\u03b1-bgtx-affinity bead complexes was observed in samples treated with 5 \u03bcM MLA confirming \u03b17-nAChR specificity (Student t test, p < 0.05). SH-EP1-h\u03b17-Ric-3 and SH-EP1-h\u03b17 125I-bgtx binding activity was analyzed with five independent biological replicates. MLA treated samples and SH-EP1 125I-\u03b1-bgtx binding activity were analyzed with three independent biological replicates. Immunoblot confirmation of Ric-3 expression SH-EP1 cells have been shown previously to lack detectable protein levels of the chaperone Ric-3. Immunoblotting was used to probe Ric-3 immunoreactivity in solubilized receptor preparations of SH-EP1-h\u03b17-Ric-3 and SH-EP1-h\u03b17 cells. Solubilized receptor preparations from SH-EP1-h\u03b17-Ric-3 cells contain Ric-3 immunoreactivity while no\nmorphology as compared to the heterogeneity of the cell types found in of the murine brain. The work shown here investigates a more focused, Ric-3-mediated \u03b17-nAChR interactome, rather than a general \u03b17-nAChR interactome, which was the aim of the previous study. Ric-3-mediated \u03b17-nAChR associated proteins The role of the molecular chaperone Ric-3 in \u03b17-nAChR expression has been investigated by a number of different methods in multiple models and previous reports have demonstrated an increase in cell surface expression of \u03b17-nAChRs in cells also expressing Ric-3. Human cells lines were used to identify \u03b17-nAChR protein-associations that appear with co-expression of Ric-3. Of a total of thirty-nine identified members of the Ric-3-mediated \u03b17-nAChR interactome, fourteen proteins have been previously reported to be associated with a process known to affect protein expression. Of the remaining proteins, five are associated with signal transduction/intracellular signaling, seven with protein catabolism and/or autophagy, and fourteen that do",

Furthermore, we find that a secondary contact between Pol IV and \u03b2 limits Pol IV synthesis under normal conditions but facilitates Pol III displacement from the primer terminus following Pol IV induction during the SOS DNA damage response. These results support a role for secondary polymerase clamp interactions in regulating exchange and establishing a polymerase hierarchy. A Genetic Selection for dinB Mutants Reveals an Interaction between DNA Polymerase IV and the Replicative Polymerase That Is Required for Translesion Synthesis Translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) by specialized DNA polymerases (Pols) is a conserved mechanism for tolerating replication blocking DNA lesions. The actions of TLS Pols are managed in part by ring-shaped sliding clamp proteins. In addition to catalyzing TLS,\nsynthesis. As with another TLS polymerase, Pol IV, increasing concentrations of Pol II displace the Pol III core during DNA synthesis in a minimal reconstitution of primer extension. However, in contrast to Pol IV, Pol II is inefficient at disrupting rolling-circle synthesis by the fully reconstituted Pol III replisome. Together, these data suggest a \u03b2-mediated mechanism of exchange between Pol II and Pol III that occurs outside the replication fork. Residues in the fingers domain of the translesion DNA polymerase DinB enable its unique participation in error-prone double-strand break repair. The evolutionarily conserved Escherichia coli translesion DNA polymerase IV (DinB) is one of three enzymes that can bypass potentially deadly DNA lesions on the template strand during DNA replication. Remarkably, however, DinB is the only known translesion DNA polymerase active in RecA-mediated strand exchange during error-prone double-strand break repair. In this process, a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-RecA nucleoprotein filament invades homologous\nfunctional replisome resumes replication. This key role of Pol I in TLS uncovers a new function of the A-family DNA polymerases. Exchange between Escherichia coli polymerases II and III on a processivity clamp. Escherichia coli has three DNA polymerases implicated in the bypass of DNA damage, a process called translesion synthesis (TLS) that alleviates replication stalling. Although these polymerases are specialized for different DNA lesions, it is unclear if they interact differently with the replication machinery. Of the three, DNA polymerase (Pol) II remains the most enigmatic. Here we report a stable ternary complex of Pol II, the replicative polymerase Pol III core complex and the dimeric processivity clamp, \u03b2. Single-molecule experiments reveal that the interactions of Pol II and Pol III with \u03b2 allow for rapid exchange during DNA synthesis. As with another TLS polymerase, Pol IV, increasing concentrations of Pol II displace the Pol III core during DNA\nmechanism for regulating TLS in vivo by managing access of Pol IV to the DNA. Author Summary Bacterial DNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) is capable of replicating damaged DNA via a process termed translesion DNA synthesis (TLS). Pol IV-mediated TLS can be accurate or error-prone, depending on the type of DNA damage. Errors made by Pol IV contribute to antibiotic resistance and adaptation of bacterial pathogens. In addition to catalyzing TLS, overproduction of Escherichia coli Pol IV impedes growth. In the current work, we demonstrate that both of these functions rely on the ability of Pol IV to bind the \u03b2 sliding processivity clamp and switch places on DNA with the replicative Pol, Pol III. This switch requires that Pol IV contact both Pol III as well as two discrete sites on the \u03b2 clamp protein. Taken together, these results provide a deeper understanding of how E. coli manages the\nPol IV appears to be governed by mass action, efficient recruitment of Pol V involves a chaperone-like action of the RecA filament. We present a model of Pol V activation: the 3' tip of the RecA filament initially stabilizes Pol V to allow stable complex formation with a sliding \u03b2-clamp, followed by the capture of the terminal RecA monomer by Pol V, thus forming a functional Pol V complex. This activation process likely determines higher accessibility of Pol V than of Pol IV to normal DNA. Finally, we discuss the biological significance of TLS polymerases during gap-filling reactions: error-prone gap-filling synthesis may contribute as a driving force for genetic diversity, adaptive mutation, and evolution.

A circle surrounding the replication fork represents the TLS-competent SSB-Ct cluster, where Pol IV and possibly other SIPs, are enriched upon replication stalling at a leading strand lesion. DNA polymerase I acts in translesion synthesis mediated by the Y-polymerases in Bacillus subtilis. Translesion synthesis (TLS) across damaged DNA bases is most often carried out by the ubiquitous error-prone DNA polymerases of the Y-family. Bacillus subtilis encodes two Y-polymerases, Pol Y1 and Pol Y2, that mediate TLS resulting in spontaneous and ultraviolet light (UV)-induced mutagenesis respectively.

In addition to DNA replication, DNA polymerases also participate in various genome maintenance activities including translesion synthesis (TLS). However, due to the error-prone nature of TLS polymerases, their association with clamps must be tightly regulated. Here we show that fork-associated ssDNA binding protein (SSB) selectively enriches the bacterial TLS polymerase Pol IV at stalled replication forks. This enrichment enables Pol IV to associate with the processivity clamp and is required for TLS on both the leading and lagging strands. In contrast, clamp-interacting proteins (CLIPs) lacking SSB binding are spatially segregated from the replication fork, minimally interfering with Pol IV-mediated TLS. We propose that stalling-dependent structural changes within clusters of fork-associated SSB establish hierarchical access to the processivity clamp.

These findings support a model in which reduced trimer stability causes these mutant PCNA proteins to occasionally undergo conformational changes that compromise their ability to stimulate TLS by both replicative and translesion polymerases. Thumb-domain dynamics modulate the functional repertoire of DNA-Polymerase IV (DinB). In order to cope with the risk of stress-induced mutagenesis, cells in all kingdoms of life employ Y-family DNA polymerases to resolve resulting DNA lesions and thus maintaining the integrity of the genome. In Escherichia coli, the DNA polymerase IV, or DinB, plays this crucial role in coping with these type of mutations via the so-called translesion DNA synthesis. Despite the availability of several high-resolution crystal structures, important aspects of the functional repertoire of DinB remain elusive. In this study, we use advanced solution NMR spectroscopy methods in combination with biophysical characterization to elucidate the crucial role of the Thumb domain\nprotein beyond regulatory inactivation of DnaA Nucleotide Excision Repair Is a Predominant Mechanism for Processing Nitrofurazone-Induced DNA Damage in Escherichia coli Roles of the Escherichia coli RecA protein and the global SOS response in effecting DNA polymerase selection in vivo Overproduction of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase DinB (Pol IV) inhibits replication fork progression and is lethal Role of DNA polymerase \u03ba in the maintenance of genomic stability.

Furthermore, these variants are specifically deficient in strand displacement in the absence of RecA filament. We propose that the amino acid patch of highly conserved residues in DinB-like proteins provides a mechanistic explanation for DinB's function in strand exchange and improves our understanding of recombination by providing evidence that RecA plays a role in facilitating DinB's activity during strand exchange. Polymerase exchange on single DNA molecules reveals processivity clamp control of translesion synthesis. Translesion synthesis (TLS) by Y-family DNA polymerases alleviates replication stalling at DNA damage. Ring-shaped processivity clamps play a critical but ill-defined role in mediating exchange between Y-family and replicative polymerases during TLS. By reconstituting TLS at the single-molecule level, we show that the Escherichia coli \u03b2 clamp can simultaneously bind the replicative polymerase (Pol) III and the conserved Y-family Pol IV, enabling exchange\nputative PCNA Interacting Peptide (PIP) motif. We then provided molecular and genetic evidence that this motif could contribute to Pol \u03b4-PCNA interaction indirectly, although it is not a bona fide PIP. Overall, our results suggest that the primary role of PCNA ubiquitination is to allow TLS polymerases to outcompete Pol \u03b4 for PCNA access upon DNA damage. PCNA trimer instability inhibits translesion synthesis by DNA polymerase \u03b7 and by DNA polymerase \u03b4. Translesion synthesis (TLS), the process by which DNA polymerases replicate through DNA lesions, is the source of most DNA damage-induced mutations. Sometimes TLS is carried out by replicative polymerases that have evolved to synthesize DNA on non-damaged templates. Most of the time, however, TLS is carried out by specialized translesion polymerases that have evolved to synthesize DNA on damaged templates. TLS requires the mono-ubiquitylation of the replication accessory factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). PCNA and ubiquitin-modified PCNA\nreplisome components used in the single molecule experiments were purified as previously described: \u03b2; \u03b1, \u03b4 and \u03b4\u2019; \u03b5 and \u03b8; and \u03c4 and \u03c7\u03c8.

Taken together, these results provide a deeper understanding of how E. coli manages the actions of Pol III and Pol IV to coordinate high fidelity replication with potentially error-prone TLS. Introduction Despite the actions of several DNA repair pathways, lesions capable of blocking progression of the replicative DNA polymerase (Pol) persist in the DNA template. Translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) represents one evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which organisms cope with these replication-blocking lesions. In contrast to repair functions, which either reverse or excise the damage, TLS acts to bypass the damaged site using one or more specialized Pol, allowing the replication fork to proceed past the lesion. Depending on the TLS Pol used, the DNA lesion and its sequence context, bypass may be either accurate or inaccurate. Furthermore, due to the fact that most TLS Pols lack intrinsic proofreading activity and possess an open active",

        "desc": "injurious role of DHA in brain development. Crystal structure of human brain-type fatty acid-binding protein FABP7 complexed with palmitic acid. The brain-type fatty acid-binding protein FABP7, which is expressed in astrocytes and neural progenitors, is a member of the intracellular lipid-binding protein family. This protein is not only involved in various cellular functions such as metabolism, inflammation and energy homeostasis, but also in diseases such as cognitive disorders and tumors. Structures of unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid (OA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), bound to FABP7 have been elucidated; however, structures of saturated fatty acids bound to FABP7 remain unknown. To better understand fatty acid recognition, here the crystal structure of human brain-type fatty acid-binding protein FABP7 complexed with palmitic acid (PA), a saturated fatty acid, is reported at a resolution of 1.6 \u00c5. The PA bound to the fatty acid-binding pocket of FABP7 assumed a U-shaped conformation. The\n6 (1 M) significantly decreased Syn oligomerization and aggregation thereby prevented KG-1C and OPC cell death. This study demonstrates that FABP7 triggers \u03b1-synuclein oligomerization through oxidative stress, while FABP7 ligand 6 can inhibit FABP7-induced Syn oligomerization and aggregation, thereby rescuing glial cells and oligodendrocytes from cell death. Fatty acid binding proteins from different tissues show distinct patterns of fatty acid interactions. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) form a family of proteins displaying tissue-specific expression. These proteins are involved in fatty acid (FA) transport and metabolism by mechanisms that also appear to be tissue-specific. Cellular retinoid binding proteins are related proteins with unknown roles in FA transport and metabolism. To better understand the origin of these tissue-specific differences we report new measurements, using the acrylodated intestinal fatty acid binding protein (ADIFAB) method, of the binding of fatty acids (FA) to human fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) from brain, heart, intestine, liver,\nmethod, of the binding of fatty acids (FA) to human fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) from brain, heart, intestine, liver, and myelin. We also measured binding of FA to a retinoic acid (CRABP-I) and a retinol (CRBP-II) binding protein and we have extended to 19 different FA our characterization of the FA-ADIFAB and FA-rat intestinal FABP interactions. These studies extend our previous analyses of human FABP from adipocyte and rat FABPs from heart, intestine, and liver. Binding affinities varied according to the order brain approximately myelin approximately heart > liver > intestine > CRABP > CRBP. In contrast to previous studies, no protein revealed a high degree of selectivity for particular FA. The results indicate that FA solubility (hydrophobicity) plays a major role in governing binding affinities; affinities tend to increase with increasing hydrophobicity (decreasing solubility) of the FA. However, our results also reveal that, with the exception of the\nlocalization, and the accumulation of FABP7-OA complex in the nucleus induced the formation of nuclear lipid droplet (nLD), as well as an increase in colocalization of nLD with promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) nuclear bodies. Furthermore, OA increased mRNA levels of proliferation-related genes in FABP7-expressing cells through histone acetylation. Interestingly, these OA-boosted functions were abrogated in FABP7-knockout cells and mutant FABP7-overexpressing cells. Thus, our findings suggest that FABP7-OA intracellular interaction may modulate nLD formation and the epigenetic status thereby enhancing transcription of proliferation-regulating genes, ultimately driving tumour cell proliferation. Fatty acid-binding protein 7 triggers \u03b1-synuclein oligomerization in glial cells and oligodendrocytes associated with oxidative stress. We previously show that fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3) triggers \u03b1-synuclein (Syn) accumulation and induces dopamine neuronal cell death in Parkinson disease mouse model. But the role of fatty acid-binding protein 7 (FABP7) in the brain remains unclear. In this study we investigated whether FABP7 was involved\nDocosahexaenoic acid up-regulates both PI3K/AKT-dependent FABP7-PPAR\u03b3 interaction and MKP3 that enhance GFAP in developing rat brain astrocytes. The astrocyte marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), has essential functions in the brain, but may trigger astroglial scarring when expressed in excess. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an n-3 fatty acid that is protective during brain development. However, the effect of DHA on GFAP levels of developing brain remains unexplored. Here, we detected that treating developing rats with DHA-enriched fish-oil caused dose-dependent GFAP augmentation. We investigated the mechanism promoting GFAP, hypothesizing the participation of fatty acid-binding protein-7 (FABP7), known to bind DHA. We identified that DHA stimulated FABP7 expression in astrocytes, and FABP7-silencing suppressed DHA-induced GFAP, indicating FABP7-mediated GFAP increase. Further investigation proved FABP7 expression to be phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)/AKT and nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR\u03b3)-dependent. We found that PI3K/AKT activated PPAR\u03b3 that triggered FABP7 expression via PPAR\u03b3-responsive elements within its gene.\nprotein family in regulating neuronal lipid signaling. Oleic acid-bound FABP7 drives glioma cell proliferation through regulation of nuclear lipid droplet formation. Fatty acid-binding protein 7 (FABP7), one of the fatty acid (FA) chaperones involved in the modulation of intracellular FA metabolism, is highly expressed in glioblastoma, and its expression is associated with decreased patients' prognosis. Previously, we demonstrated that FABP7 requires its binding partner to exert its function and that a mutation in the FA-binding site of FABP7 affects tumour biology. Here, we explored the role of FA ligand binding for FABP7 function in tumour proliferation and examined the mechanism of FABP7 and ligand interaction in tumour biology. We discovered that among several FA treatment, oleic acid (OA) boosted cell proliferation of FABP7-expressing cells. In turn, OA increased FABP7 nuclear localization, and the accumulation of FABP7-OA complex in the nucleus induced the formation of nuclear lipid droplet (nLD), as well\nto bind to the fatty acid-binding pocket in a U-shaped conformation, compared with the cis configurations of OA or DHA. This, together with the length of the aliphatic chain, was considered to be one of the factors determining the binding affinity of PA to FABP7. These results provide a better understanding of fatty acid recognition by FABP7 and expand the knowledge of the binding of PA to FABPs. Fatty acid binding proteins are novel modulators of synaptic epoxyeicosatrienoic acid signaling in the brain. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) govern intracellular lipid transport to cytosolic organelles and nuclear receptors. More recently, FABP5 has emerged as a key regulator of synaptic endocannabinoid signaling, suggesting that FABPs may broadly regulate the signaling of neuroactive lipids in the brain. Herein, we demonstrate that brain-expressed FABPs (FABP3, FABP5, and FABP7) interact with epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist 15-deoxy-\u039412,14-Prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2).\nperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR\u03b3)-dependent. We found that PI3K/AKT activated PPAR\u03b3 that triggered FABP7 expression via PPAR\u03b3-responsive elements within its gene. Towards identifying FABP7-downstream pathways, we considered our previous report that demonstrated cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (CDK5)-PPAR\u03b3-protein-protein complex to suppress GFAP. We found that the DHA-induced FABP7 underwent protein-protein interaction with PPAR\u03b3, which impeded CDK5-PPAR\u03b3 formation. Hence, it appeared that enhanced FABP7-PPAR\u03b3 in lieu of CDK5-PPAR\u03b3 resulted in increased GFAP. PI3K/AKT not only stimulated formation of FABP7-PPAR\u03b3 protein-protein complex, but also up-regulated a FABP7-independent MAP-kinase-phosphatase-3 pathway that inactivated CDK5 and hence attenuated CDK5-PPAR\u03b3. Overall, our data reveal that via the proximal PI3K/AKT, DHA induces FABP7-PPAR\u03b3, through genomic and non-genomic mechanisms, and MAP-kinase-phosphatase-3 that converged at attenuated CDK5-PPAR\u03b3 and therefore, enhanced GFAP. Accordingly, our study demonstrates a DHA-mediated astroglial hyperactivation, pointing toward a probable injurious role of DHA in brain development. Crystal structure of human brain-type fatty acid-binding protein FABP7 complexed with palmitic acid.\na resolution of 1.6 \u00c5. The PA bound to the fatty acid-binding pocket of FABP7 assumed a U-shaped conformation. The carboxylate moiety of PA interacted with Tyr129, Arg127 and, via a water bridge, with Arg107 and Thr54, whereas its aliphatic chain was stabilized by hydrophobic interactions with Met21, Leu24, Thr30, Thr37, Pro39, Phe58 and Asp77. Structural comparison showed that PA, OA and DHA exhibited unique binding conformations in the fatty acid-binding pocket, stabilized by distinct amino-acid interactions. The binding of PA to FABP7 exhibits a unique binding conformation when compared with other human FABPs (FABP3-FABP5 and FABP8) expressed in other tissues. Based on the crystal and fatty acid structures, it was suggested that PA, which prefers a linear form in nature, required a greater conformational change in its aliphatic chain to bind to the fatty acid-binding pocket in a U-shaped conformation, compared with the cis configurations of OA or DHA.\nof fatty acid-binding protein 7 (FABP7) in the brain remains unclear. In this study we investigated whether FABP7 was involved in synucleinopathies. We showed that FABP7 was co-localized and formed a complex with Syn in Syn-transfected U251 human glioblastoma cells, and treatment with arachidonic acid (100 M) significantly promoted FABP7-induced Syn aggregation, which was associated with cell death. We demonstrated that synthetic FABP7 ligand 6 displayed a high affinity against FABP7 with Kd value of 209 nM assessed in 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (ANS) assay; ligand 6 improved U251 cell survival via disrupting the FABP7-Syn interaction. We showed that activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) by psychosine (10 M) triggered oligomerization of endogenous Syn and FABP7, and induced cell death in both KG-1C human oligodendroglia cells and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). FABP7 ligand 6 (1 M) significantly decreased Syn oligomerization and aggregation thereby prevented KG-1C and OPC cell death. This study demonstrates that\nFABPs (FABP3, FABP5, and FABP7) interact with epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist 15-deoxy-\u039412,14-Prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2). Among these lipids, EETs displayed highest affinities for FABP3 and FABP5, and 11,12-EET was identified as the preferred FABP ligand. Similarly, 15d-PGJ2 interacted with FABP3 and FABP5 while binding to FABP7 was markedly lower. Molecular modeling revealed unique binding interactions of the ligands within the FABP binding pockets and highlighted major contributions of van der Waals clashes and acyl chain solvent exposure in dictating FABP affinity and specificity. Functional studies demonstrated that endogenous EETs gate the strength of CA1 hippocampal glutamate synapses and that this function was impaired following FABP inhibition. As such, the present study reveals that FABPs control EET-mediated synaptic gating, thereby expanding the functional roles of this protein family in regulating neuronal lipid signaling. Oleic acid-bound FABP7 drives glioma cell proliferation through regulation of nuclear lipid droplet\nincrease with increasing hydrophobicity (decreasing solubility) of the FA. However, our results also reveal that, with the exception of the intestinal protein, FABPs exhibit an additional attractive interaction for unsaturated FA that partially compensates for their trend toward lower affinities due to their higher aqueous solubilities. Thermodynamic potentials were determined for oleate and arachidonate binding to a subset of the FABP and retinoid binding proteins. FA binding to all FABPs was enthalpically driven. The DeltaH degrees values for paralogous FABPs, proteins from the same species but different tissues, reveal an exceptionally wide range of values, from -22 kcal/mol (myelin) to -7 kcal/mol (adipocyte). For orthologous FABPs from the same tissue but different species, DeltaH degrees values were similar. In contrast to the enthalpic dominance of FA binding to FABP, binding of FA to CRABP-I was entropically driven. This is consistent with the notion that FA specificity for FABP is determined\nof FA to CRABP-I was entropically driven. This is consistent with the notion that FA specificity for FABP is determined by the enthalpy of binding. Proteins from different tissues also revealed considerable heterogeneity in heat capacity changes upon FA binding, DeltaC(p) values ranged between 0 and -1.3 kcal mol(-1) K(-1). The results demonstrate that thermodynamic parameters are quite different for paralogous but are quite similar for orthologous FABP, suggesting tissue-specific differences in FABP function that may be conserved across species.",

Thus, our current study explores the structural basis of Mtb-RNase J and might provide a promising candidate in pharmacological treatment for tuberculosis. Acetylation regulates the oligomerization state and activity of RNase J, the Helicobacter pylori major ribonuclease. In the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori, post-transcriptional regulation relies strongly on the activity of the essential ribonuclease RNase J. Here, we elucidated the crystal and cryo-EM structures of RNase J and determined that it assembles into dimers and tetramers in vitro. We found that RNase J extracted from H. pylori is acetylated on multiple lysine residues. Alanine substitution of several of these residues impacts on H. pylori morphology, and thus on RNase J function in vivo. Mutations of Lysine 649 modulates RNase J oligomerization in vitro, which in turn influences ribonuclease activity in vitro. Our structural analyses of RNase\nthat in H. pylori, the mRNA-degrading machinery is associated with the translation apparatus, a situation till now thought to be restricted to eukaryotes and archaea. Molecular basis for the recognition and cleavage of RNA by the bifunctional 5'-3' exo/endoribonuclease RNase J. RNase J is a key member of the \u03b2-CASP family of metallo-\u03b2-lactamases involved in the maturation and turnover of RNAs in prokaryotes. The B. subtilis enzyme possesses both 5'-3' exoribonucleolytic and endonucleolytic activity, an unusual property for a ribonuclease. Here, we present the crystal structure of T. thermophilus RNase J bound to a 4 nucleotide RNA. The structure reveals an RNA-binding channel that illustrates how the enzyme functions in 5'-3' exoribonucleolytic mode and how it can function as an endonuclease. A second, negatively charged tunnel leads from the active site, and is ideally located to evacuate the cleaved nucleotide in 5'-3' exonucleolytic mode. We show that B. subtilis RNase\nRNase J paralogs could provide a strategy for functional improvisation utilizing differences in intracellular concentration, quaternary structure, and distinct active site architecture despite overall structural similarity. Structural insights into catalysis and dimerization enhanced exonuclease activity of RNase J. RNase J is a conserved ribonuclease that belongs to the \u03b2-CASP family of nucleases. It possesses both endo- and exo-ribonuclease activities, which play a key role in pre-rRNA maturation and mRNA decay. Here we report high-resolution crystal structures of Deinococcus radiodurans RNase J complexed with RNA or uridine 5'-monophosphate in the presence of manganese ions. Biochemical and structural studies revealed that RNase J uses zinc ions for two-metal-ion catalysis. One residue conserved among RNase J orthologues (motif B) forms specific electrostatic interactions with the scissile phosphate of the RNA that is critical for the catalysis and product stabilization. The additional manganese ion, which is coordinated by conserved residues at the dimer interface,\nensures the 5'-monophosphate preferential exoribonucleolysis. To achieve exoribonucleolytic processivity, the 5'-monophosphate-binding pocket and nucleotide +4 binding site anchor RNA within the catalytic track; the 5'-capping residue Leu37 of the sandwich pocket coupled with the 5'-monophosphate-binding pocket are dedicated to translocating and controlling the RNA orientation for each exoribonucleolytic cycle. The processive-exoribonucleolysis mechanism was verified as conserved in bacterial RNase J and also exposes striking parallels with the non-homologous eukaryotic 5'-3' exoribonuclease, Xrn1. The findings in this work shed light on not only the molecular mechanism of the RNase J family, but also the evolutionary convergence of divergent exoribonucleases. Structural and biochemical characteristics of two Staphylococcus epidermidis RNase J paralogs RNase J1 and RNase J2. RNase J enzymes are metallohydrolases that are involved in RNA maturation and RNA recycling, govern gene expression in bacteria, and catalyze both exonuclease and endonuclease activity. The catalytic activity of RNase J is regulated by multiple\n649 modulates RNase J oligomerization in vitro, which in turn influences ribonuclease activity in vitro. Our structural analyses of RNase J reveal loops that gate access to the active site and rationalizes how acetylation state of K649 can influence activity. We propose acetylation as a regulatory level controlling the activity of RNase J and its potential cooperation with other enzymes of RNA metabolism in H. pylori. Emergence of the \u03b2-CASP ribonucleases: highly conserved and ubiquitous metallo-enzymes involved in messenger RNA maturation and degradation. The \u03b2-CASP ribonucleases, which are found in the three domains of life, have in common a core of 460 residues containing seven conserved sequence motifs involved in the tight binding of two catalytic zinc ions. A hallmark of these enzymes is their ability to catalyze both endo- and exo-ribonucleolytic degradation. Exo-ribonucleolytic degradation proceeds in the 5' to 3' direction and is sensitive to the phosphorylation state of\nribonuclease RNase E. In bacteria lacking RNase E, the existence of a functional RNA degradosome is still an open question. Here, we report that in the bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori, RNA degradation is directed by a minimal RNA degradosome consisting of Hp-RNase J and the only DExD-box RNA helicase of H. pylori, RhpA. We show that the protein complex promotes faster degradation of double-stranded RNA in vitro in comparison with Hp-RNase J alone. The ATPase activity of RhpA is stimulated in the presence of Hp-RNase J, demonstrating that the catalytic capacity of both partners is enhanced upon interaction. Remarkably, both proteins are associated with translating ribosomes and not with individual 30S and 50S subunits. Moreover, Hp-RNase J is not recruited to ribosomes to perform rRNA maturation. Together, our findings imply that in H. pylori, the mRNA-degrading machinery is associated with the translation apparatus, a situation till now thought to be\nfor the catalysis and product stabilization. The additional manganese ion, which is coordinated by conserved residues at the dimer interface, is critical for RNase J dimerization and exonuclease activity. The structures may also shed light on the mechanism of RNase J exo- and endonucleolytic activity switch. Swapping structural determinants of ribonucleases: an energetic analysis of the hinge peptide 16-22. Bovine seminal ribonuclease (BS-RNase) is a homodimeric enzyme strictly homologous to the pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase A). Native BS-RNase is an equilibrium mixture of two distinct dimers differing in the interchange of the N-terminal segments and in their biological properties. The loop 16-22 plays a fundamental role on the relative stability of the two isomers. Both the primary and tertiary structures of the RNase A differ substantially from those of the seminal ribonuclease in the loop region 16-22. To analyze the possible stable conformations of this loop in both enzymes, structure predictions\nStructural insights into RNase J that plays an essential role in Mycobacterium tuberculosis RNA metabolism. Ribonucleases (RNases) are responsible for RNA metabolism. RNase J, the core enzyme of the RNA degradosome, plays an essential role in global mRNA decay. Emerging evidence showed that the RNase J of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb-RNase J) could be an excellent target for treating Mtb infection. Here, crystal structures of Mtb-RNase J in apo-state and complex with the single-strand RNA reveal the conformational change upon RNA binding and hydrolysis. Mtb-RNase J forms an active homodimer through the interactions between the \u03b2-CASP and the \u03b2-lactamase domain. Knockout of RNase J slows the growth rate and changes the colony morphologies and cell length in Mycobacterium smegmatis, which is restored by RNase J complementation. Finally, RNA-seq analysis shows that the knockout strain significantly changes the expression levels of 49 genes in metabolic pathways. Thus, our current study explores the\nRNA metabolism highlighting their potential vulnerability as drug targets. New molecular insights into an archaeal RNase J reveal a conserved processive exoribonucleolysis mechanism of the RNase J family. RNase J, a prokaryotic 5'-3' exo/endoribonuclease, contributes to mRNA decay, rRNA maturation and post-transcriptional regulation. Yet the processive-exoribonucleolysis mechanism remains obscure. Here, we solved the first RNA-free and RNA-bound structures of an archaeal RNase J, and through intensive biochemical studies provided detailed mechanistic insights into the catalysis and processivity. Distinct dimerization/tetramerization patterns were observed for archaeal and bacterial RNase Js, and unique archaeal Loops I and II were found involved in RNA interaction. A hydrogen-bond-network was identified for the first time that assists catalysis by facilitating efficient proton transfer in the catalytic center. A conserved 5'-monophosphate-binding pocket that coordinates the RNA 5'-end ensures the 5'-monophosphate preferential exoribonucleolysis. To achieve exoribonucleolytic processivity, the 5'-monophosphate-binding pocket and nucleotide +4 binding site anchor RNA within\nribonuclease in the loop region 16-22. To analyze the possible stable conformations of this loop in both enzymes, structure predictions have been attempted, according to a procedure described by Palmer and Scheraga [Palmer, K. A. & Scheraga, H. A. (1992) J. Comput. Chem. 13, 329-350]. Results compare well with experimental x-ray structures and clarify the structural determinants that are responsible for the swapping of the N-terminal domains and for the peculiar properties of BS-RNase. Minimal modifications of RNase A sequence needed to form a stable swapped dimer are also predicted. A minimal bacterial RNase J-based degradosome is associated with translating ribosomes. Protein complexes directing messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation are present in all kingdoms of life. In Escherichia coli, mRNA degradation is performed by an RNA degradosome organized by the major ribonuclease RNase E. In bacteria lacking RNase E, the existence of a functional RNA degradosome is still an open question.\nlittle is known about mechanisms that shape the transcriptome by regulating RNA decay rates. The aim of the present study is to identify the core components of the RNA degradosome of M. tuberculosis and to analyse their function in RNA metabolism. Using an approach involving cross-linking to 4-thiouridine-labelled RNA, we mapped the mycobacterial RNA-bound proteome and identified degradosome-related enzymes polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), ATP-dependent RNA helicase (RhlE), ribonuclease E (RNase E) and ribonuclease J (RNase J) as major components. We then carried out affinity purification of eGFP-tagged recombinant constructs to identify protein-protein interactions. This identified further interactions with cold-shock proteins and novel KH-domain proteins. Engineering and transcriptional profiling of strains with a reduced level of expression of core degradosome ribonucleases provided evidence of important pleiotropic roles of the enzymes in mycobacterial RNA metabolism highlighting their potential vulnerability as drug targets. New molecular insights into an archaeal RNase J reveal a conserved\nand exo-ribonucleolytic degradation. Exo-ribonucleolytic degradation proceeds in the 5' to 3' direction and is sensitive to the phosphorylation state of the 5' end of a transcript. Recent phylogenomic analyses have shown that the \u03b2-CASP ribonucleases can be partitioned into two major subdivisions that correspond to orthologs of eukaryal CPSF73 and bacterial RNase J. We discuss the known functions of the CPSF73 and RNase J orthologs, their association into complexes, and their structure as it relates to mechanism of action. Eukaryal CPSF73 is part of a large multiprotein complex that is involved in the maturation of the 3' end of RNA Polymerase II transcripts and the polyadenylation of messenger RNA. RNase J1 and J2 are paralogs in Bacillus subtilis that are involved in the degradation of messenger RNA and the maturation of non-coding RNA. RNase J1 and J2 co-purify as a heteromeric complex and there is recent evidence that they interact\nexpression in bacteria, and catalyze both exonuclease and endonuclease activity. The catalytic activity of RNase J is regulated by multiple mechanisms which include oligomerization, conformational changes to aid substrate recognition, and the metal cofactor at the active site. However, little is known of how RNase J paralogs differ in expression and activity. Here we describe structural and biochemical features of two Staphylococcus epidermidis RNase J paralogs, RNase J1 and RNase J2. RNase J1 is a homodimer with exonuclease activity aided by two metal cofactors at the active site. RNase J2, on the other hand, has endonuclease activity and one metal ion at the active site and is predominantly a monomer. We note that the expression levels of these enzymes vary across Staphylococcal strains. Together, these observations suggest that multiple interacting RNase J paralogs could provide a strategy for functional improvisation utilizing differences in intracellular concentration, quaternary structure, and distinct active\nJ2. Unlike RNase J1, surprisingly little is known about the regulatory function and protein interactions of RNase J2, despite being a central pleiotropic regulator for the streptococci and other closely related organisms. Using crosslink coimmunoprecipitation in Streptococcus mutans, we have identified the major proteins found within RNase J2 protein complexes located in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane. In both subcellular fractions, RNase J2 exhibited the most robust interactions with RNase J1, while additional transient and/or weaker \"degradosome-like\" interactions were also detected. In addition, RNase J2 exhibits multiple novel interactions that have not been previously reported for any RNase J proteins, some of which were highly biased for either the cytoplasmic or membrane fractions. We also determined that the RNase J2 C-terminal domain (CTD) encodes a structure that is likely conserved among RNase J enzymes and may have an analogous function to the C-terminal portion of RNase E. While\nlikely conserved among RNase J enzymes and may have an analogous function to the C-terminal portion of RNase E. While we did observe a number of parallels between the RNase J2 interactome and the E. coli degradosome paradigm, our results suggest that S. mutans degradosomes are either unlikely to exist or are quite distinct from those of E. coli.\nsite, and is ideally located to evacuate the cleaved nucleotide in 5'-3' exonucleolytic mode. We show that B. subtilis RNase J1, which shows processive behavior on long RNAs, behaves distributively for substrates less than 5 nucleotides in length. We propose a model involving the binding of the RNA to the surface of the \u03b2-CASP domain to explain the enzyme's processive action. Examining the Protein Interactome and Subcellular Localization of RNase J2 Complexes in Streptococcus mutans. Regulated RNA turnover is vital for the control of gene expression in all cellular life. In Escherichia coli, this process is largely controlled by a stable degradosome complex containing RNase E and a variety of additional enzymes. In the Firmicutes phylum, species lack RNase E and often encode the paralogous enzymes RNase J1 and RNase J2. Unlike RNase J1, surprisingly little is known about the regulatory function and protein interactions of RNase J2, despite being\nof non-coding RNA. RNase J1 and J2 co-purify as a heteromeric complex and there is recent evidence that they interact with other enzymes to form a bacterial RNA degradosome. Finally, we speculate on the evolutionary origin of \u03b2-CASP ribonucleases and on their functions in Archaea. Orthologs of CPSF73 with endo- and exo-ribonuclease activity are strictly conserved throughout the archaea suggesting a role for these enzymes in the maturation and/or degradation of messenger RNA. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: RNA Decay mechanisms. Proteomic and transcriptomic experiments reveal an essential role of RNA degradosome complexes in shaping the transcriptome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The phenotypic adjustments of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are commonly inferred from the analysis of transcript abundance. While mechanisms of transcriptional regulation have been extensively analysed in mycobacteria, little is known about mechanisms that shape the transcriptome by regulating RNA decay rates.

The RFX protein family includes members from yeast to humans, which function in various biological systems, and share a DNA-binding domain and a conserved C-terminal region. In the human transcription regulator RFX1, the conserved C terminus is an independent functional domain, which mediates dimerization and transcriptional repression. This dimerization domain has a unique ability to mediate the formation of two alternative homodimeric DNA-protein complexes, the upper of which has been linked to repression. Here, we localize the complex formation capacity to several different RFX1 C-terminal subregions, each of which can function independently to generate the upper complex and repress transcription, thus correlating complex formation with repression. To gain an evolutionary perspective, we have examined whether the different properties of the RFX1 C terminus exist in\nnonpalindromic DNA sites resembling the EP element of the hepatitis B virus enhancer, which generate similar DNA-protein complexes. The upper EP complex contains homodimers of the transcription regulator RFX1. We show that RFX1 possesses a split, extended dimerization domain composed of several evolutionarily conserved boxes, one of which was previously shown to mediate dimerization. Such an unusually long and complex dimerization domain could potentially serve for generating multiple complexes. In addition to the previously characterized complex, RFX1 generated a novel DNA-protein complex of extremely low mobility, formed only with palindromic DNA sites. Different deletions within the dimerization domain altered the relative abundance of the two complexes, suggesting an interplay between them. Formation of the low mobility complex correlated with transcriptional repression, in that both activities were mediated by several portions of the conserved region. Our results propose a mechanism by which the extended dimerization domain mediates the formation of alternative\nRFX4. RFX4 contains evolutionarily conserved regions, including a RFX-type DNA-binding domain, a dimerization domain, and other conserved regions, and is closely related to RFX1, RFX2, and RFX3 in structure. The expression of RFX4 is restricted to testis. In vitro synthesized RFX4 protein bound to typical RFX binding sites in a sequence-dependent manner. Immunoprecipitation analyses showed that RFX4 interacts physically with RFX2, RFX3, and RFX4 itself but not with RFX1. In contrast to other mammalian RFX members that form dimers, RFX4 is revealed to have no distinct transcriptional activation domains. By using a chimeric protein of RFX1 and RFX4, the C-terminal domain of RFX4 was shown to be a possible transcriptional repression domain. Taken together, these results indicate that RFX4 is the first mammalian member of RFX family without transcriptional activation capacity and might function through selective interactions with other RFX members in transcriptional regulation.

Although the mechanisms by which RFX1 exerts its activation or repression activity have only been partially elucidated, it is known that RFX1 behaves as a potent transcriptional repressor in CD4+ T cells. In these cells, RFX1 binds to target genes, including CD11a and CD70, and recruits the transcriptional co-repressors histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and DNA methyltransferase1 (DNMT1). This leads to local histone hypoacetylation and DNA hypermethylation and consequently to the suppression of target gene expression. In a previous study, we found that RFX1 is significantly down-regulated in SLE CD4+ T cells. We also demonstrated that RFX1 forms a stable complex with HDAC1 and DNMT1 in the nucleus of CD4+ T cells, and that down-regulating RFX1 in these cells increases histone acetylation and decreases DNA methylation at the CD11a and CD70 promoter\nHDAC1 was recruited to Id2-SRE in serum-starved cells. These results demonstrate that RFX1 mediates the immediate early response of the Id2 gene by serum stimulation and suggest that the function of RFX1 is regulated intramolecularly in its suppression in growth-arrested cells. Our results unveil a novel transcriptional control of immediate early gene expression.\nwith histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and the mammalian transcriptional repressor (mSin3B), whereas RFX1 preferably interacts with HDAC1 and mSin3A. HDAC2 cooperates with RFX5 to down-regulate collagen promoter activity, whereas HDAC1 enhances inhibition of collagen promoter activity by RFX1. Interferon-gamma promotes the recruitment of RFX5/HDAC2/mSin3B to the collagen transcription start site but decreases the occupancy by RFX1/mSin3A as manifested by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. RFX1 binds to the methylated collagen sequence with much higher affinity than unmethylated sequence, recruiting more HDAC1 and mSin3A. The DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, which inhibits DNA methylation, reduces RFX1/HDAC1 binding to the collagen transcription start site in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Finally, both RFX1 and RFX5 are acetylated in vivo. Trichostatin A stimulates the acetylation of RFX proteins and activates the collagen promoter activity. Collectively, our data strongly indicate two separate pathways for RFX proteins to repress collagen gene expression as follows: one for RFX5/HDAC2 in interferon-gamma-mediated repression,\ncapacity and might function through selective interactions with other RFX members in transcriptional regulation. Regulatory factor for X-box family proteins differentially interact with histone deacetylases to repress collagen alpha2(I) gene (COL1A2) expression. Our studies indicate that the regulatory factor for X-box (RFX) family proteins repress collagen alpha2(I) gene (COL1A2) expression (Xu, Y., Wang, L., Buttice, G., Sengupta, P. K., and Smith, B. D. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 49134-49144; Xu, Y., Wang, L., Buttice, G., Sengupta, P. K., and Smith, B. D. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 41319-41332). In this study, we examined the mechanism(s) underlying the repression of collagen gene by RFX proteins. Two members of the RFX family, RFX1 and RFX5, associate with distinct sets of co-repressors on the collagen transcription start site in vitro. RFX5 specifically interacts with histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and the mammalian transcriptional repressor (mSin3B), whereas RFX1 preferably interacts with HDAC1 and mSin3A. HDAC2\none hand mediates nuclear import of RFX1, and on the other hand inhibits its association with the nucleus and binding to DNA. The participation of the acidic region in both activities suggests a mechanism by which the nuclear import and DNA-binding activity of RFX1 may be coordinately regulated by phosphorylation by kinases such as PKC. RFX1 mediates the serum-induced immediate early response of Id2 gene expression. Id2, a negative regulator of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, is involved in regulating cell differentiation and proliferation. To obtain insight into the role of Id2 in cell cycle control, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the immediate early response of Id2 expression to serum stimulation in NIH3T3 cells. Luciferase reporter analysis with deletion and point mutants demonstrated the serum response element of Id2 (Id2-SRE) to be a consensus binding site for RFX1 (regulatory factor for X-box 1) present 3.0 kb upstream of the transcription initiation\npromoter efficiently functioned in a tissue- and lineage-specific manner. To further investigate RFX functions on transcription, full-length and deletion mutants of RFX1 were targeted to DNA through fusion to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. Tissue- and lineage-specific transcriptional activation with the full-length RFX1 fusion plasmid on a reporter controlled by GAL4 binding sites was observed. Distinct activation and repression domains within the RFX1 protein were further mapped. Our findings suggest that RFX proteins are transcription factors that contribute to the activity and lineage specificity of the IL-5Ralpha promoter by directly binding to a target cis element and cooperating with other tissue- and lineage-specific cofactors. RFX1, a single DNA-binding protein with a split dimerization domain, generates alternative complexes. The transcription of various viral and cellular genes is regulated by palindromic and nonpalindromic DNA sites resembling the EP element of the hepatitis B virus enhancer, which generate similar DNA-protein complexes. The upper\nto the recruitment of SUV39H1, HDAC1 and DNMT1 core complexes, which together inhibit the expression of RFX1 target genes. However, in CD4+ T cells of patients with SLE, the combined activity of these RFX1-dependent transcriptional repressor complexes is insufficient due to the down-regulation of RFX1, thus leading to the de-repression of auto-immune related target genes, such as CD11a and CD70.

Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests. Authors' contributions MZ and XW contributed equally to this work. MZ and XW performed most of the\nrepression. To gain an evolutionary perspective, we have examined whether the different properties of the RFX1 C terminus exist in the two yeast RFX proteins, which are involved in signaling pathways. Replacement of the RFX1 C terminus with those of Sak1 and Crt1, its orthologues from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively, and analysis of fusions with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, revealed that the ability to generate the two alternative complexes is conserved in the RFX family, from S. cerevisiae to man. While sharing this unique biochemical property, the three C termini differed from each other in their ability to mediate dimerization and transcriptional repression. In both functions, RFX1, Sak1, and Crt1 showed high capacity, moderate capacity, and no capacity, respectively. This comparative analysis of the RFX proteins, representing different evolutionary stages, suggests a gradual development of the conserved C terminus, from the appearance of the ancestral motif (Crt1), to\nof the conserved region. Our results propose a mechanism by which the extended dimerization domain mediates the formation of alternative homodimeric complexes, which differ in the nature of the intersubunit interaction. By participating in different types of interactions, this domain may regulate the relative abundance of the different complexes, thus affecting transcriptional activity. RFX1 regulates CD70 and CD11a expression in lupus T cells by recruiting the histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 Introduction Regulatory factor X-box 1 (RFX1) can interact with DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and RFX1 down-regulation contributes to DNA hypomethylation and histone H3 hyperacetylation at the cluster of differentiation (CD) 11a and CD70 promoters in CD4+ T cells of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This leads to CD11a and CD70 overexpression, thereby triggering autoimmune responses. In order to provide more insight into the epigenetic mechanisms leading to the deregulation of autoimmune-related genes in SLE, we\nand that down-regulating RFX1 in these cells increases histone acetylation and decreases DNA methylation at the CD11a and CD70 promoter regions, epigenetic changes that lead to the de-repression of CD11a and CD70. Another epigenetic mechanism for repressing gene transcription is the methylation of specific lysine residues in histones, a modification that is critical to shaping repressive chromatin structures. Among the histone methyltransferases involved in this process, the best characterized is the suppressor of variegation 3-9 (Drosophila) homolog 1 (SUV39H1). By tri-methylating lysine 9 in histone H3 (H3K9) SUV39H1 is able to generate a binding site for the transcriptional repressor heterochromatin-associated protein 1 (HP1). Therefore, H3K9 tri-methylation is involved in gene repression and serves as a marker for the establishment of a stable heterochromatin configuration. In the present study, we show that RFX1 binds to CD11a and CD70 promoter DNA in CD4+ T cells where it recruits SUV39H1 and regulates H3K9\ngroup. RFX1 overexpression up-regulates H3K9 tri-methylation at the CD11a and CD70 promoter loci We have previously shown that RFX1 overexpression can increase DNA methylation and decrease histone acetylation levels at the CD11a and CD70 promoters, leading to reduced CD11a and CD70 expression in SLE CD4+ T cells. In this study, we asked whether overexpressing RFX1 could restore the aberrant histone tri-methylation status of SLE CD4+ T cells. Figure 5a shows a significant increase in RFX1 protein levels in SLE CD4+ T cells transfected with the RFX1 expression vector pSG5-RFX1. CD11a and CD70 promoter H3K9 tri-methylation levels were significantly higher in RFX1-overexpressing SLE CD4+ T cells compared to control-transfected SLE CD4+ T cells (Figure 5b), and this change correlated with a decrease in the expression of CD11a and CD70 mRNA (Figure 5c).

CD11a and CD70 promoters were identified by PCR amplification of the DNA fragments precipitated with SUV39H1 antibody. RFX1 down-regulation causes overexpression of CD11a and CD70 by reducing promoter H3K9 tri-methylation levels To assess whether RFX1 is involved in regulating H3K9 tri-methylation levels at the CD11a and CD70 promoter loci, we knocked-down RFX1 expression in healthy CD4+ T cells by transfecting with an RFX1-siRNA expression vector, pSUPER.RFX1. Compared with cells transfected with empty pSUPER vector (negative control), RFX1 protein levels were decreased by approximately 90% 48 hours after pSUPER.RFX1 transfection (Figure 4a). We then used qPCR to measure the levels of CD11a and CD70 promoter DNA fragments after immunoprecipitating histone-DNA complexes with anti-tri-methylated H3K9 antibody. Significantly less CD11a and CD70 promoter DNA was amplified in pSUPER.RFX1-transfected CD4+ T cells compared with negative controls, indicating a significant reduction\nCD11a and CD70 promoter DNA was amplified in pSUPER.RFX1-transfected CD4+ T cells compared with negative controls, indicating a significant reduction in H3K9 tri-methylation levels (Figure 4b).

RFX1 overexpression up-regulates H3K9 tri-methylation at the CD11a and CD70 promoter loci We have previously shown that RFX1 overexpression\nbe a consensus binding site for RFX1 (regulatory factor for X-box 1) present 3.0 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site of Id2. Gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the binding of RFX1 to Id2-SRE in vitro and in vivo, respectively. In both assays, RFX1 binding was observed not only in serum-stimulated cells, but also in serum-starved cells. Knockdown of RFX1 by RNA interference disturbed the immediate early response of Id2 expression in cells and abrogated the Id2-SRE-mediated induction of luciferase activity by serum. These alterations were rescued by the introduction of RNA interference-resistant RFX1 into cells. On the other hand, in the Id2-SRE-mediated reporter assay, RFX1 with an N-terminal deletion abrogated the serum response, whereas RFX1 with a C-terminal deletion enhanced the reporter activity in serum-starved cells. Furthermore, HDAC1 was recruited to Id2-SRE in serum-starved cells. These results demonstrate that RFX1 mediates the immediate early response of the\nan increasing interest in the role of regulatory factor X1 (RFX1) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) during neural development. However, there are few reports about their interaction. METHODS: We extracted RNA and performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to identify RFX1 expression in imprinting control region (ICR) mouse tissues, analyzed RFX1 domains and motif consensus by comparing public databases on the Internet, tested the motif consensus with affinity-capture and western blotting experiments with mouse brain tissue, and predicted the binding sites of RFX1 in promoter regions of mouse RBPs genes.RESULTS: The expression of RFX1 was higher in embryonic brain compared to embryonic kidney, heart, and liver, and its expression level was relatively stable and higher in mouse embryonic brain than neonatal brain. RFX1 had several domains, including domain A as an activation domain, DBD as a DNA binding domain, domain B and C which played an important role in dimerization,",

Our findings define a novel function for the beta-subunit through its Src homology 3 domain and establish a link between voltage-gated calcium channel activity and the cell endocytic machinery. Hydrogen bonds as molecular timers for slow inactivation in voltage-gated potassium channels. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels enable potassium efflux and membrane repolarization in excitable tissues. Many Kv channels undergo a progressive loss of ion conductance in the presence of a prolonged voltage stimulus, termed slow inactivation, but the atomic determinants that regulate the kinetics of this process remain obscure. Using a combination of synthetic amino acid analogs and concatenated channel subunits we establish two H-bonds near the extracellular surface of the channel that endow Kv channels with a mechanism to time the entry into slow inactivation: an intra-subunit H-bond between Asp447 and Trp434 and an inter-subunit H-bond connecting Tyr445 to Thr439. Breaking\ntriple mutation in the middle of the transmembrane (TM) segment of KCNE3 introduces KCNE1-like effects on the second S4 movement and the gate. In addition, we show that differences in two residues at the external end of the KCNE TM segments underlie differences in the effects of the different KCNEs on the first S4 movement and the voltage sensor-to-gate coupling. Structural and functional characterization of Kv6.2 a new gamma-subunit of voltage-gated potassium channel. We have cloned and functionally expressed Kv6.2, a new member of the Kv6 subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channel subunits. The human Kv6.2 (KCNF2) gene was mapped at 18q22-18q23. Kv6.2 mRNA is preferentially expressed in rat and human myocard. Rat and human Kv6.2 subunits appear to be unable to form functional Kv channels in a heterologous expression system, but, when coexpressed with Kv2.1 alpha subunits, heteromultimeric Kv channels were formed mediating voltage-activated delayed-rectifier type outward currents.

RESULTS KCNQ1 is a Kv channel \u03b1 subunit in the S4 superfamily of voltage-gated ion channels. Each KCNQ1 \u03b1 subunit bears six transmembrane helices with the fourth, S4, being considered the principal component of voltage sensing (Fig. 1 A). MiRPs are predicted to span the membrane once (Fig. 1 A). Here, alignment of S4 domains from all known eukaryotic voltage-gated cation channel \u03b1 subunits revealed a unique paucity of net positive charge (+3) in the KCNQ1 S4, compared with +7 in Shaker, +5 in other KCNQ channels, +6 in HCN channels, and at least +5 in voltage-gated sodium and voltage-gated calcium channels\nmotif in the sixth transmembrane segment. This motif is conserved among all alpha-subunits of the Kv1, Kv2, Kv3, and Kv4 subfamilies, whereas the second proline is not conserved in any modulatory alpha-subunit. Exchanging this proline in Kv2.1 for the corresponding residue of Kv9.3 resulted in channels (Kv2.1-P410T) that show all hallmarks of the regulation of Kv2.1 by Kv9.3. The effect prevailed in heteromeric channels following co-expression of Kv2.1-P410T with Kv2.1. These data suggest that the alteration of the PXP motif is an important determinant of the regulatory function of modulatory alpha-subunits. V374A KCND3 Pathogenic Variant Associated With Paroxysmal Ataxia Exacerbations. OBJECTIVE: Ataxia channelopathies share common features such as slow motor progression and variable degrees of cognitive dysfunction. Mutations in potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily D member 3 (KCND3), encoding the K+ channel, Kv4.3, are associated with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 19, allelic with SCA22. Mutations in potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily C member\naccelerating degradation of MiRP3-BK complexes. The findings suggest a role for MiRP3 modulation of BK-dependent urinary potassium excretion. Assembly of voltage-gated potassium channels. Conserved hydrophilic motifs determine subfamily-specific interactions between the alpha-subunits. Voltage-gated potassium (K+) channels are assembled by four identical or homologous alpha-subunits to form a tetrameric complex with a central conduction pore for potassium ions. Most of the cloned genes for the alpha-subunits are classified into four subfamilies: Kv1 (Shaker), Kv2 (Shab), Kv3 (Shaw), and Kv4 (Shal). Subfamily-specific assembly of heteromeric K+ channel complexes has been observed in vitro and in vivo, which contributes to the diversity of K+ currents. However, the molecular codes that mediate the subfamily-specific association remain unknown. To understand the molecular basis of the subfamily-specific assembly, we tested the protein-protein interactions of different regions of alpha-subunits. We report here that the cytoplasmic NH2-terminal domains of Kv1, Kv2, Kv3, and Kv4 subfamilies each associate to\nof alpha-subunits. We report here that the cytoplasmic NH2-terminal domains of Kv1, Kv2, Kv3, and Kv4 subfamilies each associate to form homomultimers. Using the yeast two-hybrid system and eight K+ channel genes, two genes (one isolated from rat and one from Drosophila) from each subfamily, we demonstrated that the associations to form heteromultimers by the NH2-terminal domains are strictly subfamily-specific. These subfamily-specific associations suggest a molecular basis for the selective formation of heteromultimeric channels in vivo. Structural determinants of the regulation of the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv2.1 by the modulatory \u03b1-subunit Kv9.3. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels containing alpha-subunits of the Kv2 subfamily mediate delayed rectifier currents in excitable cells. Channels formed by Kv2.1 alpha-subunits inactivate from open- and closed states with both forms of inactivation serving different physiological functions. Here we show that open- and closed-state inactivation of Kv2.1 can be distinguished by the sensitivity to intracellular tetraethylammonium and extracellular\nentry into slow inactivation: an intra-subunit H-bond between Asp447 and Trp434 and an inter-subunit H-bond connecting Tyr445 to Thr439. Breaking of either interaction triggers slow inactivation by means of a local disruption in the selectivity filter, while severing the Tyr445-Thr439 H-bond is likely to communicate this conformational change to the adjacent subunit(s). DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01289.001. Molecular studies of voltage-gated potassium channels. The cloning and characterization of the voltage-activated Shaker potassium channel gene in Drosophila have led to the identification of structural elements involved in potassium channel gating. As found for the voltage-activated sodium channel, the S4 segment, located in the conserved core of the protein, plays a central role in voltage-dependent activation. Potassium channels appear to be formed by the assembly of several polypeptides into multisubunit channels. This is directly analogous to the proposed folding of the four internally homologous pseudosubunits of sodium and calcium channels. The amino- and carboxy-terminal regions\na mechanism for regulating channel activity. Kv channel interaction with accessory subunits provides mechanisms for channels to respond to stimuli beyond changes in membrane potential. Here, we demonstrate that KCNE4 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E member 4), but not KCNE2, functions as an inhibitory Kv1.3 partner in leukocytes. Kv1.3 trafficking, targeting and activity are altered by the presence of KCNE4. KCNE4 decreases current density, slows activation, accelerates inactivation, increases cumulative inactivation, retains Kv1.3 in the ER and impairs channel targeting to lipid raft microdomains. KCNE4 associates with Kv1.3 in the ER and decreases the number of Kv1.3 channels at the cell surface, which diminishes cell excitability. Kv1.3 and KCNE4 are differentially regulated upon activation or immunosuppression in macrophages. Thus, lipopolysaccharide-induced activation increases Kv1.3 and KCNE4 mRNA, whereas dexamethasone triggers a decrease in Kv1.3 with no changes in KCNE4. The channelosome composition determines the activity and affects surface expression and membrane\nSTATEMENT Mutations in a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit, KV8.2, underlie a blinding inherited photoreceptor dystrophy, indicating an important role for these channels in human vision. Here, we have defined the localization and subunit interactions of KV8.2 channels in primate photoreceptors. We show that the KV8.2 subunit interacts with different Kv2 channels in rods and cones, giving rise to potassium currents with distinct functional properties. Our results provide a molecular basis for retinal dysfunction in patients with mutations in the KCNV2 gene encoding KV8.2. KCNE1 and KCNE3 modulate KCNQ1 channels by affecting different gating transitions. KCNE \u03b2-subunits assemble with and modulate the properties of voltage-gated K+ channels. In the heart, KCNE1 associates with the \u03b1-subunit KCNQ1 to generate the slowly activating, voltage-dependent potassium current (IKs) in the heart that controls the repolarization phase of cardiac action potentials. By contrast, in epithelial cells from the colon, stomach, and kidney, KCNE3 coassembles with\npotential. Because the exceptional charge paucity in the CO2H half of wild-type KCNQ1 S4 is required for formation of constitutively active MiRP2-KCNQ channels, demonstrated by the S4 charge addition (to KCNQ1) and deletion (from KCNQ4) experiments, the results also identify for the first time \u03b1 subunit\u2013specific sequence determinants that dictate the \u03b1 subunit\u2013specific functional effects of MiRPs. Thus, KCNQ1 S4 charge paucity represents a unique specialization among eukaryotic voltage-gated cation channels, permitting KCNQ1 to act either as a constitutively open pore or a voltage-dependent channel in contexts dictated by overlapping expression of specific ancillary subunits, facilitating multiple prominent and diverse roles in mammalian physiology. Supplemental Material Impact of ancillary subunits on ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels generate the outward K(+) ion currents that constitute the primary force in ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium channels comprise tetramers of pore-forming alpha subunits and, in probably most cases in vivo, ancillary or beta\nof their respective ions once the threshold voltage for their activation is attained. This influx of positive ions depolarizes the cell further, activating voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels to allow efflux of K+ ions, repolarizing the cell, and ending the action potential. All voltage-gated cation channels contain four voltage-sensing S4 domains (membrane-spanning \u03b1 helices bearing basic residues) that confer voltage sensitivity. Upon cellular depolarization, S4 undergoes a conformational and/or positional change to the \u201con\u201d position, which is communicated to the channel gate, opening the channel. The exact nature of the movement that S4 undergoes when switching from the \u201coff\u201d to the \u201con\u201d position is a matter of intense debate, with some arguing for a comprehensive shift from the intracellular to the extracellular side of the plasma membrane, while others contend the conformational shift is far more subtle. The KCNQ subfamily of Kv channel \u03b1 subunits contains five known members, KCNQ1\u20135. While\nof expression. Computational modeling predicted an increased Purkinje neuron firing frequency upon reduced Kv4.3 conductance.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that Kv4.3 V374A is likely pathogenic and associated with paroxysmal ataxia exacerbations, a new trait for SCA19/22. The present FDG PET findings contrast with a previous study demonstrating widespread brain hypometabolism in SCA19/22. Role of the S4 in cooperativity of voltage-dependent potassium channel activation. Charged residues in the S4 transmembrane segment of voltage-gated cation channels play a key role in opening channels in response to changes in voltage across the cell membrane. However, the molecular mechanism of channel activation is not well understood. To learn more about the role of the S4 in channel gating, we constructed chimeras in which S4 segments from several divergent potassium channels, Shab, Shal, Shaw, and Kv3.2, were inserted into a Shaker potassium channel background. These S4 donor channels have distinctly different voltage-dependent gating properties and S4\nKv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels in developmental perspective. Kv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels consist of two types of \u03b1-subunits: (a) electrically-active Kcnb1 \u03b1-subunits and (b) silent or modulatory \u03b1-subunits plus \u03b2-subunits that, similar to silent \u03b1-subunits, also regulate electrically-active subunits. Voltage-gated potassium channels were traditionally viewed, mainly by electrophysiologists, as regulators of the electrical activity of the plasma membrane in excitable cells, a role that is performed by transmembrane protein domains of \u03b1-subunits that form the electric pore. Genetic studies revealed a role for this region of \u03b1-subunits of voltage-gated potassium channels in human neurodevelopmental disorders, such as epileptic encephalopathy. The N- and C-terminal domains of \u03b1-subunits interact to form the cytoplasmic subunit of heterotetrameric potassium channels that regulate electric pores. Subsequent animal studies revealed the developmental functions of Kcnb1-containing voltage-gated potassium channels and illustrated their role during brain development and reproduction. These functions of potassium channels are discussed in this review\nchannel, Kv4.3, are associated with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 19, allelic with SCA22. Mutations in potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily C member 3 (KCNC3), encoding another K+ channel, Kv3.3, cause SCA13. First, a comprehensive phenotype assessment was carried out in a family with autosomal dominant ataxia harboring 2 genetic variants in KCNC3 and KCND3. To evaluate the physiological impact of these variants on channel currents, in vitro studies were performed.METHODS: Clinical and psychometric evaluations, neuroimaging, and genotyping of a family (mother and son) affected by ataxia were carried out. Heterozygous and homozygous Kv3.3 A671V and Kv4.3 V374A variants were evaluated in Xenopus laevis oocytes using 2-electrode voltage-clamp. The influence of Kv4 conductance on neuronal activity was investigated computationally using a Purkinje neuron model.RESULTS: The main clinical findings were consistent with adult-onset ataxia with cognitive dysfunction and acetazolamide-responsive paroxysmal motor exacerbations in the index case. Despite cognitive deficits, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET displayed hypometabolism mainly\nconformational shift is far more subtle. The KCNQ subfamily of Kv channel \u03b1 subunits contains five known members, KCNQ1\u20135. While KCNQ2\u20135 are neuronally expressed and contribute to the M-current, KCNQ1 is expressed in the heart, gastrointestinal epithelia, and inner ear, but not the brain. MiRPs (MinK-related peptides), encoded by KCNE genes, are single transmembrane domain ancillary subunits that coassemble with a wide array of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels and hyperpolarization-activated, cation-nonselective (HCN) channels to alter their gating, conductance, regulation, and pharmacology. KCNQ1 is unique among voltage-gated ion channels in that it can be converted to a voltage-independent, constitutively active, \u201cleak\u201d channel by association with ancillary subunits (MiRP1 and MiRP2). Indeed, even other KCNQ subfamily \u03b1 subunits reportedly interact with MiRPs but do not become leak channels: KCNQ2/3 with MiRP1 and KCNQ4 with MiRP2. This unique loss of voltage dependence is proposed to be crucial to the role of KCNQ1 in\ndecrease in Kv1.3 with no changes in KCNE4. The channelosome composition determines the activity and affects surface expression and membrane localization. Therefore, KCNE4 association might play a crucial role in controlling immunological responses. Our results indicate that KCNE ancillary subunits could be new targets for immunomodulation. Controlling potassium channel activities: Interplay between the membrane and intracellular factors. Neural signaling is based on the regulated timing and extent of channel opening; therefore, it is important to understand how ion channels open and close in response to neurotransmitters and intracellular messengers. Here, we examine this question for potassium channels, an extraordinarily diverse group of ion channels. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels control action-potential waveforms and neuronal firing patterns by opening and closing in response to membrane-potential changes. These effects can be strongly modulated by cytoplasmic factors such as kinases, phosphatases, and small GTPases. A Kv alpha subunit contains six transmembrane segments, including an\nby cytoplasmic factors such as kinases, phosphatases, and small GTPases. A Kv alpha subunit contains six transmembrane segments, including an intrinsic voltage sensor. In contrast, inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels have just two transmembrane segments in each of its four pore-lining alpha subunits. A variety of intracellular second messengers mediate transmitter and metabolic regulation of Kir channels. For example, Kir3 (GIRK) channels open on binding to the G protein betagamma subunits, thereby mediating slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in the brain. Our structure-based functional analysis on the cytoplasmic N-terminal tetramerization domain T1 of the voltage-gated channel, Kv1.2, uncovered a new function for this domain, modulation of voltage gating, and suggested a possible means of communication between second messenger pathways and Kv channels. A yeast screen for active Kir3.2 channels subjected to random mutagenesis has identified residues in the transmembrane segments that are crucial for controlling the opening of Kir3.2 channels. The\ndomain, the functional significance of the Src homology 3 domain remains elusive. Here, we show that injection of isolated beta-subunit Src homology 3 domain into Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing the alpha1-subunit reduces the number of channels in the plasma membrane. This effect is reverted by coexpressing alpha1 with a dominant-negative mutant of dynamin, a GTPase involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis. Full-length beta-subunit also down-regulates voltage-gated calcium channels but only when lacking the alpha-interaction domain. Moreover, isolated Src homology 3 domain and the full-length beta-subunit were found to interact in vitro with dynamin and to internalize the distantly related Shaker potassium channel. These results demonstrate that the beta-subunit regulates the turnover of voltage-gated calcium channels and other proteins in the cell membrane. This effect is mediated by dynamin and depends on the association state of the beta-subunit to the alpha1-pore-forming subunit. Our findings define a novel function for the beta-subunit through its\nrandom mutagenesis has identified residues in the transmembrane segments that are crucial for controlling the opening of Kir3.2 channels. The identification of structural elements involved in potassium channel gating in these systems highlights principles that may be important in the regulation of other types of channels. The Src homology 3 domain of the beta-subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels promotes endocytosis via dynamin interaction. High voltage-gated calcium channels enable calcium entry into cells in response to membrane depolarization. Association of the auxiliary beta-subunit to the alpha-interaction-domain in the pore-forming alpha1-subunit is required to form functional channels. The beta-subunit belongs to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase class of scaffolding proteins containing a Src homology 3 and a guanylate kinase domain. Although the latter is responsible for the high affinity binding to the alpha-interaction domain, the functional significance of the Src homology 3 domain remains elusive. Here, we show that injection of isolated beta-subunit\nKCNQ4 with MiRP2. This unique loss of voltage dependence is proposed to be crucial to the role of KCNQ1 in providing a K+ ion leak conductance in the colon by association with MiRP2 and stomach with MiRP1, in contrast to generating the voltage-dependent, slowly activating IKs repolarization current in the heart and inner ear with MinK, the founding member of the MiRP family. The propensity of KCNQ1 for conversion to leak mode by MiRP1 and MiRP2 poses several questions, three of which we address here: how can a channel with a voltage sensor lose voltage dependence; is the KCNQ1 activation gate uncoupled from S4 in leak channels; and why do MiRP1 and MiRP2 not convert any of their many other potassium channel partners to leak channels? MiRPs exhibit promiscuity of interaction; each can associate with a number of different \u03b1 subunit partners. Furthermore, each MiRP exerts a range of functional",

        "desc": "control pathways, respectively. Arginine and glutamate-rich 1 (ARGLU1) interacts with mediator subunit 1 (MED1) and is required for estrogen receptor-mediated gene transcription and breast cancer cell growth. Estrogen receptor is a nuclear receptor superfamily member of transcriptional activators that regulate gene expression by recruiting diverese transcriptional coregulators. The Mediator complex is a central transcriptional coactivator complex that acts as a bridge between transcriptional activators and RNA polymerase II. MED1 (Mediator subunit 1) is the key Mediator subunit that directly interacts with estrogen receptor to mediate its functions both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, our previous biochemical analyses indicated that MED1 exists only in a subpopulation of the Mediator complex that is enriched with a number of distinct Mediator subunits and RNA polymerase II. Here, we report ARGLU1 as a MED1/Mediator-associated protein. We found that ARGLU1 (arginine and glutamate rich 1) not only colocalizes with MED1 in the nucleus, but\ndifferent species. Because the arginine/lysine-rich motif was found to be responsible for Ipr1 nuclear localization and the importin protein receptor importin-\u03b15 (NPI-1) mediates protein translocation into the nuclei, we investigated the interaction between the Ipr1 mutants \u0394cNLS1/2 or \u0394cNLS1/2-R424A-K429A and NPI-1 (Fig 4C). Co-immunoprecipitation experiment results show that NPI-1 binds to Ipr1-\u0394cNLS1/2 mutant, but not to the \u0394cNLS1/2-R424A-K429A mutant, indicating that the Arg-424 and Lys-429 in the SAND domain contribute to the interaction between Ipr1 and NPI-1, thus mediating Ipr1 nuclear localization. The 3D configuration of the Ipr1 protein SAND domain was modeled using RASMOL, and the resulting space-filling representation is shown in Fig 4D. This partial structure of Ipr1 protein suggests the possibility that when two monomers move close to each other, the adjacent arginine/lysine-rich structural elements are exposed to the surface, thus providing the chance for recognition by the importin receptor protein. Additionally, the alignment of Ipr1 with\nbreast cancer cell growth. ARGLU1 is a transcriptional coactivator and splicing regulator important for stress hormone signaling and development. Stress hormones bind and activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in many tissues including the brain. We identified arginine and glutamate rich 1 (ARGLU1) in a screen for new modulators of glucocorticoid signaling in the CNS. Biochemical studies show that the glutamate rich C-terminus of ARGLU1 coactivates multiple nuclear receptors including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the arginine rich N-terminus interacts with splicing factors and binds to RNA. RNA-seq of neural cells depleted of ARGLU1 revealed significant changes in the expression and alternative splicing of distinct genes involved in neurogenesis. Loss of ARGLU1 is embryonic lethal in mice, and knockdown in zebrafish causes neurodevelopmental and heart defects. Treatment with dexamethasone, a GR activator, also induces changes in the pattern of alternatively spliced genes, many of which were lost when ARGLU1 was absent.\nand EBNALP dismisses NCoR and RBPJ repressive complexes from enhancers to coactivate hes1 and arglu1 but not cd21 or cd23. The Arginine/Lysine-Rich Element within the DNA-Binding Domain Is Essential for Nuclear Localization and Function of the Intracellular Pathogen Resistance 1 The mouse intracellular pathogen resistance 1 (Ipr1) gene plays important roles in mediating host immunity and previous work showed that it enhances macrophage apoptosis upon mycobacterium infection. However, to date, little is known about the regulation pattern of Ipr1 action. Recent studies have investigated the protein-coding genes and microRNAs regulated by Ipr1 in mouse macrophages, but the structure and the functional motif of the Ipr1 protein have yet to be explored. In this study, we analyzed the domains and functional motif of the Ipr1 protein. The resulting data reveal that Ipr1 protein forms a homodimer and that the Sp100-like domain mediates the targeting of Ipr1 protein to nuclear dots (NDs).\nMED1/Mediator-associated protein. We found that ARGLU1 (arginine and glutamate rich 1) not only colocalizes with MED1 in the nucleus, but also directly interacts with a far C-terminal region of MED1. Reporter assays indicate that ARGLU1 is able to cooperate with MED1 to regulate estrogen receptor-mediated gene transcription. Importantly, ARGLU1 is recruited, in a ligand-dependent manner, to endogenous estrogen receptor target gene promoters and is required for their expression. Furthermore, by ChIP-reChIP assay, we confirm that ARGLU1 and MED1 colocalize on the same estrogen receptor target gene promoter upon estrogen induction. Moreover, we found that depletion of ARGLU1 significantly impairs the growth, as well as anchorage-dependent and -independent colony formation of breast cancer cells. Taken together, these results establish ARGLU1 as a new MED1-interacting protein required for estrogen-dependent gene transcription and breast cancer cell growth. ARGLU1 is a transcriptional coactivator and splicing regulator important for stress hormone signaling and development. Stress\nkey glutamic acid, which is not present in Ydj1, forms a salt bridge with an arginine of the immediately adjacent glycine-rich region. Thus, restoration of Sis1 in vitro activity suggests that intramolecular interactions between the J-domain and glycine-rich region control co-chaperone activity, which is optimal only when Sis1 interacts with the EEVD(Hsp70) motif. However, we found that disruption of the Sis1:EEVD(Hsp70) interaction enhances the ability of Sis1 to substitute for Ydj1 in vivo. Our results are consistent with the idea that interaction of Sis1 with EEVD(Hsp70) minimizes transfer of Sis1-bound clients to Hsp70s that are primed for client transfer to folding and translocation pathways by their preassociation with EEVD binding adaptor proteins. These interactions may be one means by which cells triage Ydj1- and Sis1-bound clients to productive and quality control pathways, respectively. Arginine and glutamate-rich 1 (ARGLU1) interacts with mediator subunit 1 (MED1) and is required for estrogen receptor-mediated\nto the surface, thus providing the chance for recognition by the importin receptor protein. Additionally, the alignment of Ipr1 with its orthologous proteins in other species shows that a conserved arginine/lysine-rich structural element exists in the SAND domain, but the specific site varies following the evolution and relationships among species (Fig 4E and 4F). Collectively, these data indicate that an arginine/lysine-rich structural element in the SAND domain is required for Ipr1 nuclear localization, and this region is essential for the interaction between Ipr1 and the importin receptor protein NPI-1. Arg-424 and Lys-429 are critical for Ipr1 function Our recent study revealed that Ipr1 regulates the transcription of cytokines, chemokines, and genes involved in cell death and in the intracellular survival of Mtb. Because the Arg-424 and Lys-429 of Ipr1 that regulate its nuclear localization are very close to the Ipr1\u2013DNA interaction site, we tested whether or not these amino acids\nIpr1 protein forms a homodimer and that the Sp100-like domain mediates the targeting of Ipr1 protein to nuclear dots (NDs). Moreover, we found that an Ipr1 mutant lacking the classic nuclear localization signal (cNLS) also translocated into the nuclei, suggesting that the cNLS is not the only factor that directs Ipr1 nuclear localization. Additionally, mechanistic studies revealed that an arginine/lysine-rich element within the DNA-binding domain (SAND domain) is critical for Ipr1 binding to the importin protein receptor NPI-1, demonstrating that this element plays an essential role in mediating the nuclear localization of Ipr1 protein. Furthermore, our results show that this arginine/lysine-rich element contributes to the transcriptional regulation and apoptotic activity of Ipr1. These findings highlight the structural foundations of Ipr1 action and provide new insights into the mechanism of Ipr1-mediated resistance to mycobacterium.

EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) and EBV nuclear antigen LP (EBNALP) are critical for B-lymphocyte transformation to lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). EBNA2 activates transcription through recombination signal-binding immunoglobulin \u03baJ region (RBPJ), a transcription factor associated with NCoR repressive complexes, and EBNALP is implicated in repressor relocalization. EBNALP coactivation with EBNA2 was found to dominate over NCoR repression. EBNALP associated with NCoR and dismissed NCoR, NCoR and RBPJ, or NCoR, RBPJ, and EBNA2 from matrix-associated deacetylase (MAD) bodies. In non-EBV-infected BJAB B lymphoma cells that stably express EBNA2, EBNALP, or EBNA2 and EBNALP, EBNALP was associated with hairy and enhancer of split 1 (hes1), cd21, cd23, and arginine and glutamate-rich 1 (arglu1) enhancer or promoter DNA and was associated minimally with coding DNA. With the exception of RBPJ at the arglu1 enhancer,\nthe nucleus. Our data also demonstrate that the Arg-424 and Lys-429 in the Ipr1 SAND domain function as a conformational NLS, which is essential for the interaction between Ipr1 and NPI-1 that is needed to translocate Ipr1 into the nucleus. A dimer-specific NLS (ds-NLS) in STAT dimers has been mapped to the STAT DNA-binding domain, and it contains two basic amino acids separated by several residues (KXnKXnR) that are only functional when binding with NPI-1 following STAT dimerization. Ipr1 has an arginine/lysine-rich element, which is similar to that of STAT and also interacts with NPI-1. We found that the non-classic NLS in Ipr1 is partially responsible for its nuclear localization. Hence, we hypothesized that the dimer state of Ipr1 generates a new NLS that can translocate the dimer protein into the nuclei (Fig 6A). Further studies of Ipr1 mutants that lack the ability to form dimers are required to gain\nalignment aided by quality analysis tools Dimerization of resistin and resistin-like molecules is determined by a single cysteine Sp110 localizes to the PML-Sp100 nuclear body and may function as a nuclear hormone receptor transcriptional coactivator PSORT: a program for detecting sorting signals in proteins and predicting their subcellular localization Systematic identification of cell cycle-dependent yeast nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins by prediction of composite motifs Nucleocytoplasmic transport Nuclear localization signals overlap DNA- or RNA-binding domains in nucleic acid-binding proteins Extracellular signal-dependent nuclear import of Stat1 is mediated by nuclear pore-targeting complex formation with NPI-1, but not Rch1 Arginine/lysine-rich nuclear localization signals mediate interactions between dimeric STATs and importin alpha 5 RASMOL: biomolecular graphics for all MYBBP1A: a new Ipr1's binding protein in mice Sp110 transcription is induced and required by Anaplasma phagocytophilum for infection of human promyelocytic cells Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) SM protein induces and recruits cellular Sp110b to stabilize mRNAs and\nnonintegrin-binding arginine-glycine-glutamate (RGE) (Vtn(RGE/RGE)). We found that AECs cultured on fibronectin and vitronectin or in wild-type mouse serum are resistant to TGF-\u03b2-induced apoptosis. In contrast, AECs cultured on laminin or in serum from Vtn(-/-) or Vtn(RGE/RGE) mice undergo robust TGF-\u03b2-induced apoptosis. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) sensitizes AECs to greater apoptosis by disrupting AEC engagement to vitronectin. Inhibition of integrin-associated signaling proteins augments AEC apoptosis. Mice with transgenic deletion of PAI-1 have less apoptosis after bleomycin, but deletion of vitronectin or disruption of the vitronectin RGD motif reverses this protection, suggesting that the proapoptotic function of PAI-1 is mediated through vitronectin inhibition. Collectively, these data suggest that integrin-matrix signaling is an important regulator of TGF-\u03b2-mediated AEC apoptosis and that PAI-1 functions as a natural regulator of this interaction.

However, the detailed regulatory mechanism of how Ipr1 affects downstream genes remains unknown, and the relationship between the protein structure and function of Ipr1 has yet to be explored. In this study, we characterized the function of the Ipr1 protein domains by combining bioinformatics analyses and experimental studies. We found that the Sp100-like domain is responsible for dimerization and for the targeting of Ipr1 to nuclear dots (NDs). We also mapped two functional classic nuclear localization signals (cNLSs) and validated them by performing functional experiments; however, we found that these two cNLSs are dispensable for Ipr1 nuclear localization. Further studies revealed that a conserved arginine/lysine-rich structural element within the SAND domain not only contributes to Ipr1 nuclear localization as an unconventional nuclear localization signal (NLS), but is also essential for the regulatory effects of Ipr1 on its downstream target genes and signaling\nfactor by direct binding of importin-alpha The vitronectin RGD motif regulates TGF-\u03b2-induced alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) is a critical driver of acute lung injury and fibrosis. Injury leads to activation of TGF-\u03b2, which regulates changes in the cellular and matrix makeup of the lung during the repair and fibrosis phase. TGF-\u03b2 can also initiate alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) apoptosis. Injury leads to destruction of the laminin-rich basement membrane, which is replaced by a provisional matrix composed of arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) motif-containing plasma matrix proteins, including vitronectin and fibronectin. To determine the role of specific matrix proteins on TGF-\u03b2-induced apoptosis, we studied primary AECs cultured on different matrix conditions and utilized mice with deletion of vitronectin (Vtn(-/-)) or mice in which the vitronectin RGD motif is mutated to nonintegrin-binding arginine-glycine-glutamate (RGE) (Vtn(RGE/RGE)). We found that AECs cultured on fibronectin and vitronectin or in wild-type mouse serum are resistant\ninfection via modulating the expressions of a series of genes. To better understand the transcriptional regulation function of Ipr1, we analyzed and characterized its functional domains and their effects on Ipr1 dimerization, ND targeting, and nuclear localization. In addition to cNLSs, we found that an arginine/lysine-rich element in the SAND domain plays an essential role in regulating Ipr1 nuclear localization. Furthermore, we found that mutations in the Ipr1 Arg-424 and Lys-429 abolish the transcriptional regulation activity of Ipr1 and affect Ipr1-mediated apoptosis in Mtb-infected macrophages. The protein sequence and domains of Ipr1 are similar to those of the nuclear body proteins Sp100 and Sp140, suggesting an inherent correlation among these three proteins. It has been reported that Sp140 enhances the localization of Sp110 to the PML-Sp100 nuclear body. Our data provide evidence that Ipr1 can form a homodimer through the interaction of its Sp100-like domain, which is also responsible for\nHan population SP110 as a novel susceptibility gene for Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis infection in cattle The origin of polynucleotide phosphorylase domains The nuclear dot protein sp100, characterization of domains necessary for dimerization, subcellular localization, and modification by small ubiquitin-like modifiers The SAND domain structure defines a novel DNA-binding fold in transcriptional regulation Two new members of the emerging KDWK family of combinatorial transcription modulators bind as a heterodimer to flexibly spaced PuCGPy half-sites The autoimmune regulator protein has transcriptional transactivating properties and interacts with the common coactivator CREB-binding protein Characterization of a nuclear deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor-1 (DEAF-1)-related (NUDR) transcriptional regulator protein Interaction of SP100 with HP1 proteins: a link between the promyelocytic leukemia-associated nuclear bodies and the chromatin compartment The CLUSTAL_X windows interface: flexible strategies for multiple sequence alignment aided by quality analysis tools Dimerization of resistin and resistin-like molecules is determined by a single cysteine Sp110 localizes\nIpr1 mutants lacking both cNLSs, \u0394cNLS1/2 (Fig 4A). In NIH3T3 cells, the Ipr1 mutant with a deletion of aa435\u2013445 exhibited a similar subcellular localization to that of full-length Ipr1 (Fig 4B). Remarkably, mutants lacking aa424\u2013445 or aa391\u2013445 localized exclusively to the cytoplasm (Fig 4B), indicating that a non-classic NLS exists within the region between Ipr1 protein aa423 and aa435. This region consists of a cluster of basic amino acids near the KDWK motif that are conserved in Ipr1, Sp100, and Sp140 proteins (Fig 1B) and includes amino acids Arg-424 and Lys-429. To investigate the effect of Arg-424 and Lys-429 on Ipr1 nuclear localization, we generated EGFP-fused Ipr1 mutants containing mutations in both Arg-424 and Lys-429 (\u0394NLS1/2-R424A-K429A) (Fig 4A). The results reveal that mutations of Arg-424 and Lys-429 led to the cytoplasmic localization of Ipr1 (Fig 4B). Assessment of the Ipr1 arginine/lysine-rich element as a non-classical NLS of Ipr1.

The residue within amino acids 1-39 from the N-terminal end of the large subunit regulates DNA topology during relaxation by controlling noncovalent DNA binding or by coordinating DNA contacts by other parts of the enzyme. DNA topoisomerase I in oncology: Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde? Mammalian DNA topoisomerase I is a multifunctional enzyme which is essential for embryonal development. In addition to its classical DNA nicking-closing activities which are needed for relaxation of supercoiled DNA, topoisomerase I can phosphorylate certain splicing factors. The enzyme is also involved in transcriptional regulation through its ability to associate with other proteins in the TFIID-, and possibly TFIIH-, transcription complexes, and is implicated in the recognition of DNA lesions. Finally, topoisomerase I is a recombinase which can mediate illegitimate recombination. A crucial reaction intermediate during relaxation of DNA is the formation of a DNA-topoisomerase I complex (the cleavable\nN-terminal region of the large subunit of Leishmania donovani bisubunit topoisomerase I is involved in DNA relaxation and interaction with the smaller subunit. Leishmania donovani topoisomerase I is an unusual bisubunit enzyme. We have demonstrated earlier that the large and small subunit could be reconstituted in vitro to show topoisomerase I activity. We extend our biochemical study to evaluate the role of the large subunit in topoisomerase activity. The large subunit (LdTOP1L) shows a substantial degree of homology with the core DNA binding domain of the topoisomerase IB family. Two N-terminal truncation constructs, LdTOP1Delta39L (lacking amino acids 1-39) and LdTOP1Delta99L (lacking amino acids 1-99) of the large subunit were generated and mixed with intact small subunit (LdTOP1S). Our observations reveal that residues within amino acids 1-39 of the large subunit have significant roles in modulating topoisomerase I activity (i.e. in vitro DNA relaxation, camptothecin sensitivity, cleavage activity, and DNA binding\nhave significant roles in modulating topoisomerase I activity (i.e. in vitro DNA relaxation, camptothecin sensitivity, cleavage activity, and DNA binding affinity). Interestingly, the mutant LdTOP1Delta99LS was unable to show topoisomerase I activity. Investigation of the loss of activity indicates that LdTOP1Delta99L was unable to pull down glutathione S-transferase-LdTOP1S in an Ni(2+)-nitrilotriacetic acid co-immobilization experiment. For further analysis, we co-expressed LdTOP1L and LdTOP1S in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. The lysate shows topoisomerase I activity. Immunoprecipitation revealed that LdTOP1L could interact with LdTOP1S, indicating the subunit interaction in bacterial cells, whereas immunoprecipitation of bacterial lysate co-expressing LdTOP1Delta99L and LdTOP1S reveals that LdTOP1Delta99L was significantly deficient at interacting with LdTOP1S to reconstitute topoisomerase I activity. This study demonstrates that heterodimerization between the large and small subunits of the bisubunit enzyme appears to be an absolute requirement for topoisomerase activity. The residue within amino acids 1-39 from the N-terminal end of the large subunit\nthe cleavable complexes through physical interaction with the oncogene suppressor protein p53 and by degradation of the topoisomerase I by the proteasome system. Emerging evidence suggest that these regulatory functions are perturbed in tumor cells, explaining at the same time why topoisomerase I activities so often are increased in certain human tumors, and why these cells are sensitized to the cytotoxic effects of camptothecins. C-terminal lysine repeats in Streptomyces topoisomerase I stabilize the enzyme-DNA complex and confer high enzyme processivity. Streptomyces topoisomerase I (TopA) exhibits exceptionally high processivity. The enzyme, as other actinobacterial topoisomerases I, differs from its bacterial homologs in its C-terminal domain (CTD). Here, bioinformatics analyses established that the presence of lysine repeats is a characteristic feature of actinobacterial TopA CTDs. Streptomyces TopA contains the longest stretch of lysine repeats, which terminate with acidic amino acids. DNA-binding studies revealed that the lysine repeats stabilized the TopA-DNA complex, while\nillegitimate recombination. A crucial reaction intermediate during relaxation of DNA is the formation of a DNA-topoisomerase I complex (the cleavable complex) where topoisomerase I is covalently linked to a 3 -end of DNA thereby creating a single stranded DNA break. Cleavable complexes are also formed in the vicinity of DNA lesions and in the presence of the antitumor agent, camptothecin. While formation of cleavable complexes may be necessary for the initial stages of the DNA damage response, these complexes are also potentially dangerous to the cell due to their ability to mediate illegitimate recombination, which can lead to genomic instability and oncogenesis. Thus the levels and stability of these complexes have to be strictly regulated. This is obtained by maintaining the enzyme levels relatively constant, by limiting the stability of the cleavable complexes through physical interaction with the oncogene suppressor protein p53 and by degradation of the topoisomerase I by\nlysine repeats, which terminate with acidic amino acids. DNA-binding studies revealed that the lysine repeats stabilized the TopA-DNA complex, while single-molecule experiments showed that their elimination impaired enzyme processivity. Streptomyces coelicolor TopA processivity could not be restored by fusion of its N-terminal domain (NTD) with the Escherichia coli TopA CTD. The hybrid protein could not re-establish the distribution of multiple chromosomal copies in Streptomyces hyphae impaired by TopA depletion. We expected that the highest TopA processivity would be required during the growth of multigenomic sporogenic hyphae, and indeed, the elimination of lysine repeats from TopA disturbed sporulation. We speculate that the interaction of the lysine repeats with DNA allows the stabilization of the enzyme-DNA complex, which is additionally enhanced by acidic C-terminal amino acids. The complex stabilization, which may be particularly important for GC-rich chromosomes, enables high enzyme processivity.

TOPAS-nBio: An Extension to the TOPAS Simulation Toolkit for Cellular and Sub-cellular Radiobiology. The TOPAS Monte Carlo (MC) system is used in radiation therapy and medical imaging research, having played a significant role in making Monte Carlo simulations widely available for proton therapy related research. While TOPAS provides detailed simulations of patient scale properties, the fundamental unit of the biological response to radiation is a cell. Thus, our goal was to develop TOPAS-nBio, an extension of TOPAS dedicated to advance understanding of radiobiological effects at the (sub-)cellular, (i.e., the cellular and sub-cellular) scale. TOPAS-nBio was designed as a set of open source classes that extends TOPAS to model radiobiological experiments. TOPAS-nBio is based on and extends Geant4-DNA, which extends the Geant4 toolkit, the basis of\nthe chemical reactions and species provided in Geant4-DNA and developed a new method based on independent reaction times (IRT), including a total of 72 reactions classified into 6 types between neutral and charged species. Chemical stage simulations using IRT were a factor of 145 faster than with step-by-step tracking. Finally, we applied the geometric/chemical modeling to obtain initial yields of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA fibers for proton irradiations of 3 and 50 MeV and compared the effect of including chemical reactions on the number and complexity of DSB induction. Over half of the DSBs were found to include chemical reactions with approximately 5% of DSBs caused only by chemical reactions. In conclusion, the TOPAS-nBio extension to the TOPAS MC application offers access to accurate and detailed multiscale simulations, from a macroscopic description of the radiation field to microscopic description of biological outcome for selected cells. TOPAS-nBio offers detailed physics\nTOPAS to model radiobiological experiments. TOPAS-nBio is based on and extends Geant4-DNA, which extends the Geant4 toolkit, the basis of TOPAS, to include very low-energy interactions of particles down to vibrational energies, explicitly simulates every particle interaction (i.e., without using condensed histories) and propagates radiolysis products. To further facilitate the use of TOPAS-nBio, a graphical user interface was developed. TOPAS-nBio offers full track-structure Monte Carlo simulations, integration of chemical reactions within the first millisecond, an extensive catalogue of specialized cell geometries as well as sub-cellular structures such as DNA and mitochondria, and interfaces to mechanistic models of DNA repair kinetics. We compared TOPAS-nBio simulations to measured and published data of energy deposition patterns and chemical reaction rates (G values). Our simulations agreed well within the experimental uncertainties. Additionally, we expanded the chemical reactions and species provided in Geant4-DNA and developed a new method based on independent reaction times (IRT), including\na macroscopic description of the radiation field to microscopic description of biological outcome for selected cells. TOPAS-nBio offers detailed physics and chemistry simulations of radiobiological experiments on cells simulating the initially induced damage and links to models of DNA repair kinetics.",

A double-point mutation in the selectivity filter site of the KCNQ1 potassium channel results in a severe phenotype, LQT1, of long QT syndrome. INTRODUCTION: Slowly activating delayed-rectifier potassium currents in the heart are produced by a complex protein with alpha and beta subunits composed of the potassium voltage-gated channel KQT-like subfamily, member 1 (KCNQ1) and the potassium voltage-gated channel Isk-related family, member 1 (KCNE1), respectively. Mutations in KCNQ1 underlie the most common type of hereditary long QT syndrome (LQTS). Like other potassium channels, KCNQ1 has six transmembrane domains and a highly conserved potassium selectivity filter in the pore helix called \"the signature sequence.\" We aimed to investigate the functional consequences of a newly identified mutation within the signature sequence.METHODS AND RESULTS: Potassium channel genomic DNA from a family with clinical evidence of LQTS was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the resulting products were\npotassium channels that regulate electric pores. Subsequent animal studies revealed the developmental functions of Kcnb1-containing voltage-gated potassium channels and illustrated their role during brain development and reproduction. These functions of potassium channels are discussed in this review in the context of regulatory interactions between electrically-active and regulatory subunits. Functional characterization of Kv channel beta-subunits from rat brain. 1. The potassium channel beta-subunit from rat brain, Kv beta 1.1, is known to induce inactivation of the delayed rectifier channel Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 delta 1-110. 2. Kv beta 1.1 was co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes with various other potassium channel alpha-subunits. Kv beta 1.1 induced inactivation in members of the Kv1 subfamily with the exception of Kv 1.6; no inactivation of Kv 2.1, Kv 3.4 delta 2-28 and Kv4.1 channels could be observed. 3. The second member of the beta-subunit subfamily, Kv beta 2, had a shorter N-terminal end, accelerated inactivation of the\nthe presence of HpTx2. Both models feature a series of voltage-dependent steps leading to a final voltage-independent transition to the open state and closely replicate the experimental data. Interaction with HpTx2 increases the energy barrier for channel opening by slowing activation and accelerating deactivation. The greater degree of voltage-dependence in Kv4.3 occurs because it is the voltage-dependent transitions that are most affected by HpTx2; in contrast, it is the voltage-independent step in Kv4.1 that is most affected by the presence of toxin. These data demonstrate the basis for subtype-specificity of HpTx2 and point the way to a general model of gating modifier toxin interaction with voltage-gated ion channels. V374A KCND3 Pathogenic Variant Associated With Paroxysmal Ataxia Exacerbations. OBJECTIVE: Ataxia channelopathies share common features such as slow motor progression and variable degrees of cognitive dysfunction. Mutations in potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily D member 3 (KCND3), encoding the K+ channel, Kv4.3, are\ndegrees of cognitive dysfunction. Mutations in potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily D member 3 (KCND3), encoding the K+ channel, Kv4.3, are associated with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 19, allelic with SCA22. Mutations in potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily C member 3 (KCNC3), encoding another K+ channel, Kv3.3, cause SCA13. First, a comprehensive phenotype assessment was carried out in a family with autosomal dominant ataxia harboring 2 genetic variants in KCNC3 and KCND3. To evaluate the physiological impact of these variants on channel currents, in vitro studies were performed.METHODS: Clinical and psychometric evaluations, neuroimaging, and genotyping of a family (mother and son) affected by ataxia were carried out. Heterozygous and homozygous Kv3.3 A671V and Kv4.3 V374A variants were evaluated in Xenopus laevis oocytes using 2-electrode voltage-clamp. The influence of Kv4 conductance on neuronal activity was investigated computationally using a Purkinje neuron model.RESULTS: The main clinical findings were consistent with adult-onset ataxia with cognitive dysfunction\nfunctional analyses demonstrate that I262T changes the voltage-dependent activation and Kv\u03b21.1-mediated inactivation, uncouples inactivation from activation gating, and decelerates the kinetics of cumulative inactivation of Kv1.1 channels. I262T also exerts similar dominant effects on the gating of Kv1.2 and Kv1.4 channels. Together our data suggest that I262T confers altered channel gating and reduced functional expression of Kv1 channels, which may account for some of the phenotypes of the EA1 patient. Structural and functional characterization of Kv6.2 a new gamma-subunit of voltage-gated potassium channel. We have cloned and functionally expressed Kv6.2, a new member of the Kv6 subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channel subunits. The human Kv6.2 (KCNF2) gene was mapped at 18q22-18q23. Kv6.2 mRNA is preferentially expressed in rat and human myocard. Rat and human Kv6.2 subunits appear to be unable to form functional Kv channels in a heterologous expression system, but, when coexpressed with Kv2.1 alpha subunits, heteromultimeric Kv channels\nresults in a dominant-negative loss of channel function, leading to a long QT interval and subsequent syncope. Kv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels in developmental perspective. Kv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels consist of two types of \u03b1-subunits: (a) electrically-active Kcnb1 \u03b1-subunits and (b) silent or modulatory \u03b1-subunits plus \u03b2-subunits that, similar to silent \u03b1-subunits, also regulate electrically-active subunits. Voltage-gated potassium channels were traditionally viewed, mainly by electrophysiologists, as regulators of the electrical activity of the plasma membrane in excitable cells, a role that is performed by transmembrane protein domains of \u03b1-subunits that form the electric pore. Genetic studies revealed a role for this region of \u03b1-subunits of voltage-gated potassium channels in human neurodevelopmental disorders, such as epileptic encephalopathy. The N- and C-terminal domains of \u03b1-subunits interact to form the cytoplasmic subunit of heterotetrameric potassium channels that regulate electric pores. Subsequent animal studies revealed the developmental functions of Kcnb1-containing voltage-gated potassium channels and illustrated\nprepulse inactivation curve (>10 mV), respectively. By contrast, the analogous mutations (V[556,558]I) in a K+ channel that undergoes N- and C-type inactivation (Kv1.4) did not affect macroscopic inactivation but dramatically slowed deactivation and recovery from inactivation, and eliminated open-channel blockade by 4-AP. Mutation of a Kv4-specific residue in the S4-S5 loop (C322S) of Kv4.1 also altered gating and 4-AP sensitivity in a manner that closely resembles the effects of V[404, 406]I. However, this mutant did not exhibit disrupted closed state inactivation. A kinetic model that assumes coupling between channel closing and inactivation at depolarized membrane potentials accounts for the results. We propose that components of the pore's internal vestibule control both closing and inactivation in Kv4 K+ channels. The episodic ataxia type 1 mutation I262T alters voltage-dependent gating and disrupts protein biosynthesis of human Kv1.1 potassium channels. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels are essential for setting neuronal membrane excitability. Mutations in\nto form functional Kv channels in a heterologous expression system, but, when coexpressed with Kv2.1 alpha subunits, heteromultimeric Kv channels were formed mediating voltage-activated delayed-rectifier type outward currents. Their kinetics and conductance-voltage relationship were different from those mediated by homomultimeric Kv2.1 channels. Yeast two-hybrid reporter assays indicated that Kv6.2 amino-termini are able to interact specifically with the Kv2.1 amino-terminus. It is proposed that this protein protein interaction underlies Kv2.1/Kv6.2 subunit assembly and the expression of functional heteromultimeric Kv2.1/Kv6.2 channels. The most resiliant feature of the Kv2.1/Kv6.2 channels was their submicromolar sensitivity to the antiarrhythmic drug propafenone. The data suggest that delayed-rectifier type channels containing Kv6.2 subunits may contribute to cardiac action potential repolarization. Expression and distribution of Kv4 potassium channel subunits and potassium channel interacting proteins in subpopulations of interneurons in the basolateral amygdala. The Kv4 potassium channel \u03b1 subunits, Kv4.1, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3, determine some of the fundamental physiological\nIle, Val, or Glu increased the IC50 value by >34-fold. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis experiments indicated that the functional surface of JZTX-III bound to the Kv2.1 channel is composed of four hydrophobic residues (Trp8, Trp28, Trp30, and Val33) and three charged residues (Arg13, Lys15, and Glu34). The bioactive surfaces of JZTX-III interacting with Kv2.1 and Nav1.5 are only partially overlapping. These results strongly supported the hypothesis that animal toxins might use partially overlapping bioactive surfaces to target the voltage-sensor paddles of two different types of ion channels. Increasing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of toxins interacting with voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels may provide new molecular insights into the design of more potent ion channel inhibitors. Voltage-dependent Gating Rearrangements in the Intracellular T1\u2013T1 Interface of a K+ Channel The intracellular tetramerization domain (T1) of most eukaryotic voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv channels) exists as a \u201changing gondola\u201d below the transmembrane regions that\nY74 and S104-I106 domains can be largely accounted for by a relative destabilization of channels in open states that have few voltage sensors activated. These results suggest a unique and novel mechanism for \u03b2 subunit modulation of voltage-gated potassium channels wherein interactions between extracellular \u03b2 subunit residues with the external portions of the gate and voltage sensor regulate channel opening.\nthe G protein betagamma subunits, thereby mediating slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in the brain. Our structure-based functional analysis on the cytoplasmic N-terminal tetramerization domain T1 of the voltage-gated channel, Kv1.2, uncovered a new function for this domain, modulation of voltage gating, and suggested a possible means of communication between second messenger pathways and Kv channels. A yeast screen for active Kir3.2 channels subjected to random mutagenesis has identified residues in the transmembrane segments that are crucial for controlling the opening of Kir3.2 channels. The identification of structural elements involved in potassium channel gating in these systems highlights principles that may be important in the regulation of other types of channels. Heteropoda toxin 2 interaction with Kv4.3 and Kv4.1 reveals differences in gating modification. Kv4 (Shal) potassium channels are responsible for the transient outward K(+) currents in mammalian hearts and central nervous systems. Heteropoda toxin 2 (HpTx2) is an inhibitor cysteine\nbinding. Impact of ancillary subunits on ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels generate the outward K(+) ion currents that constitute the primary force in ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium channels comprise tetramers of pore-forming alpha subunits and, in probably most cases in vivo, ancillary or beta subunits that help define the properties of the Kv current generated. Ancillary subunits can be broadly categorized as cytoplasmic or transmembrane and can modify Kv channel trafficking, conductance, gating, ion selectivity, regulation, and pharmacology. Because of their often profound effects on Kv channel function, studies of the molecular correlates of ventricular repolarization must take into account ancillary subunits as well as alpha subunits. Cytoplasmic ancillary subunits include the Kv beta subunits, which regulate a range of Kv channels and may link channel gating to redox potential, and the KChIPs, which appear most often associated with Kv4 subfamily channels that generate the ventricular I(to) current. Transmembrane\ndomain (T1) of most eukaryotic voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv channels) exists as a \u201changing gondola\u201d below the transmembrane regions that directly control activation gating via the electromechanical coupling between the S4 voltage sensor and the main S6 gate. However, much less is known about the putative contribution of the T1 domain to Kv channel gating. This possibility is mechanistically intriguing because the T1\u2013S1 linker connects the T1 domain to the voltage-sensing domain. Previously, we demonstrated that thiol-specific reagents inhibit Kv4.1 channels by reacting in a state-dependent manner with native Zn2+ site thiolate groups in the T1\u2013T1 interface; therefore, we concluded that the T1\u2013T1 interface is functionally active and not protected by Zn2+ (Wang, G., M. Shahidullah, C.A. Rocha, C. Strang, P.J. Pfaffinger, and M. Covarrubias. 2005. J. Gen. Physiol. 126:55\u201369). Here, we co-expressed Kv4.1 channels and auxiliary subunits (KChIP-1 and DPPX-S) to investigate the state and voltage dependence of the\njingzhao, is specific for Nav1.5 and Kv2.1 channels over the majority of other ion channel subtypes. JZTX-III traps the Nav1.5 DII voltage sensor at closed state by binding to the DIIS3-S4 linker. In this study, electrophysiological experiments showed that JZTX-III had no effect on five voltage-gated potassium channel subtypes (Kv1.4, Kv3.1, and Kv4.1-4.3), whereas it significantly inhibited Kv2.1 with an IC50 of 0.71 \u00b1 0.01 \u03bcM. Mutagenesis and modeling data suggested that JZTX-III docks at the Kv2.1 voltage-sensor paddle. Alanine replacement of Phe274, Lys280, Ser281, Leu283, Gln284, and Val288 could decrease JZTX-III affinity by 7-, 9-, 34-, 12-, 9-, and 7-fold, respectively. Among them, S281 is the most crucial determinant, and the substitution with Thr only slightly reduced toxin sensitivity. In contrast, a single conversion of Ser281 to Ala, Phe, Ile, Val, or Glu increased the IC50 value by >34-fold. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis experiments indicated that the functional surface of JZTX-III\nin excitable tissues. Supplemental Material Molecular studies of voltage-gated potassium channels. The cloning and characterization of the voltage-activated Shaker potassium channel gene in Drosophila have led to the identification of structural elements involved in potassium channel gating. As found for the voltage-activated sodium channel, the S4 segment, located in the conserved core of the protein, plays a central role in voltage-dependent activation. Potassium channels appear to be formed by the assembly of several polypeptides into multisubunit channels. This is directly analogous to the proposed folding of the four internally homologous pseudosubunits of sodium and calcium channels. The amino- and carboxy-terminal regions of Shaker channels are specialized for, and appear to interact in, inactivation gating. This interaction probably includes interaction between subunits, as may be said for the role in inactivation gating of the junction between the carboxyl terminus of the third domain and amino terminus of the fourth domain of\nand the rapid access of K+ and the intracellular inactivation gate to the internal mouth of the Kv pore. This hypothetical expansion is reasonable because the lateral intracellular portals are clearly apparent between the membrane-spanning core and the T1 domain in the recently published crystal structure of a mammalian Kv channel in the open state. Conclusion We have provided compelling evidence for tight coupling between voltage-dependent activation of a Kv4 channel and conformational changes involving the intracellular T1\u2013T1 interface. We propose that the complex structural rearrangements that control fast and efficient activation gating of eukaryotic Kv channels include propagated movements in the conserved L4 layer of the T1 domain and a post-S6 COOH-terminal segment that may contact the T1\u2013T1 interface. These findings suggest novel ways to regulate Kv channel gating in excitable tissues. Supplemental Material Molecular studies of voltage-gated potassium channels. The cloning and characterization of the voltage-activated Shaker potassium\nprotein biosynthesis of human Kv1.1 potassium channels. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels are essential for setting neuronal membrane excitability. Mutations in human Kv1.1 channels are linked to episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1). The EA1-associated mutation I262T was identified from a patient with atypical phenotypes. Although a previous report has characterized its suppression effect, several key questions regarding the impact of the I262T mutation on Kv1.1 as well as other members of the Kv1 subfamily remain unanswered. Herein we show that the dominant-negative effect of I262T on Kv1.1 current expression is not reversed by co-expression with Kv\u03b21.1 or Kv\u03b22 subunits. Biochemical examinations indicate that I262T displays enhanced protein degradation and impedes membrane trafficking of Kv1.1 wild-type subunits. I262T appears to be the first EA1 mutation directly associated with impaired protein stability. Further functional analyses demonstrate that I262T changes the voltage-dependent activation and Kv\u03b21.1-mediated inactivation, uncouples inactivation from activation gating, and decelerates the\ngating of the junction between the carboxyl terminus of the third domain and amino terminus of the fourth domain of sodium channel (Vassilev et al. 1988). The capacity for coassembly in potassium channels extends not only to the alternatively spliced products of the same gene, but also to the products of different genes. Heteromultimeric channels that are formed in this way have kinetic and pharmacological properties that differ from homomultimers of their constituents and, as such, broaden the functional diversity of channels that can be produced by any given number of compatible potassium channel genes. An extracellular domain of the accessory \u03b21 subunit is required for modulating BK channel voltage sensor and gate. A family of tissue-specific auxiliary \u03b2 subunits modulates large conductance voltage- and calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel gating properties to suit their diverse functions. Paradoxically, \u03b2 subunits both promote BK channel activation through a stabilization of voltage sensor\nfrom a family with clinical evidence of LQTS was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the resulting products were then sequenced. Three family members had a double-point mutation in KCNQ1 at nucleotides 938 (T-to-A) and 939 (C-to-A), resulting in an isoleucine-to-lysine change at amino acid position 313. These patients displayed prolonged QTc intervals (629, 508, and 500 ms(1/2,) respectively) and repetitive episodes of syncope, but no deafness. Three-dimensional structure modeling of KCNQ1 revealed that this mutation is located at the center of the channel pore. COS-7 cells displayed a lack of current when transfected with a plasmid expressing the mutant. In addition, the mutant displayed a dominant negative effect on current but appeared normal with respect to plasma membrane integration.CONCLUSION: An I313K mutation within the selectivity filter of KCNQ1 results in a dominant-negative loss of channel function, leading to a long QT interval and subsequent syncope. Kv2.1 voltage-gated potassium\ncell membrane translocation of the Kv4.3 V374A variant, thus suggesting an impairment of channel function, rather than of expression. Computational modeling predicted an increased Purkinje neuron firing frequency upon reduced Kv4.3 conductance.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that Kv4.3 V374A is likely pathogenic and associated with paroxysmal ataxia exacerbations, a new trait for SCA19/22. The present FDG PET findings contrast with a previous study demonstrating widespread brain hypometabolism in SCA19/22. Analysis of the interaction of tarantula toxin Jingzhaotoxin-III (\u03b2-TRTX-Cj1\u03b1) with the voltage sensor of Kv2.1 uncovers the molecular basis for cross-activities on Kv2.1 and Nav1.5 channels. Animal venoms contain a fascinating array of divergent peptide toxins that have cross-activities on different types of voltage-gated ion channels. However, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Jingzhaotoxin-III (JZTX-III), a 36-residue peptide from the tarantula Chilobrachys jingzhao, is specific for Nav1.5 and Kv2.1 channels over the majority of other ion channel subtypes. JZTX-III traps the Nav1.5",

        "desc": "Differential modulation of Beta-adrenergic receptor signaling by trace amine-associated receptor 1 agonists. Trace amine-associated receptors (TAAR) are rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). TAAR are involved in modulation of neuronal, cardiac and vascular functions and they are potentially linked with neurological disorders like schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Subtype TAAR1, the best characterized TAAR so far, is promiscuous for a wide set of ligands and is activated by trace amines tyramine (TYR), phenylethylamine (PEA), octopamine (OA), but also by thyronamines, dopamine, and psycho-active drugs. Unfortunately, effects of trace amines on signaling of the two homologous \u03b2-adrenergic receptors 1 (ADRB1) and 2 (ADRB2) have not been clarified yet in detail. We, therefore, tested TAAR1 agonists TYR, PEA and OA regarding their effects on ADRB1/2 signaling by co-stimulation studies. Surprisingly, trace amines TYR and PEA are partial allosteric antagonists at ADRB1/2, whereas OA is a partial orthosteric ADRB2-antagonist and ADRB1-agonist. To specify molecular reasons for\nare partial allosteric antagonists at ADRB1/2, whereas OA is a partial orthosteric ADRB2-antagonist and ADRB1-agonist. To specify molecular reasons for TAAR1 ligand promiscuity and for observed differences in signaling effects on particular aminergic receptors we compared TAAR, tyramine (TAR) octopamine (OAR), ADRB1/2 and dopamine receptors at the structural level. We found especially for TAAR1 that the remarkable ligand promiscuity is likely based on high amino acid similarity in the ligand-binding region compared with further aminergic receptors. On the other hand few TAAR specific properties in the ligand-binding site might determine differences in ligand-induced effects compared to ADRB1/2. Taken together, this study points to molecular details of TAAR1-ligand promiscuity and identified specific trace amines as allosteric or orthosteric ligands of particular \u03b2-adrenergic receptor subtypes. Agonists for 13 trace amine-associated receptors provide insight into the molecular basis of odor selectivity. Trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) are vertebrate olfactory receptors. However, ligand recognition properties\ninsight into the molecular basis of odor selectivity. Trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) are vertebrate olfactory receptors. However, ligand recognition properties of TAARs remain poorly understood, as most are \"orphan receptors\" without known agonists. Here, we identify the first ligands for many rodent TAARs and classify these receptors into two subfamilies based on the phylogeny and binding preference for primary or tertiary amines. Some mouse and rat orthologs have similar response profiles, although independent Taar7 gene expansions led to highly related receptors with altered ligand specificities. Using chimeric TAAR7 receptors, we identified an odor contact site in transmembrane helix III that functions as a selectivity filter. Homology models based on the \u03b2(2) adrenergic receptor structure indicate spatial proximity of this site to the ligand. Gain-of-function mutations at this site created olfactory receptors with radically altered odor recognition properties. These studies provide new TAAR ligands, valuable tools for studying receptor function, and\nreceptors with radically altered odor recognition properties. These studies provide new TAAR ligands, valuable tools for studying receptor function, and general insights into the molecular pharmacology of G protein-coupled receptors.",

Despite the critical role of MreB-like proteins, we lack mechanistic insight into how their activities are regulated. Here, we describe the discovery of two B. subtilis proteins, YodL and YisK, which modulate MreB and Mbl activities. Our data suggest that YodL specifically targets MreB, whereas YisK targets Mbl. The apparent specificities with which YodL and YisK are able to differentially target MreB and Mbl make them potentially powerful tools for probing the mechanics of cytoskeletal function in bacteria. Subunit gamma of the oxaloacetate decarboxylase Na(+) pump: interaction with other subunits/domains of the complex and binding site for the Zn(2+) metal ion. The oxaloacetate decarboxylase Na(+) pump of Klebsiella pneumoniae is an enzyme complex composed of the peripheral alpha subunit and the two integral membrane-bound subunits beta and gamma. The alpha subunit consists of the N-terminal\nthe C-terminal biotin domain but not the N-terminal carboxyltransferase domain of the alpha subunit formed a strong complex with the gamma subunit. Upon the mutation of gamma H78 to alanine, the binding affinity to subunit alpha was lost, indicating that this amino acid may be essential for formation of the oxaloacetate decarboxylase enzyme complex. The binding residues for the Zn(2+) metal ion were identified by site-directed and deletion mutagenesis. In the gamma D62A or gamma H77A mutant, the Zn(2+) content of the decarboxylase decreased to 35% or 10% of the wild-type enzyme, respectively. Less than 5% of the Zn(2+) present in the wild-type enzyme was found if the two C-terminal gamma-subunit residues H82 and P83 were deleted. Corresponding with the reduced Zn(2+) contents in these mutants, the oxaloacetate decarboxylase activities were diminished. These results indicate that aspartate 62, histidine 77, and histidine 82 of the gamma subunit are ligands for\nwere diminished. These results indicate that aspartate 62, histidine 77, and histidine 82 of the gamma subunit are ligands for the catalytically important Zn(2+) metal ion. Synthesis of the oxaloacetate decarboxylase Na+ pump and its individual subunits in Escherichia coli and analysis of their function. The oadGAB genes encoding the gamma, alpha and beta-subunits of the oxaloacetate decarboxylase Na+ pump in Klebsiella pneumoniae have been cloned on plasmid pSK-GAB and expressed in Escherichia coli. The membranes of the recombinant E. coli clone contained about three times as much catalytically active oxaloacetate decarboxylase (3 mg protein/2 g wet cells) as those of the K. pneumoniae strain from which the genes were derived. The enzyme was solubilised from the membranes with Triton X-100 and purified. Its Na+ transport function was demonstrated after reconstitution into proteoliposomes. Proteoliposomes containing only the membrane-bound subunits beta and gamma (not the peripheral alpha-subunit) were unable to catalyse\nMbl. YisK belongs to the fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) superfamily, and crystal structures revealed close structural similarity to two oxaloacetate (OAA) decarboxylases: human mitochondrial FAHD1 and Corynebacterium glutamicum Cg1458. We demonstrate that YisK can also catalyze the decarboxylation of OAA (K m = 134 \u00b5M, K cat = 31 min-1). A catalytic dead variant (YisK E148A, E150A) retains wild-type localization and still widens cells following overexpression, indicating these activities are not dependent on YisK catalysis. Conversely, a non-localizing variant (YisK E30A) retains wild-type enzymatic activity in vitro but localizes diffusely and no longer widens cells following overexpression. Together, these results suggest that YisK may be subject to spatial regulation that depends on the cell envelope synthesis machinery. IMPORTANCE The elongasome is a multiprotein complex that guides lengthwise growth in some bacteria. We previously showed that, in B. subtilis, overexpression of an uncharacterized putative enzyme (YisK) perturbed function of the actin-like elongasome\nSalmonella typhimurium OAD \u03b2\u03b3 sub-complex. The structure revealed that the \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits form a \u03b23\u03b33 hetero-hexamer with extensive interactions between the subunits and shed light on the OAD holo-enzyme assembly. Structure-guided functional studies provided insights into the sodium binding sites in the \u03b2 subunit and the coupling between carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation and sodium transport by the OAD \u03b2 subunit. Bacillus subtilis YisK possesses oxaloacetate decarboxylase activity and exhibits Mbl-dependent localization. YisK is an uncharacterized protein in Bacillus subtilis previously shown to interact genetically with the elongasome protein Mbl. YisK overexpression leads to cell widening and lysis, phenotypes that are dependent on mbl and suppressed by mbl mutations. In the present work, we characterize YisK's localization, structure, and enzymatic activity. We show that YisK localizes as puncta that depend on Mbl. YisK belongs to the fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) superfamily, and crystal structures revealed close structural similarity to two oxaloacetate (OAA)\nWe previously showed that, in B. subtilis, overexpression of an uncharacterized putative enzyme (YisK) perturbed function of the actin-like elongasome protein Mbl. Here, we show that YisK exhibits Mbl-dependent localization. Through biochemical and structural characterization, we demonstrate that, like its mitochondrial homolog FAHD1, YisK can catalyze the decarboxylation of the oxaloacetate to pyruvate and CO2. YisK is the first example of an enzyme implicated in central carbon metabolism with subcellular localization that depends on Mbl.\nCO2 transfer to the biotin on the alpha-subunit was about three orders of magnitude too low to account for the rate of the overall reaction. The carboxyltransfer reaction was significantly accelerated if the gamma-subunit was additionally present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) Structural insights into sodium transport by the oxaloacetate decarboxylase sodium pump. The oxaloacetate decarboxylase sodium pump (OAD) is a unique primary-active transporter that utilizes the free energy derived from oxaloacetate decarboxylation for sodium transport across the cell membrane. It is composed of 3 subunits: the \u03b1 subunit catalyzes carboxyl-transfer from oxaloacetate to biotin, the membrane integrated \u03b2 subunit catalyzes the subsequent carboxyl-biotin decarboxylation and the coupled sodium transport, the \u03b3 subunit interacts with the \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits and stabilizes the OAD complex. We present here structure of the Salmonella typhimurium OAD \u03b2\u03b3 sub-complex. The structure revealed that the \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits form a \u03b23\u03b33 hetero-hexamer with extensive\nreconstitution into proteoliposomes. Proteoliposomes containing only the membrane-bound subunits beta and gamma (not the peripheral alpha-subunit) were unable to catalyse Na+ translocation in response to a transmembrane Na+ (delta pNa+) or electrical gradient (delta psi). Individual subunits of oxaloacetate decarboxylase and combinations of two subunits were expressed from appropriate derivatives of plasmid pSK-GAB. The hydrophobic subunits beta and beta gamma were membrane-bound as expected. Interestingly, the alpha-subunit was located in the cytoplasm if expressed separately or together with beta, but became membrane-bound if expressed together with gamma. A gamma alpha complex was isolated from such membranes by avidin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Interactions of the gamma-subunit with the water-soluble alpha-subunit and with the membrane-bound beta-subunit are therefore required to form the oxaloacetate decarboxylase complex. The combinations of separately expressed subunits gamma alpha + beta and beta gamma+alpha were shown to yield the catalytically active enzyme. The alpha or the beta-subunit and the\nthe peripheral alpha subunit and the two integral membrane-bound subunits beta and gamma. The alpha subunit consists of the N-terminal carboxyltransferase domain and the C-terminal biotin domain, which are connected by a flexible proline/alanine-rich linker peptide. To probe interactions between the two domains of the alpha subunit and between alpha-subunit domains and the gamma subunit, the relevant polypeptides were synthesized in Escherichia coli and subjected to copurification studies. The two alpha-subunit domains had no distinct affinity toward each other and could, therefore, not be purified as a unit on avidin-sepharose. The two domains reacted together catalytically, however, performing the carboxyl transfer from oxaloacetate to protein-bound biotin. This reaction was enhanced up to 6-fold in the presence of the Zn(2+)-containing gamma subunit. On the basis of copurification with different tagged proteins, the C-terminal biotin domain but not the N-terminal carboxyltransferase domain of the alpha subunit formed a strong complex with the\nactivity occurred primarily in mreB mutants and resulted in amino acid substitutions at the interface between MreB and the highly conserved morphogenic protein RodZ, whereas suppressors resistant to YisK occurred primarily in mbl mutants and mapped to Mbl's predicted ATP-binding pocket. YodL's shape-altering activity appears to require MreB, as a \u0394mreB mutant was resistant to the effects of YodL but not YisK. Similarly, YisK appears to require Mbl, as a \u0394mbl mutant was resistant to the cell-widening effects of YisK but not of YodL. Collectively, our results suggest that YodL and YisK likely modulate MreB and Mbl activity, possibly during the early stages of sporulation.IMPORTANCE: The peptidoglycan (PG) component of the cell envelope confers structural rigidity to bacteria and protects them from osmotic pressure. MreB and MreB-like proteins are thought to act as scaffolds for PG synthesis and are essential in bacteria exhibiting nonpolar growth. Despite the critical role of\nYodL and YisK Possess Shape-Modifying Activities That Are Suppressed by Mutations in Bacillus subtilis mreB and mbl. UNLABELLED: Many bacteria utilize actin-like proteins to direct peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis. MreB and MreB-like proteins are thought to act as scaffolds, guiding the localization and activity of key PG-synthesizing proteins during cell elongation. Despite their critical role in viability and cell shape maintenance, very little is known about how the activity of MreB family proteins is regulated. Using a Bacillus subtilis misexpression screen, we identified two genes, yodL and yisK, that when misexpressed lead to loss of cell width control and cell lysis. Expression analysis suggested that yodL and yisK are previously uncharacterized Spo0A-regulated genes, and consistent with these observations, a \u0394yodL \u0394yisK mutant exhibited reduced sporulation efficiency. Suppressors resistant to YodL's killing activity occurred primarily in mreB mutants and resulted in amino acid substitutions at the interface between MreB and the highly\n+ beta and beta gamma+alpha were shown to yield the catalytically active enzyme. The alpha or the beta-subunit and the combinations of these subunits with the gamma-subunit were therefore expressed in E. coli in a catalytically competent state. Functional expression of the separate gamma-subunit, however, could not be demonstrated. The alpha-subunit was strongly overexpressed from a pT7-7 derived plasmid, but was only partially biotinylated under these conditions. On coexpression of the birA gene encoding biotin ligase the major part (80-100%) of the overexpressed alpha-subunit was biotinylated. Highly purified alpha-subunit was obtained by fractionated precipitation of the soluble cell fraction with ammonium sulfate. Incubation of the alpha-subunit with oxaloacetate led to a CO2 transfer to its prosthetic biotin group with the formation of stoichiometric amounts of pyruvate. The velocity of the CO2 transfer to the biotin on the alpha-subunit was about three orders of magnitude too low to account for the",

Cloning, sequence, and expression of a cDNA encoding hamster UDP-GlcNAc:dolichol phosphate N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase. UDP-GlcNAc:dolichol phosphate N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase (GPT) catalyzes the initial reaction required for synthesis of dolichol-P-P-oligosaccharides. We report here on the sequence and expression of a full-length cDNA clone encoding hamster GPT. The cDNA predicts a protein of 408 amino acid residues including 10 hydrophobic segments. Several portions of the hamster GPT sequence constituting one-third of the protein have 60% or greater identity with yeast GPT, and one-half of the conserved sequence falls within the hydrophobic segments. In addition, hamster GPT has two copies of a putative dolichol recognition sequence recently identified in three yeast enzymes that interact with dolichol. The protein lacks KDEL or DEKKMP-type carboxyl-terminal ER sorting sequences.\n(ER) by the GPT, encoded by the DPAGT1 gene. GPT catalyzes the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to dolichol-phosphate to produce dolichol-PP-GlcNAc, which is the first step in the synthesis of LLO precursor. Subsequently, LLO is transferred co-translationally to newly synthesized polypeptides. After initial processing steps in the ER, glycoproteins transit to the Golgi, where N-glycans are further modified, giving rise to mature N-glycoproteins modified with oligosaccharides ranging from high mannose/hybrid to complex. N-Glycosylation is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the dolichol phosphate-dependent N-acetylglucosamine 1-phospho-transferase (GPT), encoded by the DPAGT1 gene. GPT catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to dolichol phosphate to produce dolichol-PP-GlcNAc, which is the first step in the synthesis of a lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) precursor (Figure 1). Subsequently, LLO is transferred co-translationally to newly synthesized polypeptides.

Structure of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase, an enzyme essential for the synthesis of bacterial peptidoglycan, complexed with substrate UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and the drug fosfomycin. BACKGROUND: UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase (MurA), catalyses the first committed step of bacterial cell wall biosynthesis and is a target for the antibiotic fosfomycin. The only other known enolpyruvyl transferase is 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase, an enzyme involved in the shikimic acid pathway and the target for the herbicide glyphosate. Inhibitors of enolpyruvyl transferases are of biotechnological interest as MurA and EPSP synthase are found exclusively in plants and microbes.RESULTS: The crystal structure of Escherichia coli MurA complexed with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and fosfomycin has been determined at 1.8 A resolution. The structure consists of two domains with the active site located between them.

Many membrane-bound or exported proteins are modified by the addition and processing of glycans that can be crucial for protein folding and function, intracellular localization and transport and protein stability. Defects of these critical biological processes may affect many different organs, especially the nervous system, muscles and the intestines.The broad spectrum of both symptoms and severity often makes diagnosis of these disorders challenging. DPAGT1 encodes dolichyl-phosphate (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine) N-acetylglucosamine phosphotransferase 1. It is a transmembrane endoplasmic reticulum protein that catalyses the first committed step of the core glycan assembly, the addition of GlcNAc-1-P from cytoplasmic UDP-GlcNAc to dolichol-P. Rare mutations identified in DPAGT1 have been found to underlie a severe multisystems disorder [CDG1J (MIM 608093)] typically with delayed development, microcephaly, intractable seizures and learning difficulties. However, more recently, mutations in DPAGT1 have also been shown to be a cause of a limb-girdle form of congenital myasthenic syndrome. The congenital myasthenic\nexpression of different mutations was analysed in COS-7 cells. The results obtained, together with those of bioinformatic studies, revealed these mutations to affect the splicing process, the stability of GTP, or the ability of this protein to correctly localise in the ER membrane. The unfolded protein response (UPR; the response to ER stress) was found not to be active in patient-derived fibroblasts, unlike that seen in cells from patients with PMM2-CDG or DPM1-CDG. Even so, the fibroblasts of patients with DPAGT1-CDG seemed to be more sensitive to the stressor tunicamycin. The present work improves our knowledge of DPAGT1-CDG and provides bases for developing tailored splicing and folding therapies.

UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-dolichyl-phosphate N-acetylglucosamine phosphotransferase (GPT), the protein encoded by DPAGT1, is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein involved in an initial step in the N-glycosylation pathway. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of six variants in DPAGT1 detected in patients with DPAGT1-CDG, and the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress, as part of the search for therapeutic strategies to use against DPAGT1-CDG. The effect of the six mutations, i.e., c.358C>A (p.Leu120Met), c.791T>G (p.Val264Gly), c.901C>T (p.Arg301Cys), c.902G>A (p.Arg301His), c.1154T>G (p.Leu385Arg), and of the novel mutation c.329T>C (p.Phe110Ser), were examined via the analysis of DPAGT1 transcriptional profiles and GTP levels in patient-derived fibroblasts.

In the current study, we found that upregulation of dolichyl-phosphate N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (DPAGT1) sustained high-level HER2 shedding to confer trastuzumab resistance, which was associated with poor clinical outcomes. Upon trastuzumab treatment, the membrane-bound DPAGT1 protein was endocytosed via the caveolae pathway and retrogradely transported to the ER, where DPAGT1 induced N-glycosylation of the sheddase - ADAM metallopeptidase domain 10 (ADAM10) - to ensure its expression, maturation, and activation. N-glycosylation of ADAM10 at N267 protected itself from ER-associated protein degradation and was essential for DPAGT1-mediated HER2 shedding and trastuzumab resistance. Importantly, inhibition of DPAGT1 with tunicamycin acted synergistically with trastuzumab treatment to block HER2 signaling and reverse resistance. These findings reveal a prominent mechanism for HER2 shedding and suggest that targeting DPAGT1 might be a promising strategy against trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer.

Oral cancer is one of the most aggressive epithelial malignancies, whose incidence is on the rise. Previous studies have shown that in a subset of human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tumor specimens, overexpression of the DPAGT1 gene, encoding the dolichol-P-dependent N-acetylglucoseamine-1-phosphate transferase, a key regulator of the metabolic pathway of protein N-glycosylation, drives tumor cell discohesion by inhibiting E-cadherin adhesive function. Recently, we reported that DPAGT1 was a target of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Here, we link overexpression of DPAGT1 in human OSCC tumor specimens to aberrant activation of canonical Wnt signaling. We report dramatic increases in \u03b2- and \u03b3-catenins at the DPAGT1 promoter and correlate them with reduced expression of a Wnt inhibitor, Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1). Using human squamous carcinoma cell lines of the head and neck, we show that partial inhibition of DPAGT1 reduces canonical Wnt signaling, indicating that DPAGT1 and canonical Wnt\nof ER stress and inhibition of EGFR N-glycosylation by tunicamycin enhances susceptibility of human non-small cell lung cancer cells to erlotinib N-Glycosylation Induces the CTHRC1 protein and drives oral cancer cell migration N-Glycosylation affects the molecular organization and stability of E-cadherin junctions Frequent mutation of the PI3K pathway in head and neck cancer defines predictive biomarkers Negative regulatory element involved in the hormonal regulation of GlcNAc-1-P transferase gene in mouse mammary gland Wnt/beta-catenin signaling: Components, mechanisms, and diseases Plakoglobin (gamma-catenin) has TCF/LEF family-dependent transcriptional activity in beta-catenin-deficient cell line Activity of the beta-catenin phosphodestruction complex at cell-cell contacts is enhanced by cadherin-based adhesion The secret life of alpha-catenin: Moonlighting in morphogenesis Epithelial to mesenchymal transition in head and neck squamous carcinoma: Association of Src activation with E-cadherin down-regulation, vimentin expression, and aggressive tumor features The epithelial-mesenchymal transition generates cells with properties of stem cells A recessive deletion in the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase\nsignaling, Slug, and MAPK The cadherin-catenin adhesion system in signaling and cancer Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation disrupts receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in tumor cells Both potential dolichol recognition sequences of hamster GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase are necessary for normal enzyme function N-Glycan biosynthesis inhibitors induce in vitro anticancer activity in colorectal cancer cells Beta 1,6-branching of Asn-linked oligosaccaride is directly associated with metastases Metabolism, cell surface organization, and disease Cell polarity triggered by cell-cell adhesion via E-cadherin MAP kinase signalling pathways in cancer Correlation between E-cadherin expression and invasiveness in vitro in a human esophageal cancer cell line Alpha-catenin is a molecular switch that binds E-cadherin-beta-catenin and regulates actin filament assembly Differential expression of proliferative, cytoskeletal, and adhesive proteins during postnatal development of the hamster submandibular gland Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in cancer stemness and malignant behavior Expression of E-cadherin and alpha-catenin in patients with colorectal carcinoma.

        "desc": "for a number of physiological functions regulating protein homeostasis, such as protein degradation. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control system recognizes and degrades proteins no longer needed in the ER through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. E2 and E3 enzymes containing a transmembrane domain have been shown to function in ER quality control. The ER transmembrane protein UBE2J1 is a E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme reported to be essential for spermiogenesis at the elongating spermatid stage. Spermatids from Ube2j1 KO male mice are believed to have defects in the dislocation step of ER quality control. However, associated E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases that function during spermatogenesis remain unknown.RESULTS: We identified four evolutionarily conserved testis-specific E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases [RING finger protein 133 (Rnf133); RING finger protein 148 (Rnf148); RING finger protein 151 (Rnf151); and Zinc finger SWIM-type containing 2 (Zswim2)]. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we generated and analyzed the fertility of mutant mice with null alleles for\na RING finger-dependent manner. From a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML) as an RNF122-interacting protein. To examine the interaction between CAML and RNF122, we performed co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization experiments using intact cells. What is more, we found that CAML is not a substrate of ubiquitin ligase RNF122, but that, instead, it stabilizes RNF122.CONCLUSIONS: RNF122 can be characterized as a C3H2C3-type RING finger-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase localized to the ER. RNF122 promotes its own degradation in a RING finger-and proteasome-dependent manner. RNF122 interacts with CAML, and its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity was noted to be dependent on the RING finger domain. Isolation, characterization, and partial purification of a novel ubiquitin-protein ligase, E3. Targeting of protein substrates via multiple and distinct recognition signals and conjugating enzymes. Degradation of a protein via the ubiquitin system involves two discrete steps, conjugation of ubiquitin to the substrate and degradation of the\nsites. Here we characterize the PAR binding protein, Iduna, and show that it is a PAR-dependent ubiquitin E3 ligase. Iduna's E3 ligase activity requires PAR binding because point mutations at Y156A and R157A eliminate Iduna's PAR binding and Iduna's E3 ligase activity. Iduna's E3 ligase activity also requires an intact really interesting new gene (RING) domain because Iduna possessing point mutations at either H54A or C60A is devoid of ubiquitination activity. Tandem affinity purification reveals that Iduna binds to a number of proteins that are either PARsylated or bind PAR including PAR polymerase-1, 2 (PARP1, 2), nucleolin, DNA ligase III, KU70, KU86, XRCC1, and histones. PAR binding to Iduna activates its E3 ligase function, and PAR binding is required for Iduna ubiquitination of PARP1, XRCC1, DNA ligase III, and KU70. Iduna's PAR-dependent ubiquitination of PARP1 targets it for proteasomal degradation. Via PAR binding and ubiquitin E3 ligase activity, Iduna protects\ncomplexity. Comprehensive database of human E3 ubiquitin ligases: application to aquaporin-2 regulation. Aquaporin-2 (AQP2) is regulated in part via vasopressin-mediated changes in protein half-life that are in turn dependent on AQP2 ubiquitination. Here we addressed the question, \"What E3 ubiquitin ligase is most likely to be responsible for AQP2 ubiquitination?\" using large-scale data integration based on Bayes' rule. The first step was to bioinformatically identify all E3 ligase genes coded by the human genome. The 377 E3 ubiquitin ligases identified in the human genome, consisting predominant of HECT, RING, and U-box proteins, have been used to create a publically accessible and downloadable online database (https://hpcwebapps.cit.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/E3-ligases/). We also curated a second database of E3 ligase accessory proteins that included BTB domain proteins, cullins, SOCS-box proteins, and F-box proteins. Using Bayes' theorem to integrate information from multiple large-scale proteomic and transcriptomic datasets, we ranked these 377 E3 ligases with respect to their\nregulator of mitophagy and provides a plausible mechanism for its function in this process. An RNF11: Smurf2 complex mediates ubiquitination of the AMSH protein. RING-finger proteins play crucial roles in ubiquitination events involved in diverse cellular processes including signal transduction, differentiation and apoptosis. Most of the RING-finger proteins have E3-ubiquitin ligase activity. RNF11 is a small RING-finger protein and harbors a RING-H2 domain and a PY motif that could facilitate protein:protein interaction(s) involved in oncogenesis. To isolate RNF11 protein partners and determine its role in normal and cancer cells, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening. Among 18 in-frame positive clones, three were found to be ZBRK1, Eps15 and AMSH (associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM). ZBRK1 is a KRAB domain containing Zinc-finger protein and is known to repress target gene transcription in a BRCA1-dependent manner. Eps15 is monoubiquitinated and is part of an essential complex involved in the endocytosis\nand was impaired by siRNA-mediated MGRN1 knockdown thus pointing to MGRN1 as the responsible E3-ligase. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated interaction of MGRN1 and ARRBs in the presence of MC1R, suggesting a scaffolding role for the GPCR that may determine the selectivity of E3-ubiquitin ligase engagement and the functional outcome of ARRB ubiquitination. UbiNet 2.0: a verified, classified, annotated and updated database of E3 ubiquitin ligase-substrate interactions. Ubiquitination is an important post-translational modification, which controls protein turnover by labeling malfunctional and redundant proteins for proteasomal degradation, and also serves intriguing non-proteolytic regulatory functions. E3 ubiquitin ligases, whose substrate specificity determines the recognition of target proteins of ubiquitination, play crucial roles in ubiquitin-proteasome system. UbiNet 2.0 is an updated version of the database UbiNet. It contains 3332 experimentally verified E3-substrate interactions (ESIs) in 54 organisms and rich annotations useful for investigating the regulation of ubiquitination and the substrate specificity of E3 ligases. Based\nmass spectrometric signal intensity demonstrated a drastic decrease of filamin A and filamin B in myeloid leukemia cells expressing wild-type ASB2 compared with cells expressing an E3 ubiquitin ligase-defective mutant of ASB2. Altogether we provide an original strategy that enables identification of E3 ubiquitin ligase substrates that have to be degraded. Human melanocortin 1 receptor-mediated ubiquitination of nonvisual arrestins. Role of Mahogunin Ring Finger 1 E3 ligase. Signaling from the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), a Gs protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) crucial for melanocyte proliferation and differentiation, is regulated by cytosolic \u03b2-arrestins (ARRBs). MC1R signaling is also negatively modulated by the E3-ubiquitin ligase Mahogunin Ring Finger-1 (MGRN1), whose mutation causes hyperpigmentation, congenital heart defects and neurodegeneration in mice. We showed previously that although MC1R interacts stably with human ARRB1 or ARRB2, only ARRB2 mediates receptor desensitization and internalization. We analyzed MC1R-dependent ARRB ubiquitination, and the possible role of MGRN1. ARRB1 expressed in\nwith RNF133.CONCLUSIONS: Our studies reveal that RNF133 is a testis-expressed E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that plays a critical role for sperm function during spermiogenesis. Based on the presence of a transmembrane domain in RNF133 and its interaction with the ER containing E2 protein UBE2J1, we hypothesize that these ubiquitin-regulatory proteins function together in ER quality control during spermatogenesis. Molecular characterization of substrate-induced ubiquitin transfer by UBR7-PHD finger, a newly identified histone H2BK120 ubiquitin ligase. Monoubiquitination of histone H2B at lysine 120 plays a vital role in active transcription and DNA damage response pathways. Ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component N-recognin 7 (UBR7) has been recently identified as an H2BK120 monoubiquitin ligase. However, the molecular details of its ubiquitin transfer mechanism are not well understood. Here, we report that the plant homeodomain (PHD) finger of UBR7 is essential for its association with E2 UbcH6 and consequent ubiquitin transfer to its substrate histone H2B.\nrepeat of CUL1 (and CUL7). Direct substrate recognition by SCF is performed by the variable component of the substrate receptor, an F-box protein. The F-box is a ~40 AA domain that binds SKP1, and is usually located in the F-box protein adjacent to a protein-protein interaction domain (ie: WD40 repeats or leucine-rich repeats) for substrate binding. Thus, F-box proteins are tethered to the SCF core by SKP1 and recruit a spectrum of substrates through additional domains. E2 recruitment by all cullins relies on its tight interaction with the small RING finger protein ROC1. ROC1 is an essential and highly conserved RING-H2 protein, and harbors the ~70 AA RING finger domain. Through its RING finger, ROC1 is able to recruit and activate E2. DDB1 was found to interact with CUL4A and was subsequently shown to be the adaptor for CUL4 E3 ligase. As an adaptor protein of CUL4 ligase, loss of\n20 (RNF20) through a thioester hydrolysis assay. Interestingly, binding of substrate H2B to UBR7 induces a conformational change in the PHD finger, which triggers ubiquitin transfer from UbcH6. However, the RNF20 RING finger alone is sufficient to promote the release of ubiquitin from UbcH6. Overall, the mechanism of ubiquitin transfer by the newly identified E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR7 is markedly different from that of RNF20. Activation of UBC5 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme by the RING finger of ROC1 and assembly of active ubiquitin ligases by all cullins. Protein ubiquitination plays an important role in regulating the abundance and conformation of a broad range of eukaryotic proteins. This process involves a cascade of enzymes including ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), and ubiquitin ligases (E3). E1 and E2 represent two families of structurally related proteins and are relatively well characterized. In contrast, the nature and mechanism of E3, proposed to contain activities in\ncontaining 2 (Zswim2)]. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we generated and analyzed the fertility of mutant mice with null alleles for each of these E3-encoding genes, as well as double and triple knockout (KO) mice. Male fertility, male reproductive organ, and sperm-associated parameters were analyzed in detail. Fecundity remained largely unaffected in Rnf148, Rnf151, and Zswim2 KO males; however, Rnf133 KO males displayed severe subfertility. Additionally, Rnf133 KO sperm exhibited abnormal morphology and reduced motility. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated that cytoplasmic droplets were retained in Rnf133 KO spermatozoa. Although Rnf133 and Rnf148 encode paralogous genes that are chromosomally linked and encode putative ER transmembrane E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases based on their protein structures, there was limited functional redundancy of these proteins. In addition, we identified UBE2J1 as an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating protein that interacts with RNF133.CONCLUSIONS: Our studies reveal that RNF133 is a testis-expressed E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that plays a critical role for sperm\nin regulating RIPK2 ubiquitination. We conclude that phosphorylation can disrupt the binding of an E3 ubiquitin ligase to an E2-conjugating enzyme, leading to prolonged inflammatory signaling. To our knowledge, this is the first report of E3 ubiquitin ligase phosphorylation inhibiting E3 ligase activity by impairing E2-E3 complex formation. A label-free quantitative proteomics strategy to identify E3 ubiquitin ligase substrates targeted to proteasome degradation. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is a central mechanism for controlled proteolysis that regulates numerous cellular processes in eukaryotes. As such, defects in this system can contribute to disease pathogenesis. In this pathway, E3 ubiquitin ligases provide platforms for binding specific substrates, thereby coordinating their ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Despite the identification of many E3 ubiquitin ligases, the identities of their specific substrates are still largely unresolved. The ankyrin repeat-containing protein with a suppressor of cytokine signaling box 2 (ASB2) gene that we initially identified as\nE3 ubiquitin ligases. Hence, we are interested to identify whether Znf179 possesses E3 ligase activity and its role in ALS neuropathy.METHODS: We used in vivo and in vitro ubiquitination assay to examine the E3 ligase autoubiquitination activity of Znf179 and its effect on 26S proteasome activity. To search for the candidate substrates of Znf179, we immunoprecipitated Znf179 and subjected to mass spectrometry (MS) analysis to identify its interacting proteins. We found that ALS/ FTLD-U (frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with ubiquitin inclusions)-related neurodegenerative TDP-43 protein is the E3 ligase substrate of Znf179. To further clarify the role of E3 ubiquitin ligase Znf179 in neurodegenerative TDP-43-UBI (ubiquitinated inclusions) (+) proteinopathy, the effect of Znf179-mediated TDP-43 polyubiquitination on TDP-43 protein stability, aggregate formation and nucleus/cytoplasm mislocalization were evaluated in vitro cell culture system and in vivo animal model.RESULTS: Here we report that Znf179 is a RING E3 ubiquitin ligase which possesses autoubiquitination feature\nof RNF11 and that a consequent reduction in its steady-state level requires both RNF11 and Smurf2. RNF11 therefore recruits AMSH to Smurf2 for ubiquitination, leading to its degradation by the 26S proteasome. The potential functions of RNF11-mediated degradation of AMSH in breast cancer are discussed. Znf179 E3 ligase-mediated TDP-43 polyubiquitination is involved in TDP-43- ubiquitinated inclusions (UBI) (+)-related neurodegenerative pathology. BACKGROUND: The brain predominantly expressed RING finger protein, Znf179, is known to be important for embryonic neuronal differentiation during brain development. Downregulation of Znf179 has been observed in motor neurons of adult mouse models for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), yet the molecular function of Znf179 in neurodegeneration has never been previously described. Znf179 contains the classical C3HC4 RING finger domain, and numerous proteins containing C3HC4 RING finger domain act as E3 ubiquitin ligases. Hence, we are interested to identify whether Znf179 possesses E3 ligase activity and its role in ALS\nhave developed a predictive model for human proteome-wide ubiquitin ligase-substrate relationship. We measured a total of 14,459,214 E3-protein pairs between 714 E3s and 20,251 human proteins, and identified 14,419 high confidence potential E3-substrate interactions. We also build a user-friendly E3-substrate interaction browser to present the predicted E3-substrate network together with their supporting evidence. Kai-Yao et al. have tried to construct a full protein ubiquitylation networks, however, their work cannot distinguish the E3\u2019s substrates and regulators. We examined 100 prediction results randomly sampling from Kai-Yao Huang et al.\u2019s work and UbiBrowser. As shown in Supplementary Table 1, we found that only 2 results are regulators (2%) for UbiBrowser while 21 are regulators of E3s (21%) for Kai-Yao Huang et al.\u2019s work. The ratio of regulators from UbiBrowser was significantly lower than that from Kai-Yao Huang et al.\u2019s work (P value = 1.25 \u00d7 10\u22125, one-tailed Fisher\u2019s exact test). The underlying reason\noccurrence and worsening of these diseases. E3 ligases can regulate the stability of these disease promoters by mediating their proteasomal degradation. Detection of the E3 ligases for these disease promoters will help to reveal the underlying pathological mechanisms and further therapeutical treatments. Using UbiBrowser, we tried to predict the interaction between the disease promoters and their potential upstream regulatory E3 ligases. ITCH-TAB1: TAB1 (TGF-beta-activated kinase 1-binding protein 1) can activate p38\u03b1 (a mitogen-activated protein kinase). The activation of p38\u03b1 can induce several inflammatory skin disorders, such as hapten-induced contact dermatitis, ultraviolet irradiation\u2013induced dermatitis, and human psoriatic lesions. Therefore TAB1 was regarded as potential promoter for inflammatory skin disorders. Among the predicted E3 ligases for TAB1 in UbiBrowser, ITCH ((itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase) was given a relative high LR: 2.65 (Rank: 12) and was reported to play an important role in inflammation and the regulation of epithelial and hematopoietic cell\nwith histone H3 methylated at K4 and is essential for H3 K4 methylation and vertebrate development Dynamic regulation of histone lysine methylation by demethylases Histone ubiquitylation and the regulation of transcription The DDB1-CUL4ADDB2 ubiquitin ligase is deficient in xeroderma pigmentosum group E and targets histone H2A at UV-damaged DNA sites Histone H3 and H4 ubiquitylation by the CUL4-DDB-ROC1 ubiquitin ligase facilitates cellular response to DNA damage Structure and E3-ligase activity of the Ring-Ring complex of polycomb proteins Bmi1 and Ring1b The human homologue for the Caenorhabditis elegans cul-4 gene is amplified and overexpressed in primary breast cancers TFDP1, CUL4A, and CDC16 identified as targets for amplification at 13q34 in hepatocellular carcinomas The testis-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF133 is required for fecundity in mice. BACKGROUND: Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification required for a number of physiological functions regulating protein homeostasis, such as protein degradation. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control system\nfrom other known E3s, including E3 alpha/UBR1, E3 beta, and E6-AP. The native enzyme has an apparent molecular mass of approximately 550 kDa and appears to be a homodimer. Because of its unusual size, we designated this novel ligase E3L (large). E3L contains an -SH group that is essential for its activity. Like several recently described E3 enzymes, including E6-AP and the ligase involved in the processing of p105, the NF-kappa B precursor, the novel ligase is found in mammalian tissues but not in wheat germ. Iduna is a poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR)-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates DNA damage. Ubiquitin mediated protein degradation is crucial for regulation of cell signaling and protein quality control. Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) is a cell-signaling molecule that mediates changes in protein function through binding at PAR binding sites. Here we characterize the PAR binding protein, Iduna, and show that it is a PAR-dependent ubiquitin E3 ligase. Iduna's\nefficacy to suppress HCC progression via altering the androgen receptor (AR)-ULBP2 signals Autophagy Is an Innate Mechanism Associated with Leprosy Polarization PC4 promotes genome stability and DNA repair through binding of ssDNA at DNA damage sites RNF122: a novel ubiquitin ligase associated with calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand. BACKGROUND: RNF122 is a recently discovered RING finger protein that is associated with HEK293T cell viability and is overexpressed in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells. RNF122 owns a RING finger domain in C terminus and transmembrane domain in N terminus. However, the biological mechanism underlying RNF122 action remains unknown.RESULTS: In this study, we characterized RNF122 both biochemically and intracellularly in order to gain an understanding of its biological role. RNF122 was identified as a new ubiquitin ligase that can ubiquitinate itself and undergoes degradation in a RING finger-dependent manner. From a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML) as an RNF122-interacting protein.

        "desc": "Differential modulation of Beta-adrenergic receptor signaling by trace amine-associated receptor 1 agonists. Trace amine-associated receptors (TAAR) are rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). TAAR are involved in modulation of neuronal, cardiac and vascular functions and they are potentially linked with neurological disorders like schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Subtype TAAR1, the best characterized TAAR so far, is promiscuous for a wide set of ligands and is activated by trace amines tyramine (TYR), phenylethylamine (PEA), octopamine (OA), but also by thyronamines, dopamine, and psycho-active drugs. Unfortunately, effects of trace amines on signaling of the two homologous \u03b2-adrenergic receptors 1 (ADRB1) and 2 (ADRB2) have not been clarified yet in detail. We, therefore, tested TAAR1 agonists TYR, PEA and OA regarding their effects on ADRB1/2 signaling by co-stimulation studies. Surprisingly, trace amines TYR and PEA are partial allosteric antagonists at ADRB1/2, whereas OA is a partial orthosteric ADRB2-antagonist and ADRB1-agonist. To specify molecular reasons for\nare partial allosteric antagonists at ADRB1/2, whereas OA is a partial orthosteric ADRB2-antagonist and ADRB1-agonist. To specify molecular reasons for TAAR1 ligand promiscuity and for observed differences in signaling effects on particular aminergic receptors we compared TAAR, tyramine (TAR) octopamine (OAR), ADRB1/2 and dopamine receptors at the structural level. We found especially for TAAR1 that the remarkable ligand promiscuity is likely based on high amino acid similarity in the ligand-binding region compared with further aminergic receptors. On the other hand few TAAR specific properties in the ligand-binding site might determine differences in ligand-induced effects compared to ADRB1/2. Taken together, this study points to molecular details of TAAR1-ligand promiscuity and identified specific trace amines as allosteric or orthosteric ligands of particular \u03b2-adrenergic receptor subtypes.

Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry further showed that TAAR7 expression was downregulated not only in valproic acid-treated animals, but also BTBR T+tf/J mice.CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the advantages of gene microarrays to uncover co-expression modules associated with autism and suggests that Taars and related gene regulation networks may play a significant role in autism.\nAnimal Model of Autism. BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders that display complicated behavioral symptoms.METHODS: Using gene expressing profiling and the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we studied genes coregulated by similar factors such as genetic variants or environmental effects in the hippocampus in an animal model of autism.RESULTS: From microarray data, we identified 21,388 robustly expressed genes of which 721 genes were found to be differently expressed in the valproic acid-treated group compared to the control group. WGCNA identified multiple co-expression modules known to associate with cognitive function, inflammation, synaptic, and positive regulation of protein kinase activating. Many of these modules, however, have not been previously linked to autism spectrum disorders which included G-protein signaling, immunity, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway. The downregulation of the highly connected (hub) genes Taar7h and Taar7b in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway was validated by qRT-PCR. Immunoblotting",

TAARs emerged following the divergence of jawed and jawless fish, and comprise a large monophyletic family of receptors that recognize volatile amine odorants to elicit both intraspecific and interspecific innate behaviours such as attraction and aversion3-5. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of mouse TAAR9 (mTAAR9) and mTAAR9-Gs or mTAAR9-Golf trimers in complex with \u03b2-phenylethylamine, N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine or spermidine. The mTAAR9 structures contain a deep and tight ligand-binding pocket decorated with a conserved D3.32W6.48Y7.43 motif, which is essential for amine odorant recognition. In the mTAAR9 structure, a unique disulfide bond connecting the N terminus to ECL2 is required for agonist-induced receptor activation. We identify key structural motifs of TAAR family members for detecting monoamines and polyamines and the shared sequence of different TAAR members that are responsible for recognition of the same odour chemical. We elucidate the molecular\nligand preparation: Parameters, protocols, and influence on virtual screening enrichments New insights about HERG blockade obtained from protein modeling, potential energy mapping, and docking studies Supporting information Recognition of methamphetamine and other amines by trace amine receptor TAAR1. Trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), the founding member of a nine-member family of trace amine receptors, is responsible for recognizing a range of biogenic amines in the brain, including the endogenous \u03b2-phenylethylamine (\u03b2-PEA)1 as well as methamphetamine2, an abused substance that has posed a severe threat to human health and society3. Given its unique physiological role in the brain, TAAR1 is also an emerging target for a range of neurological disorders including schizophrenia, depression and drug addiction2,4,5. Here we report structures of human TAAR1-G-protein complexes bound to methamphetamine and \u03b2-PEA as well as complexes bound to RO5256390, a TAAR1-selective agonist, and SEP-363856, a clinical-stage dual agonist for TAAR1 and serotonin receptor 5-HT1AR\ndirect control over DA and 5-HT neuronal firing and release, which has profound implications for understanding the pathophysiology of, and therefore designing more efficacious therapeutic interventions for, a range of neuropsychiatric disorders that involve aminergic dysregulation, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, mood disorders, and addiction. Indeed, the recent development of novel pharmacological tools targeting TAAR1 has uncovered the remarkable potential of TAAR1-based medications as new generation pharmacotherapies in neuropsychiatry. This review summarizes recent developments in the study of TAs and TAAR1, their intricate neurochemistry and pharmacology, and their relevance for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease. Functional interaction between trace amine-associated receptor 1 and dopamine D2 receptor. The ability of dopamine receptors to interact with other receptor subtypes may provide mechanisms for modulating dopamine-related functions and behaviors. In particular, there is evidence suggesting that the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) affects the dopaminergic system by regulating the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons or\nLigand recognition and G-protein coupling of trace amine receptor TAAR1. Trace-amine-associated receptors (TAARs), a group of biogenic amine receptors, have essential roles in neurological and metabolic homeostasis1. They recognize diverse endogenous trace amines and subsequently activate a range of G-protein-subtype signalling pathways2,3. Notably, TAAR1 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for treating psychiatric disorders4,5. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its ability to recognize different ligands remain largely unclear. Here we present nine cryo-electron microscopy structures, with eight showing human and mouse TAAR1 in a complex with an array of ligands, including the endogenous 3-iodothyronamine, two antipsychotic agents, the psychoactive drug amphetamine and two identified catecholamine agonists, and one showing 5-HT1AR in a complex with an antipsychotic agent. These structures reveal a rigid consensus binding motif in TAAR1 that binds to endogenous trace amine stimuli and two extended binding pockets that accommodate diverse chemotypes. Combined with mutational analysis, functional assays\nto endogenous trace amine stimuli and two extended binding pockets that accommodate diverse chemotypes. Combined with mutational analysis, functional assays and molecular dynamic simulations, we elucidate the structural basis of drug polypharmacology and identify the species-specific differences between human and mouse TAAR1. Our study provides insights into the mechanism of ligand recognition and G-protein selectivity by TAAR1, which may help in the discovery of ligands or therapeutic strategies for neurological and metabolic disorders. Trace Amines and the Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1: Pharmacology, Neurochemistry, and Clinical Implications. Biogenic amines are a collection of endogenous molecules that play pivotal roles as neurotransmitters and hormones. In addition to the \"classical\" biogenic amines resulting from decarboxylation of aromatic acids, including dopamine (DA), norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin (5-HT), and histamine, other biogenic amines, present at much lower concentrations in the central nervous system (CNS), and hence referred to as \"trace\" amines (TAs), are now recognized to\nlower concentrations in the central nervous system (CNS), and hence referred to as \"trace\" amines (TAs), are now recognized to play significant neurophysiological and behavioral functions. At the turn of the century, the discovery of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a phylogenetically conserved G protein-coupled receptor that is responsive to both TAs, such as \u03b2-phenylethylamine, octopamine, and tyramine, and structurally-related amphetamines, unveiled mechanisms of action for TAs other than interference with aminergic pathways, laying the foundations for deciphering the functional significance of TAs and its mammalian CNS receptor, TAAR1. Although, its molecular interactions and downstream targets have not been fully elucidated, TAAR1 activation triggers accumulation of intracellular cAMP, modulates PKA and PKC signaling and interferes with the \u03b2-arrestin2-dependent pathway via G protein-independent mechanisms. TAAR1 is uniquely positioned to exert direct control over DA and 5-HT neuronal firing and release, which has profound implications for understanding the pathophysiology of, and\nthat the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) affects the dopaminergic system by regulating the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons or by altering dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) responsiveness to ligands. TAAR1 is a G\u03b1(s) protein-coupled receptor that is activated by biogenic amines, \"trace amines,\" such as \u03b2-phenylethylamine (\u03b2-PEA) and tyramine that are normally found at low concentrations in the mammalian brain. In the present study, we investigated the biochemical mechanism of interaction between TAAR1 and D2R and the role this interaction plays in D2R-related signaling and behaviors. Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer biosensor for cAMP, we demonstrated that the D2R antagonists haloperidol, raclopride, and amisulpride were able to enhance selectively a TAAR1-mediated \u03b2-PEA increase of cAMP. Moreover, TAAR1 and D2R were able to form heterodimers when coexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and this direct interaction was disrupted in the presence of haloperidol.

Together with systematic mutagenesis and functional studies, the structures reveal the molecular basis of methamphetamine recognition and underlying mechanisms of ligand selectivity and polypharmacology between TAAR1 and other monoamine receptors. We identify a lid-like extracellular loop 2 helix/loop structure and a hydrogen-bonding network in the ligand-binding pockets, which may contribute to the ligand recognition in TAAR1. These findings shed light on the ligand recognition mode and activation mechanism for TAAR1 and should guide the development of next-generation therapeutics for drug addiction and various neurological disorders. Structural basis of amine odorant perception by a mammal olfactory receptor. Odorants are detected as smell in the nasal epithelium of mammals by two G-protein-coupled receptor families, the odorant receptors and the trace amine-associated receptors1,2 (TAARs).

We elucidate the molecular basis of mTAAR9 coupling to Gs and Golf by structural characterization and mutational analysis. Collectively, our results provide a structural basis for odorant detection, receptor activation and Golf coupling of an amine olfactory receptor.\nbulky aromatic residue facilitates access of ligands into the internal binding pocket and generates a more sensitive receptor for amine detection. In contrast, the W7.40A mutation might result in a loss of structural stability by replacing the aromatic side chain with a methyl side chain, which abrogates potential aromatic interactions with neighboring amino acids, or it may reduce receptor overall stability. Taken together, these observations suggest that the Trp7.40 residue of the aminergic DW motif plays different pharmacological roles in modulating amine response profiles in sTAAR365 and mTAAR9. Discussion Olfactory TAARs enable vertebrates to detect volatile or soluble amines that are ubiquitous in their habitat. The structural determinants for TAARs that recognize amines with a wide range of amino groups have remained elusive, largely due to the lack of crystal structures for any olfactory receptor. In the present study, we examined the structural basis of sTAAR365 and mTAAR9 for detection\npocket for polyamines in sTAAR365 and mTAAR9. Thr7.42 is a distinct polyamine recognition motif in sTAAR365 Concentration\u2013response curves of sTAAR365 and mTAAR9 mutated at a sTAAR365 specific amine recognition site (Thr7.42). HEK293T or Hana3A cells were transfected with wild-type sTAAR365, wild-type mTAAR9, or Thr7.42 mutants of sTAAR365 and mTAAR9, and incubated with dilutions of ligands. Receptor activity was normalized to the basal activity of buffer-treated cells (mean \u00b1 S.D., n = 3). A, concentration-dependent cAMP production of HEK293T cells expressing sTAAR365 and its T7.42 mutants when stimulated with cadaverine, putrescine, and spermine. B, concentration-dependent luciferase activity of Hana3A cells expressing mTAAR9 and the V7.42T mutant stimulated with cadaverine, spermidine, and triethylamine. Our docking studies of sTAAR365 predicted that the polar residue Thr7.42 is involved in amine recognition by forming a potential hydrogen bond. We substituted the Thr7.42 residue with alanine, valine, methionine, or serine to examine the effect on receptor\nkidney 293 cells, and this direct interaction was disrupted in the presence of haloperidol. In addition, in mice lacking TAAR1, haloperidol-induced striatal c-Fos expression and catalepsy were significantly reduced. Taken together, these data suggest that TAAR1 and D2R have functional and physical interactions that could be critical for the modulation of the dopaminergic system by TAAR1 in vivo. Convergent olfactory trace amine-associated receptors detect biogenic polyamines with distinct motifs via a conserved binding site Biogenic amines activate G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the central nervous system in vertebrate animals. Several biogenic amines, when excreted, stimulate trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs), a group of GPCRs in the main olfactory epithelium, and elicit innate behaviors. How TAARs recognize amines with varying numbers of amino groups is largely unknown. We reasoned that a comparison between lamprey and mammalian olfactory TAARs, which are thought to have evolved independently but show convergent responses to polyamines, may reveal\ncontain a noncanonical amine-detection site Glu3.32 on transmembrane III. Here, we also showed that Asp3.32, but not Trp7.40, forms a salt bridge with one amino group in polyamines, which is an essential element for polyamine recognition by both sTAAR365 and mTAAR9. The Asp3.32 residue is highly conserved among class A GPCRs, and a similar salt bridge between Asp3.32 and the ligand amino group has been described in crystal structures of aminergic receptors, including \u03b21 adrenergic receptor, \u03b22 adrenergic receptor, and H1 histamine receptor. Charge-neutralizing mutation of Asp3.32 abolished the ability of sTAAR365 and mTAAR9 to detect polyamines. However, mutation of Asp3.32 to Glu in sTAAR365 retained receptor activity to polyamines but reduced ligand potency. Thus, the salt bridge formed by the amino group of polyamines and the anionic carboxylate group of residue 3.32 is relatively flexible in sTAAR365, with Asp3.32 having a stronger interaction than Glu3.32. This phenomenon is consistent\nspermidine through an additional aromatic residue, Tyr7.43. These results suggest a conserved mechanism whereby independently evolved TAAR receptors recognize amines with two, three, or four amino groups using the same recognition sites, at which sTAAR365 and mTAAR9 evolved distinct motifs. These motifs interact directly with the amino groups of the polyamines, a class of potent and ecologically important odorants, mediating olfactory signaling. Biogenic amines are a group of signaling molecules that activate G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and regulate a wide variety of neurophysiologic and behavioral functions. Recognition of amine neurotransmitters, which are often monoamines that activate the aminergic family of GPCRs in vertebrate central nervous systems, has been examined extensively. Besides, some excreted biogenic amines function as odorants and are detected by another family of GPCRs, the olfactory trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs). These molecules are categorized based on the number of amino groups as either monoamine (one amino group, such as\nmutation of Trp7.40in the conserved aminergic DW motif. HEK293T or Hana3A cells were transfected with wild-type sTAAR365, wild-type mTAAR9, or Trp7.40 mutants of sTAAR365 and mTAAR9, and incubated with concentration-dependent ligands. Receptor activity was normalized to the basal activity of buffer-treated cells (mean \u00b1 S.D., n = 3). A, concentration-dependent cAMP production of HEK293T cells expressing sTAAR365 and its W7.40 mutants stimulated with cadaverine, putrescine, and spermine.

A schematic diagram describing the proposed polyamine recognition sites in convergent sTAAR365 and mTAAR9.Cartoon representations of sTAAR365 (green) and mTAAR9 (blue) structures show seven transmembrane domains and two short \u03b1-helices. Conservative amine recognition residues (Asp3.32 and Tyr6.51) are indicated with carnation circle dots. Distinctive amine recognition residues (Glu7.36 and Thr7.42 in sTAAR365; Tyr7.43 in mTAAR9) are labeled with magenta circle dots. Tangerine circle dots\nstructures for any olfactory receptor. In the present study, we examined the structural basis of sTAAR365 and mTAAR9 for detection of polyamines with up to four amino groups. The sea lamprey and jawed vertebrate TAARs are suggested to have evolved independently, forming distinct clades. Receptors from both clades recognize polyamines, providing a unique opportunity to characterize polyamine recognition sites across independently evolved vertebrate GPCRs. Previous studies have demonstrated that teleost TAARs utilize a canonical amine-detection site Asp3.32 or a noncanonical amine-detection site Asp5.42 (or both) to recognize various monoamines or diamines. However, sTAAR365 and mammalian TAAR9s contain the canonical Asp3.32 but lack the Asp5.42, implying that these receptors may have evolved alternative mechanisms to recognize various polyamines with two or more amino groups. Based on the odotope theory, we propose a hypothetical structural model for polyamine recognition by two clades of independently evolved TAARs, represented by sTAAR365 and mTAAR9. The",

Yeast two-hybrid screening for PRL-2-interacting proteins identified the beta-subunit of Rab geranylgeranyltransferase II (betaGGT II). The specific interaction of betaGGT II with PRL-2 but not with PRL-1 or -3 occurred in yeast and HeLa cells. Chimeric PRL-1/-2 molecules were tested for their interaction with betaGGT II, and revealed that the C-terminal region of PRL-2 is required for interaction, possibly the PRL variable region immediately preceeding the CAAX box. Additionally, PRL-2 prenylation is prequisite for betaGGT II binding. As prenylated PRL-2 is localized to the early endosome, we propose that this is where the interaction occurs. PRL-2 is not a substrate for betaGGT II, as isoprenoid analysis showed that PRL-2 was solely farnesylated in vivo. Co-expression of the alpha-subunit\nof PALM2 (PALM2C408S) impaired its membranous localization and reduced the membrane location of PALM2, indicating PALM2 was prenylated by FTase. Overexpression of PALM2 enhanced the migration of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells, whereas PALM2C408S lost this ability. Mechanistically, PALM2 interacted with the N-terminal FERM domain of ezrin of the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family. Mutagenesis indicated that lysine residues K253/K254/K262/K263 in ezrin's FERM domain and C408 in PALM2's CAAX motif were important for PALM2/ezrin interaction and ezrin activation. Knockout of ezrin prevented enhanced cancer cell migration by PALM2 overexpression. PALM2, depending on its prenylation, increased both ezrin membrane localization and phosphorylation of ezrin at Y146. In summary, prenylated PALM2 enhances the migration of cancer cells by activating ezrin. Interaction of farnesylated PRL-2, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase, with the beta-subunit of geranylgeranyltransferase II.

Co-expression of the alpha-subunit (alpha) of GGT II, betaGGT II, and PRL-2 resulted in alpha/betaGGT II heterodimer formation and prevented PRL-2 binding. Expression of PRL-2 alone inhibited the endogenous alpha/betaGGT II activity in HeLa cells. Together, these results indicate that the binding of alphaGGT II and PRL-2 to betaGGT II is mutually exclusive, and suggest that PRL-2 may function as a regulator of GGT II activity.\nactivity and include a series of key regulatory proteins, such as RAS superfamily members, heterotrimeric G proteins, nuclear lamina protein, and several protein kinases and phosphatases. However, studies of prenylated proteins in esophageal cancer are limited. Here, through research on large-scale proteomic data of esophageal cancer in our laboratory, we found that paralemmin-2 (PALM2), a potential prenylated protein, was upregulated and associated with poor prognosis in patients. Low-throughput verification showed that the expression of PALM2 in esophageal cancer tissues was higher than that in their paired normal esophageal epithelial tissues, and it was generally expressed in the membrane and cytoplasm of esophageal cancer cells. PALM2 interacted with the two subunits of farnesyl transferase (FTase), FNTA and FNTB. Either the addition of an FTase inhibitor or mutation in the CAAX motif of PALM2 (PALM2C408S) impaired its membranous localization and reduced the membrane location of PALM2, indicating PALM2 was prenylated by FTase.\nTargeting RAS-converting enzyme 1 overcomes senescence and improves progeria-like phenotypes of ZMPSTE24 deficiency. Several progeroid disorders are caused by deficiency in the endoprotease ZMPSTE24 which leads to accumulation of prelamin A at the nuclear envelope. ZMPSTE24 cleaves prelamin A twice: at the third carboxyl-terminal amino acid following farnesylation of a -CSIM motif; and 15 residues upstream to produce mature lamin A. The carboxyl-terminal cleavage can also be performed by RAS-converting enzyme 1 (RCE1) but little is known about the importance of this cleavage for the ability of prelamin A to cause disease. Here, we found that knockout of RCE1 delayed senescence and increased proliferation of ZMPSTE24-deficient fibroblasts from a patient with non-classical Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), but did not influence proliferation of classical LMNA-mutant HGPS cells. Knockout of Rce1 in Zmpste24-deficient mice at postnatal week 4-5 increased body weight and doubled the median survival time. The absence of Rce1 in\nZmpste24-deficient mice at postnatal week 4-5 increased body weight and doubled the median survival time. The absence of Rce1 in Zmpste24-deficient fibroblasts did not influence nuclear shape but reduced an interaction between prelamin A and AKT which activated AKT-mTOR signaling and was required for the increased proliferation. Prelamin A levels increased in Rce1-deficient cells due to a slower turnover rate but its localization at the nuclear rim was unaffected. These results strengthen the idea that the presence of misshapen nuclei does not prevent phenotype improvement and suggest that targeting RCE1 might be useful for treating the rare progeroid disorders associated with ZMPSTE24 deficiency.

Hyaluronidases are enzymes that degrade hyaluronan, an important component of the extracellular matrix. The mammalian hyaluronidases are considered to be involved in many (patho)physiological processes like fertilization, tumor growth, and metastasis. Bacterial hyaluronidases, also termed hyaluronate lyases, contribute to the spreading of microorganisms in tissues. Such roles for hyaluronidases suggest that inhibitors could be useful pharmacological tools. Potent and selective inhibitors are not known to date, although L-ascorbic acid has been reported to be a weak inhibitor of Streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase (SpnHL). The x-ray structure of SpnHL complexed with L-ascorbic acid has been elucidated suggesting that additional hydrophobic interactions might increase inhibitory activity.

Vcpal showed strong inhibition of Streptococcus agalactiae hyaluronate lyase with an\ninhibitor of both streptococcal and bovine testicular hyaluronidase (BTH). Vcpal showed strong inhibition of Streptococcus agalactiae hyaluronate lyase with an IC(50) of 4 microM and weaker inhibition of SpnHL and BTH with IC(50) values of 100 and 56 microM, respectively. To date, Vcpal has proved to be one of the most potent inhibitors of hyaluronidase. We also determined the x-ray structure of the SpnHL-Vcpal complex and confirmed the hypothesis that additional hydrophobic interactions with Phe-343, His-399, and Thr-400 in the active site led to increased inhibition. A homology structural model of BTH was also generated to suggest binding modes of Vcpal to this hyaluronidase. The long alkyl chain seemed to interact with an extended, hydrophobic channel formed by mostly conserved amino acids Ala-84, Leu-91, Tyr-93, Tyr-220, and Leu-344 in BTH. Acidic hyaluronidase activity is present in mouse sperm and is reduced in the absence of SPAM1: evidence for a role\npurity by SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC. The physicochemical tests included optimum pH, heat stability, presence of isoforms, neutralization by flavonoids and assessment of commercial antivenoms. Hyase was purified and presented a specific activity of 148 turbidity-reducing units (TRU)/mg (venom: 36 TRU/mg; purification factor of ~4). Hyase displayed a molecular mass of 43 kDa by SDS-PAGE. Zymography in hyaluronic-acid-containing gels indicated an absence of enzyme isoforms. The optimum pH was 4-5, with highest activity at 37\u00b0C. Hyase was stable up to 60\u00b0C; but its activity was lost at higher temperatures and maintained after several freeze-thaw cycles. The NaCl concentration (up to 1 M) did not influence activity. Hyase had greater action towards hyaluronic acid compared to chondroitin sulfate, and was completely neutralized by polyvalent antiarachnid sera, but not by caterpillar, scorpion or snakes antivenoms.CONCLUSION: The neutralization by arachnid but not scorpion antivenom indicates that this enzyme shares antigenic epitopes with similar enzymes\nhyase activity. This activity is associated with in vitro cumulus penetration, since antibody inhibition of Hyalp1 significantly (P = .034) retarded the rate of penetration of wild-type (WT) sperm. Antibody-inhibited Spam1 null sperm were more severely retarded (P = 4.2 x 10(-19)), suggesting an up-regulation of Hyalp1 in these mice. A functionality test of the hyaluronic acid (HA) receptor domain identified in the N-terminus by in silico analysis revealed that sperm Hyalp1 is significantly (P = .006) involved in the progesterone-induced HA-enhanced acrosome reaction. Finally, developmental reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) shows that testicular transcripts of Hyalp1 are detected as early as 6 days postparturition, similar to transcripts for Spam1, suggesting that the gene might also play a role in the developing testes prior to spermiogenesis. Taken together, the findings reveal that Hyalp1 likely has a unique function in the adult testis, and redundant overlapping ones with Spam1 and\nand/or serve redundant roles. Unsolved problems include functional redundancy, which can be addressed by double gene-knockouts, and identifying the murine hyase(s) involved in zona binding or whether this role shows species specificity. Hyalp1 in murine sperm function: evidence for unique and overlapping functions with other reproductive hyaluronidases. While Sperm adhesion molecule 1 (SPAM1) is the highly conserved mammalian sperm hyaluronidase (hyase), multiple hyases are present in the mouse testis. In this study we show that one of the murine hyases, Hyalp1, which is predominantly expressed in the testis in a 24-kd isoform has neutral enzymatic activity. On sperm, Hyalp1 is localized on the plasma membrane of the anterior head and was shown to have neutral hyase activity for an isoform of approximately 55-56 kd, contributing modestly to the overall neutral hyase activity. This activity is associated with in vitro cumulus penetration, since antibody inhibition of Hyalp1 significantly (P = .034)\nmembrane over the head and midpiece. Mouse isoforms are differentially distributed in the soluble (SAP), membrane (MBP), and acrosome-reacted (AR) fraction where they are most abundant. Comparisons of zymography of Hyal3 null and wild-type (WT) AR and MBP fractions show significant HYAL3 activity at pH 3 and 4, and less at pH 7. At pH 4, a second acid-active hyase band at approximately 57 kDa is present in the AR fraction. HYAL3 activity was confirmed using immunoprecipitated HYAL3 and spectrophotometry. In total proteins, hyase activity was higher at pH 6 than at 4, where Spam1 nulls had significantly (P < 0.01) diminished activity implicating an acidic optima for murine SPAM1. Although fully fertile, Hyal3 null sperm showed delayed cumulus penetration and reduced acrosomal exocytosis. HYAL3 is expressed in epididymal tissue/fluid, from where it is acquired by caudal mouse sperm in vitro. Our results reveal concerted activity of both neutral- and\nin fertilization. While sperm adhesion molecule-1 (SPAM1), which has neutral and acidic (bimodal) activity, is the widely conserved mammalian sperm hyase, it co-exists with an acidic hyase in murine and human spermatozoa. Thus, sperm function depends on the concerted activity of both germ cell and 'somatic' hyases. Some hyases are in low abundance in the ovary, somatic testicular cells, the male accessory organs and the male and female genital tracts where they are secreted and acquired by spermatozoa. The latter opens up the possibility of treating hyase-deficient spermatozoa via assisted reproductive technology. The findings challenge the existing classification of hyases, and support the notion that hyase activities are polygenic traits controlled by as many as five hyase genes in mice. Multiple sperm hyases may function cooperatively in a quantitative system and/or serve redundant roles. Unsolved problems include functional redundancy, which can be addressed by double gene-knockouts, and identifying the murine\nfindings reveal that Hyalp1 likely has a unique function in the adult testis, and redundant overlapping ones with Spam1 and may compensate for it in Spam1 null mice. Purification and characterization of a hyaluronidase from venom of the spider Vitalius dubius (Araneae, Theraphosidae). BACKGROUND: Venom hyaluronidase (Hyase) contributes to the diffusion of venom from the inoculation site. In this work, we purified and characterized Hyase from the venom of Vitalius dubius (Araneae, Theraphosidae), a large theraphosid found in southeastern Brazil. Venom obtained by electrical stimulation of adult male and female V. dubius was initially fractionated by gel filtration on a Superdex\u00ae 75 column. Active fractions were pooled and applied to a heparin-sepharose affinity column. The proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient.RESULTS: Active fractions were pooled and assessed for purity by SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC. The physicochemical tests included optimum pH, heat stability, presence of isoforms, neutralization by flavonoids and\nAcidic hyaluronidase activity is present in mouse sperm and is reduced in the absence of SPAM1: evidence for a role for hyaluronidase 3 in mouse and human sperm. The molecular mechanisms underlying sperm penetration of the physical barriers surrounding the oocyte have not been completely delineated. Although neutral-active or \"reproductive\" hyaluronidases (hyases), exemplified by Sperm Adhesion Molecule 1 (SPAM1), are thought to be responsible for hyaluronan digestion in the egg vestments and for sperm-zona binding, their roles in mouse sperm have been recently questioned. Here we report that acidic \"somatic\" Hyaluronidase 3 (HYAL3), a homolog of SPAM1 with 74.6% structural similarity, exists in two isoforms in human ( approximately 47 and approximately 55 kDa) and mouse ( approximately 44 and approximately 47 kDa) sperm, where it resides on the plasma membrane over the head and midpiece. Mouse isoforms are differentially distributed in the soluble (SAP), membrane (MBP), and acrosome-reacted (AR)\n(RA) SF. SF was digested with hyaluronidase (hyase) and its effect on adhesion was observed using confocal microscopy. MRI and microscopy were used to image autologous dual-labelled MSCs in an in vivo canine model of KJD. SF-HA was investigated using gel electrophoresis and densitometry.RESULTS: Osteoarthritic-synovial fluid (OA-SF) and purified high molecular weight (MW) HA inhibited SF-MSC adhesion to plastic, while hyase treatment of OA-SF but not RA-SF significantly increased MSC adhesion to cartilage (3.7-fold, p<0.05) These differences were linked to the SF mediated HA-coat which was larger in OA-SF than in RA-SF. OA-SF contained >9 MDa HA and this correlated with increases in adhesion (r=0.880). In the canine KJD model, MSC adhesion to cartilage was evident and also dependent on HA MW.CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight an unappreciated role of SF-HA on MSC interactions and provide proof of concept that endogenous SF-MSCs are capable of adhering to cartilage in a favourable\nfrom where it is acquired by caudal mouse sperm in vitro. Our results reveal concerted activity of both neutral- and acid-active hyaluronidases in sperm. Synovial fluid hyaluronan mediates MSC attachment to cartilage, a potential novel mechanism contributing to cartilage repair in osteoarthritis using knee joint distraction. OBJECTIVES: Knee joint distraction (KJD) is a novel, but poorly understood, treatment for osteoarthritis (OA) associated with remarkable 'spontaneous' cartilage repair in which resident synovial fluid (SF) multipotential mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may play a role. We hypothesised that SF hyaluronic acid (HA) inhibited the initial interaction between MSCs and cartilage, a key first step to integration, and postulate that KJD environment favoured MSC/cartilage interactions.METHODS: Attachment of dual-labelled SF-MSCs were assessed in a novel in vitro human cartilage model using OA and rheumatoid arthritic (RA) SF. SF was digested with hyaluronidase (hyase) and its effect on adhesion was observed using confocal microscopy. MRI and\nsnakes antivenoms.CONCLUSION: The neutralization by arachnid but not scorpion antivenom indicates that this enzyme shares antigenic epitopes with similar enzymes in other spider venoms. The biochemical properties of this Hyase are comparable to others described.\non MSC interactions and provide proof of concept that endogenous SF-MSCs are capable of adhering to cartilage in a favourable biochemical and biomechanical environment in OA distracted joints, offering novel one-stage strategies towards joint repair. Germ-cell hyaluronidases: their roles in sperm function. Hyaluronidases (hyases) are a family of enzymes that catalyse the breakdown of hyaluronic acid (HA), which is abundant in the extracellular matrix. Two unlinked gene clusters encode these six proteins: three each in the somatic (or ubiquitous) acid-active subgroup and the neutral-active germ-cell subgroup. This review analyses the data on the expression and role of hyases in gamete biology and fertilization, using electronic databases until October 2010. Evidence indicates that hyases are membrane proteins with multifunctional essential, enzymatic and non-enzymatic, roles (cumulus penetration, zona binding and HA receptor) in fertilization.

For a better understanding of their physiological functions in molybdate homeostasis, we studied the impact of mot1.1 and mot1.2 knock-out mutants, including a double knock-out on molybdate uptake and Moco-dependent enzyme activity, MOT localisation, and protein-protein interactions. The outcome illustrates different physiological roles for Moco biosynthesis: MOT1.1 is plasma membrane located and its function lies in the efficient absorption of molybdate from soil and its distribution throughout the plant. However, MOT1.1 is not involved in leaf cell imports of molybdate and has no interaction with proteins of the Moco biosynthesis complex. In contrast, the tonoplast-localised transporter MOT1.2 exports molybdate stored in the vacuole and makes it available for re-localisation during senescence. It also supplies the Moco biosynthesis complex with molybdate by direct interaction with molybdenum insertase Cnx1 for controlled and safe sequestering.\nand mdm-2 in mot-2-transfected cells only. Furthermore, NIH 3T3 cells transfected with expression plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein-tagged mot-2 but not mot-1 showed an abrogation of nuclear translocation of wild-type p53. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism of p53 inactivation by mot-2 protein. Physiological Importance of Molybdate Transporter Family 1 in Feeding the Molybdenum Cofactor Biosynthesis Pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. Molybdate uptake and molybdenum cofactor (Moco) biosynthesis were investigated in detail in the last few decades. The present study critically reviews our present knowledge about eukaryotic molybdate transporters (MOT) and focuses on the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, complementing it with new experiments, filling missing gaps, and clarifying contradictory results in the literature. Two molybdate transporters, MOT1.1 and MOT1.2, are known in Arabidopsis, but their importance for sufficient molybdate supply to Moco biosynthesis remains unclear. For a better understanding of their physiological functions in molybdate homeostasis, we studied the impact of\na moonlighting function, since clear evidence of molybdate transport was found in a yeast-system. Our characterization of the MOT2-family and the detection of a glutathione-molybdate complex unveil the plant-wide way of molybdate. Functional significance of point mutations in stress chaperone mortalin and their relevance to Parkinson disease. Mortalin/mtHsp70/Grp75 (mot-2), a heat shock protein 70 family member, is an essential chaperone, enriched in cancers, and has been shown to possess pro-proliferative and anti-apoptosis functions. An allelic form of mouse mortalin (mot-1) that differs by two amino acids, M618V and G624R, in the C terminus substrate-binding domain has been reported. Furthermore, genome sequencing of mortalin from Parkinson disease patients identified two missense mutants, R126W and P509S. In the present study, we investigated the significance of these mutations in survival, proliferation, and oxidative stress tolerance in human cells. Using mot-1 and mot-2 recombinant proteins and specific antibodies, we performed screening to find their\nMoonlighting Arabidopsis molybdate transporter 2 family and GSH-complex formation facilitate molybdenum homeostasis. Molybdenum (Mo) as essential micronutrient for plants, acts as active component of molybdenum cofactor (Moco). Core metabolic processes like nitrate assimilation or abscisic-acid biosynthesis rely on Moco-dependent enzymes. Although a family of molybdate transport proteins (MOT1) is known to date in Arabidopsis, molybdate homeostasis remained unclear. Here we report a second family of molybdate transporters (MOT2) playing key roles in molybdate distribution and usage. KO phenotype-analyses, cellular and organ-specific localization, and connection to Moco-biosynthesis enzymes via protein-protein interaction suggest involvement in cellular import of molybdate in leaves and reproductive organs. Furthermore, we detected a glutathione-molybdate complex, which reveals how vacuolar storage is maintained. A putative Golgi S-adenosyl-methionine transport function was reported recently for the MOT2-family. Here, we propose a moonlighting function, since clear evidence of molybdate transport was found in a yeast-system. Our characterization of the MOT2-family and\nstress tolerance in human cells. Using mot-1 and mot-2 recombinant proteins and specific antibodies, we performed screening to find their binding proteins and then identified ribosomal protein L-7 (RPL-7) and elongation factor-1 \u03b1 (EF-1\u03b1), which differentially bind to mot-1 and mot-2, respectively. We demonstrate that mot-1, R126W, or P509S mutant (i) lacks mot-2 functions involved in carcinogenesis, such as p53 inactivation and hTERT/hnRNP-K (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K) activation; (ii) causes increased level of endogenous oxidative stress; (iii) results in decreased tolerance of cells to exogenous oxidative stress; and (iv) shows differential binding and impact on the RPL-7 and EF-1\u03b1 proteins. These factors may mediate the transformation of longevity/pro-proliferative function of mot-2 to the premature aging/anti-proliferative effect of mutants, and hence may have significance in cellular aging, Parkinson disease pathology, and prognosis.

The mortalin genes, mot-1 and mot-2, are hsp70 family members that were originally cloned from normal and immortal murine cells, respectively. Their proteins differ by only two amino acid residues but exhibit different subcellular localizations, arise from two distinct genes, and have contrasting biological activities. We report here that the two proteins also differ in their interactions with the tumor suppressor protein p53. The pancytosolic mot-1 protein in normal cells did not show colocalization with p53; in contrast, nonpancytosolic mot-2 and p53 overlapped significantly in immortal cells. Transfection of mot-2 but not mot-1 resulted in the repression of p53-mediated transactivation in p53-responsive reporter assays. Inactivation of p53 by mot-2 was supported by the down-regulation of p53-responsive genes p21(WAF-1) and mdm-2 in mot-2-transfected cells only.

Among them, oridonin is accumulated in the leaves, and is the most frequently studied compound because of its antitumor and antibacterial activities. We have identified five copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS) and six kaurene synthase-like (KSL) genes by transcriptome profiling of Isodon rubescens leaves. An in vitro assay assigns ten of them to five different diterpene biosynthesis pathways, except IrCPS3 that has a mutation in the catalytic motif. The Lamiaceae-specific clade genes (IrCPS1 and IrCPS2) synthesize the intermediate copalyl diphosphate (normal-CPP), while IrCPS4 and IrCPS5 synthesize the intermediate ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CPP). IrKSL2, IrKSL4, and IrKSL5 react with ent-CPP to produce an ent-isopimaradiene-like compound, ent-atiserene and ent-kaurene, respectively. Correspondingly, the Lamiaceae-specific clade genes IrKSL1 or IrKSL3 combined with normal-CPP led to the formation of miltiradiene. The compound then underwent aromatization and oxidization with\nof the two interacting cyclase domains in ent-kaurene synthase from the fungus Phaeosphaeria sp.

We report here kinetic analysis and identification of the two cyclase domains in a bifunctional diterpene cyclase, Phaeosphaeria ent-kaurene synthase (FCPS/KS). Kinetics of a recombinant FCPS/KS protein indicated that the affinity for copalyl diphosphate is higher than that for geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP). ent-Kaurene production from GGDP by FCPS/KS was enhanced by the addition of a plant ent-kaurene synthase (KS) but not by plant CDP synthase (CPS), suggesting that the rate of ent-kaurene production of FCPS/KS may be limited by the KS activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of aspartate-rich motifs in FCPS/KS indicated that the (318)DVDD motif near the N terminus and the (656)DEFFE motif near the C terminus may be part of the active site for the CPS and KS reactions, respectively. The other aspartate-rich (132)DDVLD motif near the\nthe content of tanshinone I and tanshinone IIA, which were 11.09 and 33.37 times of the control, respectively. Moreover, SmWRKY61 had a strong regulatory effect, elevating the expression levels of tanshinone pathway genes such as DXS2, CMK, HMGS2, 1, KSL1, KSL2, CYP76AH1, and CYP76AK3. For the WRKY family, 79 SmWRKYs were originally obtained and classified into three main groups. Collinearity analysis indicated a more specific extension of WRKY gene family in Salvia genus. In 55 Salvia species, only 37 species contained the WRKY61 sequence, and high SmWRKY61 expression in some Salvia L. species was often accompanied by high tanshinone accumulation. The above results suggest that SmWRKY61 is a highly effective regulator of tanshinone accumulation and may be a key factor resulting in high tanshinone accumulation in S. castanea. Functional analysis of the two interacting cyclase domains in ent-kaurene synthase from the fungus Phaeosphaeria sp. L487 and a comparison with cyclases\nhas not been characterized. The two compounds are biosynthesized from the universal diterpenoid precursor (E,E,E)-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) by diterpene synthases, which have been discovered and functionally characterized in T. wilfordii. Here, we described the functional characterization of four cytochrome P450 reductases (TwCPR) and one ent-kaurene oxidase (TwKO). Four TwCPRs were found to have relatively ubiquitous expression in T. wilfordii root, stem, leaf, and flower tissues. Co-expression of both a TwCPR and TwKO in yeast showed that TwCPR3 has a slightly better activity for providing the electrons required for these reactions, indicating that TwCPR3 is more suitable for use in the functional analysis of other cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. TwKO catalyzed the three-step oxidation of the C4\u03b1 methyl of the tetracyclic diterpene intermediate ent-kaurene to form ent-kaurenoic acid as an early step in GA biosynthesis. Notably, TwKO could also convert 16\u03b1-hydroxy-ent-kaurane to 16\u03b1-hydroxy-ent-kaurenoic acid, indicating an important function of 16\u03b1-hydroxy-ent-kaurane in the\nIrKSL1 or IrKSL3 combined with normal-CPP led to the formation of miltiradiene. The compound then underwent aromatization and oxidization with a cytochrome P450 forming two related compounds, abietatriene and ferruginol, which were detected in the root bark. IrKSL6 reacts with normal-CPP to produce isopimaradiene. IrKSL3 and IrKSL6 have the \u03b3\u03b2\u03b1 tridomain structure, as these proteins tend to possess the bidomain structure of IrKSL1, highlighting the evolutionary history of KSL gene domain loss and further elucidating chemical diversity evolution from a macroevolutionary stance in Lamiaceae. Probing the Single Key Amino Acid Responsible for the Novel Catalytic Function of ent-Kaurene Oxidase Supported by NADPH-Cytochrome P450 Reductases in Tripterygium wilfordii. Tripterygium wilfordii produces not only ent-kaurene, which is an intermediate of gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis in flowering plants, but also 16\u03b1-hydroxy-ent-kaurane, whose physiological role has not been characterized. The two compounds are biosynthesized from the universal diterpenoid precursor (E,E,E)-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) by diterpene synthases,\nin GA biosynthesis. Notably, TwKO could also convert 16\u03b1-hydroxy-ent-kaurane to 16\u03b1-hydroxy-ent-kaurenoic acid, indicating an important function of 16\u03b1-hydroxy-ent-kaurane in the anti-HIV principle tripterifordin biosynthetic pathway in planta. Homology modeling and molecular docking were used to investigate the unknown crucial active amino acid residue involved in the catalytic reaction of TwKO, and one key residue (Leu387) contributed to the formation of 16\u03b1-hydroxy-ent-kaurenoic acid, most likely by forming hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group (-OH) of 16\u03b1-hydroxy-ent-kaurane, which laid the basis for further investigation of the multifunctional nature of KO catalysis. Also, our findings paved the way for the complete biosynthesis of the anti-HIV principle tripterifordin. Integrated Transcriptomics and Proteomics to Reveal Regulation Mechanism and Evolution of SmWRKY61 on Tanshinone Biosynthesis in Salvia miltiorrhiza and Salvia castanea. Tanshinones found in Salvia species are the main active compounds for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, but their contents are hugely different in\nare the main active compounds for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, but their contents are hugely different in different species. For example, tanshinone IIA content in Salvia castanea Diels f. tomentosa Stib. is about 49 times higher than that in Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge. The molecular mechanism responsible for this phenomenon remains largely unknown. To address this, we performed comparative transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of S. miltiorrhiza and S. castanea. A total of 296 genes in S. castanea and 125 genes in S. miltiorrhiza were highly expressed at both the transcriptional and proteome levels, including hormone signal regulation, fungus response genes, transcription factors, and CYP450. Among these differentially expressed genes, the expression of SmWRKY61 was particularly high in S. castanea. Overexpression of SmWRKY61 in S. miltiorrhiza could significantly increase the content of tanshinone I and tanshinone IIA, which were 11.09 and 33.37 times of the control, respectively. Moreover, SmWRKY61\nbe part of the active site for the CPS and KS reactions, respectively. The other aspartate-rich (132)DDVLD motif near the N terminus is thought to be involved in both reactions. Functional analysis of the N- and C-terminal truncated mutants revealed that a N-terminal 59-kDa polypeptide catalyzed the CPS reaction and a C-terminal 66-kDa polypeptide showed KS activity. A 101-kDa polypeptide lacking the first 43 amino acids of the N terminus reduced KS activity severely without CPS activity. These results indicate that there are two separate interacting domains in the 106-kDa polypeptide of FCPS/KS.",

        "desc": "result of limited knowledge about E3 ligase-regulated ubiquitination. RNF170 protein, an endoplasmic reticulum membrane ubiquitin ligase, mediates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor ubiquitination and degradation. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) receptors are endoplasmic reticulum membrane calcium channels that, upon activation, are degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. While searching for novel mediators of IP(3) receptor processing, we discovered that RNF170, an uncharacterized RING domain-containing protein, associates rapidly with activated IP(3) receptors. RNF170 is predicted to have three membrane-spanning helices, is localized to the ER membrane, and possesses ubiquitin ligase activity. Depletion of endogenous RNF170 by RNA interference inhibited stimulus-induced IP(3) receptor ubiquitination, and degradation and overexpression of a catalytically inactive RNF170 mutant suppressed stimulus-induced IP(3) receptor processing. A substantial proportion of RNF170 is constitutively associated with the erlin1/2 (SPFH1/2) complex, which has been shown previously to bind to IP(3) receptors immediately after their activation. Depletion of RNF170 did not affect the binding of the erlin1/2\nis not a substrate of ubiquitin ligase RNF122, but that, instead, it stabilizes RNF122.CONCLUSIONS: RNF122 can be characterized as a C3H2C3-type RING finger-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase localized to the ER. RNF122 promotes its own degradation in a RING finger-and proteasome-dependent manner. RNF122 interacts with CAML, and its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity was noted to be dependent on the RING finger domain. Stealing the spotlight: CUL4-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase docks WD40-repeat proteins to destroy Recent investigation of Cullin 4 (CUL4) has ushered this class of multiprotein ubiquitin E3 ligases to center stage as critical regulators of diverse processes including cell cycle regulation, developmental patterning, DNA replication, DNA damage and repair, and epigenetic control of gene expression. CUL4 associates with DNA Damage Binding protein 1 (DDB1) to assemble an ubiquitin E3 ligase that targets protein substrates for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. CUL4 ligase activity is also regulated by the covalent attachment of the ubiquitin-like protein\nfor spermiogenesis at the elongating spermatid stage. Spermatids from Ube2j1 KO male mice are believed to have defects in the dislocation step of ER quality control. However, associated E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases that function during spermatogenesis remain unknown.RESULTS: We identified four evolutionarily conserved testis-specific E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases [RING finger protein 133 (Rnf133); RING finger protein 148 (Rnf148); RING finger protein 151 (Rnf151); and Zinc finger SWIM-type containing 2 (Zswim2)]. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we generated and analyzed the fertility of mutant mice with null alleles for each of these E3-encoding genes, as well as double and triple knockout (KO) mice. Male fertility, male reproductive organ, and sperm-associated parameters were analyzed in detail. Fecundity remained largely unaffected in Rnf148, Rnf151, and Zswim2 KO males; however, Rnf133 KO males displayed severe subfertility. Additionally, Rnf133 KO sperm exhibited abnormal morphology and reduced motility. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated that cytoplasmic droplets were retained in Rnf133 KO\nto activate IRF3 and NF-\u03baB signaling, initiating innate immune responses. The ubiquitination of TLR3 downstream signaling molecules and their roles in the innate response have been discovered; however, whether TLR3 itself is ubiquitinated and then functionally involved remains to be elucidated. By immunoprecipitating TLR3-binding proteins in macrophages, we identified ring finger protein 170 (RNF170) as a TLR3-binding E3 ligase. RNF170 mediated the K48-linked polyubiquitination of K766 in the TIR domain of TLR3 and promoted the degradation of TLR3 through the proteasome pathway. The genetic ablation of RNF170 selectively augmented TLR3-triggered innate immune responses both in vitro and in vivo. Our results reveal a novel role for RNF170 in selectively inhibiting TLR3-triggered innate immune responses by promoting TLR3 degradation. A new scheme to discover functional associations and regulatory networks of E3 ubiquitin ligases. BACKGROUND: Protein ubiquitination catalyzed by E3 ubiquitin ligases play important modulatory roles in various biological processes. With the\nindicative of a functional defect at the IP3 receptor locus, which may be the cause of neurodegeneration. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic deletion of RNF170 showed that RNF170 mediates the addition of all of the ubiquitin conjugates known to become attached to activated IP3 receptors (monoubiquitin and Lys(48)- and Lys(63)-linked ubiquitin chains), and that wild-type and mutant RNF170 have apparently identical ubiquitin ligase activities toward IP3 receptors. Thus, the Ca(2+) mobilization defect seen in ADSA lymphoblasts is apparently not due to aberrant IP3 receptor ubiquitination. Rather, the defect likely reflects abnormal ubiquitination of other substrates, or adaptation to the chronic reduction in RNF170 levels. E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF170 inhibits innate immune responses by targeting and degrading TLR3 in murine cells. Upon recognition of dsRNA, toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) recruits the adaptor protein TRIF to activate IRF3 and NF-\u03baB signaling, initiating innate immune responses. The ubiquitination of TLR3 downstream signaling molecules and their roles\nto bind to IP(3) receptors immediately after their activation. Depletion of RNF170 did not affect the binding of the erlin1/2 complex to stimulated IP(3) receptors, whereas erlin1/2 complex depletion inhibited RNF170 binding. These results suggest a model in which the erlin1/2 complex recruits RNF170 to activated IP(3) receptors where it mediates IP(3) receptor ubiquitination. Thus, RNF170 plays an essential role in IP(3) receptor processing via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Physical and genetic associations of the Irc20 ubiquitin ligase with Cdc48 and SUMO. A considerable percentage of the genome is dedicated to the ubiquitin-proteasome system, with the yeast genome predicted to encode approximately 100 ubiquitin ligases (or E3s), and the human genome predicted to encode more than 600 E3s. The most abundant class of E3s consists of RING finger-containing proteins. Although many insights have been obtained regarding the structure and catalytic mechanism of the E3s, much remains to be learned about the\nUV-damaged DNA sites Histone H3 and H4 ubiquitylation by the CUL4-DDB-ROC1 ubiquitin ligase facilitates cellular response to DNA damage Structure and E3-ligase activity of the Ring-Ring complex of polycomb proteins Bmi1 and Ring1b The human homologue for the Caenorhabditis elegans cul-4 gene is amplified and overexpressed in primary breast cancers TFDP1, CUL4A, and CDC16 identified as targets for amplification at 13q34 in hepatocellular carcinomas Isolation, characterization, and partial purification of a novel ubiquitin-protein ligase, E3. Targeting of protein substrates via multiple and distinct recognition signals and conjugating enzymes. Degradation of a protein via the ubiquitin system involves two discrete steps, conjugation of ubiquitin to the substrate and degradation of the adduct. Conjugation follows a three-step mechanism. First, ubiquitin is activated by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1. Following activation, one of several E2 enzymes (ubiquitin-carrier proteins or ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, UBCs) transfers ubiquitin from E1 to the protein substrate that is bound to\nhighly induced in viral infection, and ISG15 conjugation, termed ISGylation, plays important regulatory roles in viral growth. Although ISGylation has been shown to negatively affect many viruses, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), viral countermeasures that might modulate ISGylation are not well understood. In the present study, we show that the transmembrane protein encoded by HCMV UL50 inhibits ISGylation by causing proteasomal degradation of UBE1L, an E1-activating enzyme for ISGylation. This pUL50 activity requires membrane targeting. In support of this finding, RNF170, an ER-associated ubiquitin E3 ligase, interacts with pUL50 and promotes UL50-mediated UBE1L ubiquitination and degradation. Our results provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that viruses can regulate ISGylation by directly targeting the ISGylation E1 enzyme. Comprehensive database of human E3 ubiquitin ligases: application to aquaporin-2 regulation. Aquaporin-2 (AQP2) is regulated in part via vasopressin-mediated changes in protein half-life that are in turn dependent on AQP2 ubiquitination. Here we addressed\nE3 ubiquitination is impaired by IKK-driven phosphorylation remains unclear. Here, we report that this phosphorylation impedes ITCH binding to its cognate E2 ubiquitin ligase, UbcH7. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genetic knockout to mimic the ITCH-UbcH7-inhibited state, we further show that genetic UbcH7 deficiency phenocopies ITCH phosphorylation in regulating RIPK2 ubiquitination. We conclude that phosphorylation can disrupt the binding of an E3 ubiquitin ligase to an E2-conjugating enzyme, leading to prolonged inflammatory signaling. To our knowledge, this is the first report of E3 ubiquitin ligase phosphorylation inhibiting E3 ligase activity by impairing E2-E3 complex formation. A Point Mutation in the Ubiquitin Ligase RNF170 That Causes Autosomal Dominant Sensory Ataxia Destabilizes the Protein and Impairs Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptor-mediated Ca2+ Signaling. RNF170 is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane ubiquitin ligase that contributes to the ubiquitination of activated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors, and also, when point mutated (arginine to cysteine at position 199), causes autosomal dominant sensory\nAn RNF11: Smurf2 complex mediates ubiquitination of the AMSH protein. RING-finger proteins play crucial roles in ubiquitination events involved in diverse cellular processes including signal transduction, differentiation and apoptosis. Most of the RING-finger proteins have E3-ubiquitin ligase activity. RNF11 is a small RING-finger protein and harbors a RING-H2 domain and a PY motif that could facilitate protein:protein interaction(s) involved in oncogenesis. To isolate RNF11 protein partners and determine its role in normal and cancer cells, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening. Among 18 in-frame positive clones, three were found to be ZBRK1, Eps15 and AMSH (associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM). ZBRK1 is a KRAB domain containing Zinc-finger protein and is known to repress target gene transcription in a BRCA1-dependent manner. Eps15 is monoubiquitinated and is part of an essential complex involved in the endocytosis of plasma membrane receptors via the clathrin-mediated internalization pathway. Recent studies have shown that\nand Smurf2. RNF11 therefore recruits AMSH to Smurf2 for ubiquitination, leading to its degradation by the 26S proteasome. The potential functions of RNF11-mediated degradation of AMSH in breast cancer are discussed. Znf179 E3 ligase-mediated TDP-43 polyubiquitination is involved in TDP-43- ubiquitinated inclusions (UBI) (+)-related neurodegenerative pathology. BACKGROUND: The brain predominantly expressed RING finger protein, Znf179, is known to be important for embryonic neuronal differentiation during brain development. Downregulation of Znf179 has been observed in motor neurons of adult mouse models for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), yet the molecular function of Znf179 in neurodegeneration has never been previously described. Znf179 contains the classical C3HC4 RING finger domain, and numerous proteins containing C3HC4 RING finger domain act as E3 ubiquitin ligases. Hence, we are interested to identify whether Znf179 possesses E3 ligase activity and its role in ALS neuropathy.METHODS: We used in vivo and in vitro ubiquitination assay to examine the E3\nactivity and its role in ALS neuropathy.METHODS: We used in vivo and in vitro ubiquitination assay to examine the E3 ligase autoubiquitination activity of Znf179 and its effect on 26S proteasome activity. To search for the candidate substrates of Znf179, we immunoprecipitated Znf179 and subjected to mass spectrometry (MS) analysis to identify its interacting proteins. We found that ALS/ FTLD-U (frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with ubiquitin inclusions)-related neurodegenerative TDP-43 protein is the E3 ligase substrate of Znf179. To further clarify the role of E3 ubiquitin ligase Znf179 in neurodegenerative TDP-43-UBI (ubiquitinated inclusions) (+) proteinopathy, the effect of Znf179-mediated TDP-43 polyubiquitination on TDP-43 protein stability, aggregate formation and nucleus/cytoplasm mislocalization were evaluated in vitro cell culture system and in vivo animal model.RESULTS: Here we report that Znf179 is a RING E3 ubiquitin ligase which possesses autoubiquitination feature and regulates 26S proteasome activity through modulating the protein expression levels of 19S/20S proteasome\nof these diseases, by classifying the E3 ubiquitin ligase types and categorizing the neurological signs. We focus on the Gigaxonin-E3 ligase, mutated in giant axonal neuropathy and present a comprehensive analysis of the spectrum of mutations and the recent biological models that permitted to uncover novel mechanisms of action. Then, we discuss the common functions shared by Gigaxonin and the other E3 ligases in cytoskeleton architecture, cell signaling and autophagy. In particular, we emphasize their pivotal roles in controlling multiple steps of the autophagy pathway. In light of the various targets and extending functions sustained by a single E3 ligase, we finally discuss the challenge in understanding the complex pathological cascade underlying disease and in designing therapeutic approaches that can apprehend this complexity. RNF122: a novel ubiquitin ligase associated with calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand. BACKGROUND: RNF122 is a recently discovered RING finger protein that is associated with HEK293T cell viability and\ndomains were manually curated. To characterize the regulatory networks among E3 ligases and ubiquitinated proteins, a well-established network viewer was utilized for the exploration of ubiquitination networks from 40892 protein-protein interactions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was demonstrated in a case study examining E3 ligases involved in the ubiquitination of tumor suppressor p53. In addition to Mdm2, a known regulator of p53, the investigation also revealed other potential E3 ligases that may participate in the ubiquitination of p53.CONCLUSION: Aside from the ability to facilitate comprehensive investigations of protein ubiquitination networks, by integrating information regarding protein-protein interactions and substrate specificities, the proposed method could discover potential E3 ligases for ubiquitinated proteins. Our strategy presents an efficient means for the preliminary screen of ubiquitination networks and overcomes the challenge as a result of limited knowledge about E3 ligase-regulated ubiquitination. RNF170 protein, an endoplasmic reticulum membrane ubiquitin ligase, mediates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor\npolyubiquitinate CDT1 in vitro. These genetic and biochemical studies established that CUL4-ROC1 ubiquitin E3 directly targets CDT1 for degradation in S phase or after UV or IR. Comparison of SCF prototype and CUL4 Although CUL4 was implicated in CDT1 degradation and other biological processes (see below), the composition and structure of CUL4 E3 ligase was only recently characterized. However, the homology between cullin E3 ligases suggest that the overall strategy of CUL4 E3 ligase for substrate selection may resemble that of SCF, or CUL1-assembled E3s, which usually serve as an architectural prototype for the rest of cullin family. SCF is named for three of its subunits: SKP1, CUL1/Cdc53, and an F-box protein. The fourth subunit, the small RING finger protein ROC1/RBX1/HRT1, cooperates with all cullins to recruit and activate E2. CUL1 organizes the substrate receptor and E2 recruitment modules at its amino (N) and carboxy (C) termini, respectively. Structurally, CUL1\nregulated in part via vasopressin-mediated changes in protein half-life that are in turn dependent on AQP2 ubiquitination. Here we addressed the question, \"What E3 ubiquitin ligase is most likely to be responsible for AQP2 ubiquitination?\" using large-scale data integration based on Bayes' rule. The first step was to bioinformatically identify all E3 ligase genes coded by the human genome. The 377 E3 ubiquitin ligases identified in the human genome, consisting predominant of HECT, RING, and U-box proteins, have been used to create a publically accessible and downloadable online database (https://hpcwebapps.cit.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/E3-ligases/). We also curated a second database of E3 ligase accessory proteins that included BTB domain proteins, cullins, SOCS-box proteins, and F-box proteins. Using Bayes' theorem to integrate information from multiple large-scale proteomic and transcriptomic datasets, we ranked these 377 E3 ligases with respect to their probability of interaction with AQP2. Application of Bayes' rule identified the E3 ligases most likely\nubiquitin ligase which possesses autoubiquitination feature and regulates 26S proteasome activity through modulating the protein expression levels of 19S/20S proteasome subunits. Our immunoprecipitation assay and MS analysis results revealed that the neuropathological TDP-43 protein is one of its E3 ligase substrate. Znf179 interactes with TDP-43 protein and mediates polyubiquitination of TDP-43 in vitro and in vivo. In neurodegenerative TDP-43 proteinopathy, we found that Znf179-mediated polyubiquitination of TDP-43 accelerates its protein turnover rate and attenuates insoluble pathologic TDP-43 aggregates, while knockout of Znf179 in mouse brain results in accumulation of insoluble TDP-43 and cytosolic TDP-43 inclusions in cortex, hippocampus and midbrain regions.CONCLUSIONS: Here we unveil the important role for the novel E3 ligase Znf179 in TDP-43-mediated neuropathy, and provide a potential therapeutic strategy for combating ALS/ FTLD-U neurodegenerative pathologies. Phosphorylation of the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase ITCH diminishes binding to its cognate E2 ubiquitin ligase. Heightened and extended inflammation underlies the\n(ie: WD40 repeats or leucine-rich repeats) for substrate binding. Thus, F-box proteins are tethered to the SCF core by SKP1 and recruit a spectrum of substrates through additional domains. E2 recruitment by all cullins relies on its tight interaction with the small RING finger protein ROC1. ROC1 is an essential and highly conserved RING-H2 protein, and harbors the ~70 AA RING finger domain. Through its RING finger, ROC1 is able to recruit and activate E2. DDB1 was found to interact with CUL4A and was subsequently shown to be the adaptor for CUL4 E3 ligase. As an adaptor protein of CUL4 ligase, loss of DDB1 compromises the proteolysis of a spectrum of CUL4 substrates in vivo, including CDT1 in response to UV, and CUL4 ubiquitination activity in vitro. DDB1 is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals, and is essential in mammals and Drosophila but not yeast. In fission yeast, Rik1 is\ncalcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand. BACKGROUND: RNF122 is a recently discovered RING finger protein that is associated with HEK293T cell viability and is overexpressed in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells. RNF122 owns a RING finger domain in C terminus and transmembrane domain in N terminus. However, the biological mechanism underlying RNF122 action remains unknown.RESULTS: In this study, we characterized RNF122 both biochemically and intracellularly in order to gain an understanding of its biological role. RNF122 was identified as a new ubiquitin ligase that can ubiquitinate itself and undergoes degradation in a RING finger-dependent manner. From a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML) as an RNF122-interacting protein. To examine the interaction between CAML and RNF122, we performed co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization experiments using intact cells. What is more, we found that CAML is not a substrate of ubiquitin ligase RNF122, but that, instead, it stabilizes RNF122.CONCLUSIONS: RNF122 can be characterized as a\ninsights have been obtained regarding the structure and catalytic mechanism of the E3s, much remains to be learned about the function of the individual E3s. Here we characterize IRC20, which encodes a dual RING- and Snf/Swi family ATPase domain-containing protein in yeast that has been implicated in DNA repair. We found that overexpression of IRC20 causes two transcription-associated phenotypes and demonstrate that the Irc20 RING domain possesses ubiquitin E3 activity in vitro. Two mass spectrometry approaches were undertaken to identify Irc20-associated proteins. Wild-type Irc20 associated with Cdc48, a AAA-ATPase that serves as an intermediary in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. A second approach using a RING mutant derivative of Irc20 detected increased association of the Irc20 mutant with SUMO. These findings provide a foundation for understanding the roles of Irc20 in transcription and DNA repair.

One of these small, drug-like molecules has been cocrystallized with MIF and binds to the active site for tautomerase activity. Molecular modeling also suggests that the other hit compounds can bind in a similar fashion. Kinetic and structural characterization of a heterohexamer 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase from Chloroflexus aurantiacus J-10-fl: implications for functional and structural diversity in the tautomerase superfamily . 4-Oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT) isozymes play prominent roles in the bacterial utilization of aromatic hydrocarbons as sole carbon sources. These enzymes catalyze the conversion of 2-hydroxy-2,4-hexadienedioate (or 2-hydroxymuconate) to 2-oxo-3-hexenedioate, where Pro-1 functions as a general base and shuttles a proton from the 2-hydroxyl group of the substrate to the C-5 position of the product. 4-OT, a homohexamer from Pseudomonas putida mt-2, is the most extensively studied 4-OT isozyme and the founding member of the tautomerase superfamily. A search of five thermophilic bacterial\nthe precise contribution of MIF-2 to immune physiology or pathology is unclear. Like MIF-1, MIF-2 has intrinsic keto-enol tautomerase activity and mediates biological functions by engaging the cognate, common MIF family receptor CD74. Evidence that the catalytic site of MIF family cytokines has a structural role in receptor binding has prompted exploration of tautomerase inhibitors as potential biological antagonists and therapeutic agents, although few catalytic inhibitors inhibit receptor activation. Here we describe the discovery and biochemical characterization of a selective small-molecule inhibitor of MIF-2. An in silico screen of 1.6 million compounds targeting the MIF-2 tautomerase site yielded several hits for potential catalytic inhibitors of MIF-2 and identified 4-(3-carboxyphenyl)-2,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (4-CPPC) as the most functionally potent compound. We found that 4-CPPC has an enzymatic IC50 of 27 \u03bcm and 17-fold selectivity for MIF-2 versus MIF-1. An in vitro binding assay for MIF-1/MIF-2 to the CD74 ectodomain (sCD74) indicated that 4-CPPC\non the PPI network. Furthermore, the sub-network showed that a hub protein CcpA jointed directly or indirectly many proteins related to \u03b3-PGA synthesis and regulation, such as PgsB, GltA, GltB, ProB, ProJ, YcgM and two signal transduction systems ComP-ComA and DegS-DegU. Thus, CcpA might play an important role in the regulation of \u03b3-PGA synthesis. This study therefore will facilitate the understanding of the complex cellular behaviors and mechanisms of \u03b3-PGA synthesis in B. licheniformis WX-02. A selective small-molecule inhibitor of macrophage migration inhibitory factor-2 (MIF-2), a MIF cytokine superfamily member, inhibits MIF-2 biological activity. Cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor-2 (MIF-2 or D-dopachrome tautomerase) is a recently characterized second member of the MIF cytokine superfamily in mammalian genomes. MIF-2 shares pro-inflammatory and tumorigenic properties with the clinical target MIF (MIF-1), but the precise contribution of MIF-2 to immune physiology or pathology is unclear. Like MIF-1, MIF-2 has intrinsic keto-enol tautomerase activity\nbetter inhibitors of MIF enzymatic and bioactivities compared to the aliphatic ones. For instance, the IC(50) inhibition of MIF tautomerase activity by aromatic amino acid Schiff base methyl esters was achieved at a concentration between 1.65 and 50 microM, suggesting a critical role for the additional binding of the aromatic residues within the vicinity of the active site. The most potent inhibitor of MIF tautomerase activity was 2-[(4-hydroxybenzylidene)amino]-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propionic acid methyl ester (8), with an IC(50) of 1.65 microM. We found that compound 8 binding to MIF active site resulted in the inhibition of MIF bioactivity in three established bioassays: ERK-1/2 MAP kinase activation, p53-dependent apoptosis, and proliferation of serum-starved cells. Compound 8 inhibited MIF interaction with its as yet unidentified cognate cell surface receptor as shown by flow cytometry, concluding a critical role for the tautomerase active site in receptor binding. Thus the inhibitory effect of compound 8 on MIF\nnot exhibit the low-level activity of another tautomerase superfamily member, the heterohexamer trans-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase (CaaD). Characterization of hh4-OT enables functional assignment of the related enzymes, highlights the diverse ways the beta-alpha-beta building block can be assembled into an active enzyme, and provides further insight into the molecular basis of the low-level CaaD activity in 4-OT. Pro-1 of macrophage migration inhibitory factor functions as a catalytic base in the phenylpyruvate tautomerase activity. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an important immunoregulatory molecule with a unique ability to suppress the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids. Although considered a cytokine, MIF possesses a three-dimensional structure and active site similar to those of 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase and 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate isomerase. Moreover, a number of catalytic activities have been defined for MIF. To gain insight into the role of catalysis in the biological function of MIF, we have begun to characterize the catalytic activities in more detail.\nhuman D-dopachrome tautomerase at 1.54 A resolution. D-Dopachrome tautomerase folds to form a homotrimer that has extensive contact between subunits by intersubunit beta-sheets. Its overall topology and trimeric formations are similar to those of human MIF. The N-terminal proline is located at the bottom of a positively charged pocket in which the conformations of Lys32 and Ser63 are highly conserved. These positively charged properties are also seen in the active site pocket of human MIF, bacterial 5-(carboxymethyl)-2-hydroxymuconate isomerase (CHMI), and 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT). A detailed comparison of these structures revealed significant differences in the environment around the potential active site, the intersubunit contacts, and charge distribution on the molecular surface. It can be concluded that these features are related to the physiological role and tautomerase activity of MIF and D-dopachrome tautomerase. The present structural study could be helpful for designing effective inhibitors that modulate immunoregulatory and hormone-like effects.\nThe enzyme, designated as fused 4-OT, functions as a 4-OT where the active site groups (Pro-1, Arg-39, Arg-76, Phe-115, Arg-127) mirror those in the canonical 4-OT from Pseudomonas putida mt-2. Inactivation by 2-oxo-3-pentynoate suggests that Pro-1 of fused 4-OT has a low p Ka enabling the prolyl nitrogen to function as a general base. A remarkable feature of the fused 4-OT is the absence of P3 rotational symmetry in the structure (1.5 \u00c5 resolution). The asymmetric arrangement of the trimer is not due to the fusion of the two \u03b2-\u03b1-\u03b2 building blocks because an engineered \"unfused\" variant that breaks the covalent bond between the two units (to generate a heterohexamer) assumes the same asymmetric oligomerization state. It remains unknown how the different active site configurations contribute to the observed overall activities and whether the asymmetry has a biological purpose or role in the evolution of TSF members. Crystal structure of\nselectivity for MIF-2 versus MIF-1. An in vitro binding assay for MIF-1/MIF-2 to the CD74 ectodomain (sCD74) indicated that 4-CPPC inhibits MIF-2-CD74 binding in a dose-dependent manner (0.01-10 \u03bcm) without influencing MIF-1-CD74 binding. Notably, 4-CPPC inhibited MIF-2-mediated activation of CD74 and reduced CD74-dependent signal transduction. These results open opportunities for development of more potent and pharmacologically auspicious MIF-2 inhibitors to investigate the distinct functions of this MIF family member in vivo. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is rendered enzymatically inactive by myeloperoxidase-derived oxidants but retains its immunomodulatory function. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an important player in the regulation of the inflammatory response. Elevated plasma MIF is found in sepsis, arthritis, cystic fibrosis and atherosclerosis. Immunomodulatory activities of MIF include the ability to promote survival and recruitment of inflammatory cells and to amplify pro-inflammatory cytokine production. MIF has an unusual nucleophilic N-terminal proline with catalytic tautomerase activity. It remains\nthe most extensively studied 4-OT isozyme and the founding member of the tautomerase superfamily. A search of five thermophilic bacterial genomes identified a coded amino acid sequence in each that had been annotated as a tautomerase-like protein but lacked Pro-1. However, a nearby sequence has Pro-1, but the sequence is not annotated as a tautomerase-like protein. To characterize this group of proteins, two genes from Chloroflexus aurantiacus J-10-fl were cloned, and the corresponding proteins were expressed. Kinetic, biochemical, and X-ray structural analyses show that the two expressed proteins form a functional heterohexamer 4-OT (hh4-OT), composed of three alphabeta dimers. Like the P. putida enzyme, hh4-OT requires the amino-terminal proline and two arginines for the conversion of 2-hydroxymuconate to the product, implicating an analogous mechanism. In contrast to 4-OT, hh4-OT does not exhibit the low-level activity of another tautomerase superfamily member, the heterohexamer trans-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase (CaaD). Characterization of hh4-OT enables\nfour hits were identified with MDS and pharmacophore filtering with minimal overlap between the hits from each approach. Six hits were identified with IC50 values lower than 10 microM (three hits with IC50 lower than 1 microM); four were shown to be suicide inhibitors and act via covalent modification of the N-terminal catalytic residues Pro1. One additional inhibitor, N-phenyl-N-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl-thiourea, (IC50=300 nM) was obtained from FlexX docking combined to pharmacophoric filtering on one of the eight MD structures. These results demonstrate the power of integrative in silico approaches in the discovery of new modulator of MIF's tautomerase activity. The chemical diversity and mode of action of these compounds suggest that they could be used as molecular probes to elucidate the functions and biology of MIF and as lead candidates in drug developments of anti-MIF drugs. A tautomerase-null macrophage migration-inhibitory factor (MIF) gene knock-in mouse model reveals that protein interactions and not\nis the first study to focus on MIF-specific fully-human antibody fragment with a tautomerase-inhibitory effect that has potential to be developed as anti-inflammatory biomolecules for human use. X-ray structure of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase family member Homo sapiens FLJ36880. The human protein FLJ36880 belongs to the fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase family. The X-ray structure of FLJ36880 has been determined to 2.2 A resolution employing the semi-automated high-throughput structural genomics approach of the Protein Structure Factory. FLJ36880 adopts a mixed beta-sandwich roll fold and forms homodimers in crystals as well as in solution. One Mg2+ ion is bound to each subunit of the dimeric protein by coordination to three carboxylate oxygens and three water molecules. These metal binding sites are accessible from the same surface of the dimer, partly due to the disorder of the undecapeptide stretch D29 to L39. The overall structure and metal binding site of FLJ36880 bear clear similarities to the C-terminal\nactivity. Our protocol takes into account the flexibility and dynamics of the catalytic site by coupling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations aimed at modeling the protein's flexibility in solution to (i) docking with FlexX, or (ii) docking with FlexX and pharmacophoric filtering with Unity. In addition, we applied in parallel a standalone docking using the new version of Surflex software. The three approaches were used to screen the ChemBridge chemical library and the inhibitory activity of the top-ranked 333 compound obtained from each approach (1000 compound in total) was assessed in vitro using the tautomerase assay. This biochemical validation process resulted in the identification of 12 novel MIF inhibitors corresponding to a 1.2% hit rate. Six of these hits came from Surflex docking; two from FlexX docking with MD simulations and four hits were identified with MDS and pharmacophore filtering with minimal overlap between the hits from each approach. Six hits\nrole of catalysis in the biological function of MIF, we have begun to characterize the catalytic activities in more detail. Here we report the crystal structure of MIF complexed with p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, a substrate for the phenylpyruvate tautomerase activity of MIF. The three binding sites for p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate in the MIF trimer lie at the interface between two subunits. The substrate interacts with Pro-1, Lys-32, and Ile-64 from one subunit and Tyr-95 and Asn-97 from an adjacent subunit. Pro-1 is positioned to function as a catalytic base. There is no functional group that polarizes the alpha-carbonyl of the substrate to weaken the adjacent C-H bond. Mutation of Pro-1 to glycine substantially reduces the catalytic activity. The insertion of an alanine between Pro-1 and Met-2 essentially abolishes activity. Structural studies of these mutants define a source of the reduced activity and provide insight into the mechanism of the catalytic reaction. An integrative in\nactivities and whether the asymmetry has a biological purpose or role in the evolution of TSF members. Crystal structure of human D-dopachrome tautomerase, a homologue of macrophage migration inhibitory factor, at 1.54 A resolution. D-Dopachrome tautomerase shares a low homologous amino acid sequence (33% homology) with the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and possesses similar tautomerase activity as well. MIF is a cytokine involved in inflammatory reactions and immune responses. Whereas recent studies have identified MIF as a pituitary hormone and immunoregulator, much less is known about the structural basis of these physiological functions and the real significance of tautomerase activity. Therefore, interest in the structure-function relationship between D-dopachrome tautomerase and MIF has increased, especially with regard to inflammation and immune responses. We have determined the X-ray crystal structure of human D-dopachrome tautomerase at 1.54 A resolution. D-Dopachrome tautomerase folds to form a homotrimer that has extensive contact between subunits\nPrediction and characterization of protein-protein interaction network in Bacillus licheniformis WX-02. In this study, we constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of B. licheniformis strain WX-02 with interolog method and domain-based method, which contained 15,864 edges and 2,448 nodes. Although computationally predicted networks have relatively low coverage and high false-positive rate, our prediction was confirmed from three perspectives: local structural features, functional similarities and transcriptional correlations. Further analysis of the COG heat map showed that protein interactions in B. licheniformis WX-02 mainly occurred in the same functional categories. By incorporating the transcriptome data, we found that the topological properties of the PPI network were robust under normal and high salt conditions. In addition, 267 different protein complexes were identified and 117 poorly characterized proteins were annotated with certain functions based on the PPI network. Furthermore, the sub-network showed that a hub protein CcpA jointed directly or indirectly many proteins related\nMigration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) is a trimeric cytokine implicated in a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and cancer. We previously reported that the dye p425 (Chicago Sky Blue), which bound MIF at the interface of two MIF trimers covering the tautomerase and allosteric pockets, revealed a unique strategy to block MIF's pro-inflammatory activities. Structural liabilities, including the large size, precluded p425 as a medicinal chemistry lead for drug development. We report here a rational design strategy linking only the fragment of p425 that binds over the tautomerase pocket to the core of ibudilast, a known MIF allosteric site-specific inhibitor. The chimeric compound, termed L2-4048, was shown by X-ray crystallography to bind at the allosteric and tautomerase sites as anticipated. L2-4048 retained target binding and blocked MIF's tautomerase CD74 receptor binding, and pro-inflammatory activities. Our studies lay the foundation for the design and synthesis of smaller and more drug-like compounds\ncomplete loss of tautomerase activity. However, modified MIF still increased CXCL-8/IL-8 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and blocked neutrophil apoptosis, indicating that tautomerase activity is not essential for these biological functions. Pre-treatment of MIF with hypochlorous acid protected the protein from covalent modification by the MIF inhibitor 4-iodo-6-phenylpyrimidine (4-IPP). Therefore, oxidant generation at inflammatory sites may protect MIF from inactivation by more disruptive electrophiles, including drugs designed to target the tautomerase activity of MIF. Inhibition of MIF bioactivity by rational design of pharmacological inhibitors of MIF tautomerase activity. The pro-inflammatory mediator macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is produced by immune and endocrine cells and inhibits the antiinflammatory activities of glucocorticoids. MIF also catalyzes the tautomerization of the non-naturally occurring D-isomer of dopachrome, phenylpyruvate, and certain catecholamines, suggesting that MIF might exert its biological effects via enzymatic action on a substrate. However, no physiologically relevant substrate for MIF has\na critical role for the tautomerase active site in receptor binding. Thus the inhibitory effect of compound 8 on MIF bioactivities strongly correlated with the inhibition of MIF tautomerase activity, a connection not made previously through use of small-molecule MIF inhibitors. The inhibitory activity of amino acid-benzaldehyde Schiff base-type MIF antagonists is the first step toward a meaningful structure/function analysis of inhibitors of MIF cellular bioactivities. Coumarin and chromen-4-one analogues as tautomerase inhibitors of macrophage migration inhibitory factor: discovery and X-ray crystallography. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a proinflammatory cytokine released from T-cells and macrophages. Although a detailed understanding of the biological functions of MIF has not yet been clarified, it is known that MIF catalyzes the tautomerization of a nonphysiological molecule, D-dopachrome. Using a structure-based computer-assisted search of two databases of commercially available compounds, we have found 14 novel tautomerase inhibitors of MIF whose K(i) values are in\ncells and to amplify pro-inflammatory cytokine production. MIF has an unusual nucleophilic N-terminal proline with catalytic tautomerase activity. It remains unclear whether tautomerase activity is required for MIF function, but small molecules that inhibit tautomerase activity also inhibit the pro-inflammatory activities of MIF. A prominent feature of the acute inflammatory response is neutrophil activation and production of reactive oxygen species, including myeloperoxidase (MPO)-derived hypochlorous acid and hypothiocyanous acid. We hypothesized that MPO-derived oxidants would oxidize the N-terminal proline of MIF and alter its biological activity. MIF was exposed to hypochlorous acid and hypothiocyanous acid and the oxidative modifications on MIF were examined by LC-MS/MS. Imine formation and carbamylation was observed on the N-terminal proline in response to MPO-dependent generation of hypochlorous and hypothiocyanous acid, respectively. These modifications led to a complete loss of tautomerase activity. However, modified MIF still increased CXCL-8/IL-8 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and blocked\nMIF might exert its biological effects via enzymatic action on a substrate. However, no physiologically relevant substrate for MIF has been identified. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have not consistently supported a requirement for an intact, functional catalytic site as a prerequisite for MIF bioactivity. We hypothesized that the catalytically active site, but not the enzymatic activity per se, nevertheless plays a critical role in MIF pro-inflammatory activity. Accordingly, we designed small druglike molecules that bind at the catalytically active tautomerase site of MIF and tested the complex for MIF bioactivity. We describe herein the rational design and synthesis of a class of imine conjugates produced by coupling amino acids to a range of benzaldehyde derivatives that inhibit MIF tautomerase and biological activities. We found that aromatic amino acid Schiff bases were better inhibitors of MIF enzymatic and bioactivities compared to the aliphatic ones. For instance, the IC(50) inhibition of MIF tautomerase",

Our data indicate that Nedd4-2 binds to two family members, TTYH2 and TTYH3, which contain consensus PY ((L/P)PXY) binding sites for HECT type E3 ubiquitin ligases, but not to TTYH1, which lacks this motif. Consistently, Nedd4-2 ubiquitinates both TTYH2 and TTYH3. Importantly, we have shown that endogenous TTYH2 and Nedd4-2 are binding partners and demonstrated that the TTYH2 PY motif is essential for these interactions. We have also shown that Nedd4-2-mediated ubiquitination of TTYH2 is a critical regulator of cell surface and total cellular levels of this protein. These data, indicating that Nedd4-2 differentially interacts with and regulates TTYH1-3, will be important for understanding mechanisms controlling Tweety proteins in physiology and disease.

The Volume-Regulated Anion Channel (VRAC) is activated by cell swelling and plays\nper cell is in the order of 10,000, which is in agreement with earlier calculations from the comparison of single-channel and whole-cell currents. Structures of tweety homolog proteins TTYH2 and TTYH3 reveal a Ca2+-dependent switch from intra- to intermembrane dimerization. Tweety homologs (TTYHs) comprise a conserved family of transmembrane proteins found in eukaryotes with three members (TTYH1-3) in vertebrates. They are widely expressed in mammals including at high levels in the nervous system and have been implicated in cancers and other diseases including epilepsy, chronic pain, and viral infections. TTYHs have been reported to form Ca2+- and cell volume-regulated anion channels structurally distinct from any characterized protein family with potential roles in cell adhesion, migration, and developmental signaling. To provide insight into TTYH family structure and function, we determined cryo-EM structures of Mus musculus TTYH2 and TTYH3 in lipid nanodiscs. TTYH2 and TTYH3 adopt a previously unobserved fold which includes\nadditional protein partners. Biophysics and Physiology of the Volume-Regulated Anion Channel (VRAC)/Volume-Sensitive Outwardly Rectifying Anion Channel (VSOR). The volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC), also known as the volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying (VSOR) anion channel or the volume-sensitive organic osmolyte/anion channel (VSOAC), is essential for cell volume regulation after swelling in most vertebrate cell types studied to date. In addition to its role in cell volume homeostasis, VRAC has been implicated in numerous other physiological and pathophysiological processes, including cancer, ischemic brain edema, cell motility, proliferation, angiogenesis, programmed cell death, and excitotoxic glutamate release. Although VRAC has been extensively biophysically, pharmacologically, and functionally characterized, its molecular identity was highly controversial until the recent identification of the leucine-rich repeats containing 8A (LRRC8A) protein as essential for the VRAC current in multiple cell types and a likely pore-forming subunit of VRAC. Members of this distantly pannexin-1-related protein family form heteromers, and in addition to LRRC8A,\na likely pore-forming subunit of VRAC. Members of this distantly pannexin-1-related protein family form heteromers, and in addition to LRRC8A, at least another LRRC8 family member is required for the formation of a functional VRAC. This review summarizes the biophysical and pharmacological properties of VRAC, highlights its main physiological functions and pathophysiological implications, and outlines the search for its molecular identity. Regulation of Anion Channel LRRC8 Volume-Regulated Anion Channels in Transport of 2'3'-Cyclic GMP-AMP and Cisplatin under Steady State and Inflammation. The recently identified anion channel LRRC8 volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) are heteromeric hexamers constituted with the obligate LRRC8A subunit paired with at least one of the accessory LRRC8B to LRRC8E subunits. In addition to transport chloride, taurine, and glutamate, LRRC8 VRACs also transport the anticancer agent cisplatin and STING agonists 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) and cyclic dinucleotides; hence, they are implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, such\nintracellular signal transduction, a large variety of adhesion molecules and proteins potentially involved in regulating the functional and structural dynamics of the pre-synapse. Four maxi-channels, three isoforms of voltage-dependent anion channels and the tweety homolog 1 were co-isolated with the docked synaptic vesicles. As revealed by in situ hybridization, tweety homolog 1 reveals a distinct expression pattern in the rodent brain. Our results add novel information to the proteome of the presynaptic active zone and suggest that in particular proteins potentially involved in the short and long term structural modulation of the mature presynaptic compartment deserve further detailed analysis. Structural basis for assembly and lipid-mediated gating of LRRC8A:C volume-regulated anion channels. Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 8 (LRRC8) family members form volume-regulated anion channels activated by hypoosmotic cell swelling. LRRC8 channels are ubiquitously expressed in vertebrate cells as heteromeric assemblies of LRRC8A (SWELL1) and LRRC8B-E subunits. Channels of different subunit composition have\nstructures of Mus musculus TTYH2 and TTYH3 in lipid nanodiscs. TTYH2 and TTYH3 adopt a previously unobserved fold which includes an extended extracellular domain with a partially solvent exposed pocket that may be an interaction site for hydrophobic molecules. In the presence of Ca2+, TTYH2 and TTYH3 form homomeric cis-dimers bridged by extracellularly coordinated Ca2+. Strikingly, in the absence of Ca2+, TTYH2 forms trans-dimers that span opposing membranes across a ~130 \u00c5 intermembrane space as well as a monomeric state. All TTYH structures lack ion conducting pathways and we do not observe TTYH2-dependent channel activity in cells. We conclude TTYHs are not pore forming subunits of anion channels and their function may involve Ca2+-dependent changes in quaternary structure, interactions with hydrophobic molecules near the extracellular membrane surface, and/or association with additional protein partners.

The volume-regulated anion\nof the complexes depends on the LRRC8 composition. Finally, low ionic strength (\u0393) in the absence of an osmotic gradient activates the complexes in bilayers. These data demonstrate that LRRC8 proteins together constitute the VRAC pore and that hypotonic stress can activate VRAC through a decrease in cytoplasmic \u0393. Absolute Protein Amounts and Relative Abundance of Volume-regulated Anion Channel (VRAC) LRRC8 Subunits in Cells and Tissues Revealed by Quantitative Immunoblotting. The volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) plays an important role in osmotic cell volume regulation. In addition, it is involved in various physiological processes such as insulin secretion, glia-neuron communication and purinergic signaling. VRAC is formed by hetero-hexamers of members of the LRRC8 protein family, which consists of five members, LRRC8A-E. LRRC8A is an essential subunit for physiological functionality of VRAC. Its obligate heteromerization with at least one of its paralogues, LRRC8B-E, determines the biophysical properties of VRAC. Moreover, the subunit\nBiology and Physiology of Volume-Regulated Anion Channel (VRAC). The Volume-Regulated Anion Channel (VRAC) is activated by cell swelling and plays a key role in cell volume regulation. VRAC is ubiquitously expressed in vertebrate cells and also implicated in many other physiological and cellular processes including fluid secretion, glutamate release, membrane potential regulation, cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. Although its biophysical properties have been well characterized, the molecular identity of VRAC remained a mystery for almost three decades. The field was transformed by recent discoveries showing that the leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 8A (LRRC8A, also named SWELL1) and its four other homologs form heteromeric VRAC channels. The composition of LRRC8 subunits determines channel properties and substrate selectivity of a large variety of different VRACs. Incorporating purified SWELL1-containing protein complexes into lipid bilayers is sufficient to reconstitute channel activities, a finding that supports the decrease in intracellular ionic strength as the mechanism of\nbilayer, which suggests a role of TTYH proteins in the interaction with lipid-like compounds residing in the membrane. LRRC8 Proteins Form Volume-Regulated Anion Channels that Sense Ionic Strength. The volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) is activated when a cell swells, and it plays a central role in maintaining cell volume in response to osmotic challenges. SWELL1 (LRRC8A) was recently identified as an essential component of VRAC. However, the identity of the pore-forming subunits of VRAC and how the channel is gated by cell swelling are unknown. Here, we show that SWELL1 and up to four other LRRC8 subunits assemble into heterogeneous complexes of \u223c800 kDa. When reconstituted into bilayers, LRRC8 complexes are sufficient to form anion channels activated by osmolality gradients. In bilayers, as well as in cells, the single-channel conductance of the complexes depends on the LRRC8 composition. Finally, low ionic strength (\u0393) in the absence of an osmotic gradient\nnovel architecture for lipid interactions. The Tweety homologs (TTYHs) are members of a conserved family of eukaryotic membrane proteins that are abundant in the brain. The three human paralogs were assigned to function as anion channels that are either activated by Ca2+ or cell swelling. To uncover their unknown architecture and its relationship to function, we have determined the structures of human TTYH1-3 by cryo-electron microscopy. All structures display equivalent features of a dimeric membrane protein that contains five transmembrane segments and an extended extracellular domain. As none of the proteins shows attributes reminiscent of an anion channel, we revisited functional experiments and did not find any indication of ion conduction. Instead, we find density in an extended hydrophobic pocket contained in the extracellular domain that emerges from the lipid bilayer, which suggests a role of TTYH proteins in the interaction with lipid-like compounds residing in the membrane. LRRC8 Proteins\nThe ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4-2 differentially interacts with and regulates members of the Tweety family of chloride ion channels. The Tweety proteins comprise a family of chloride ion channels with three members identified in humans (TTYH1-3) and orthologues in fly and murine species. In humans, increased TTYH2 expression is associated with cancer progression, whereas fly Tweety is associated with developmental processes. Structurally, Tweety proteins are characterized by five membrane-spanning domains and N-glycan modifications important for trafficking to the plasma membrane, where these proteins are oriented with the amino terminus located extracellularly and the carboxyl terminus cytoplasmically. In addition to N-glycosylation, ubiquitination mediated by the HECT type E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 is a post-translation modification important in regulating membrane proteins. In the present study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the ability of each of TTYH1-3 to interact with Nedd4-2 and to be ubiquitinated and regulated by this ligase. Our data indicate\ncGAS on the plasma membrane, rather than its DNA-binding or enzymatic activity, enabled VRAC activation. Moreover, phospholipid PIP2 seemed to be instrumental in the membrane localization of cGAS and its association with VRACs. Corroborating a role for LRRC8A/D-containing VRACs in cisplatin transport, serum and TNF markedly potentiated cisplatin uptake and killing of cancer cells derived from human or mouse. Together, these observations provide new insights into the complex regulation of VRAC activation and suggest a novel approach to enhance the efficacy of cGAMP and cisplatin in treating infection and cancer. Structure of a volume-regulated heteromeric LRRC8A/C channel. Volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) participate in the cellular response to osmotic swelling. These membrane proteins consist of heteromeric assemblies of LRRC8 subunits, whose compositions determine permeation properties. Although structures of the obligatory LRRC8A, also referred to as SWELL1, have previously defined the architecture of VRACs, the organization of heteromeric channels has remained elusive.\nIn contrast, TTYH3-BRAF displayed increased MEK phosphorylation potential and transforming activity, which were caused by TTYH3-mediated tethering of near-full-length BRAF to the (endo)membrane system. Consistent with this mechanism, a synthetic approach, in which BRAF\u0394E1 was tethered to the membrane by fusing it to the cytoplasmic tail of CD8 also induced transformation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TTYH3-BRAF signals largely independent of a functional RAS binding domain, but requires an intact BRAF dimer interface and activation loop phosphorylation sites. Cells expressing TTYH3-BRAF exhibited increased MEK/ERK signaling, which was blocked by clinically achievable concentrations of sorafenib, trametinib, and the paradox breaker PLX8394. These data provide the first example of a fully autoinhibited BRAF protein whose oncogenic potential is dictated by a distinct fusion partner and not by a structural change in BRAF itself. The ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4-2 differentially interacts with and regulates members of the Tweety family of chloride ion channels. The Tweety\ncharacterization of a BRAF fusion oncoprotein with retained autoinhibitory domains. Fusion proteins involving the BRAF serine/threonine kinase occur in many cancers. The oncogenic potential of BRAF fusions has been attributed to the loss of critical N-terminal domains that mediate BRAF autoinhibition. We used whole-exome and RNA sequencing in a patient with glioblastoma multiforme to identify a rearrangement between TTYH3, encoding a membrane-resident, calcium-activated chloride channel, and BRAF intron 1, resulting in a TTYH3-BRAF fusion protein that retained all features essential for BRAF autoinhibition. Accordingly, the BRAF moiety of the fusion protein alone, which represents full-length BRAF without the amino acids encoded by exon 1 (BRAF\u0394E1), did not induce MEK/ERK phosphorylation or transformation. Likewise, neither the TTYH3 moiety of the fusion protein nor full-length TTYH3 provoked ERK pathway activity or transformation. In contrast, TTYH3-BRAF displayed increased MEK phosphorylation potential and transforming activity, which were caused by TTYH3-mediated tethering of near-full-length BRAF\nIts obligate heteromerization with at least one of its paralogues, LRRC8B-E, determines the biophysical properties of VRAC. Moreover, the subunit composition is of physiological relevance as it largely influences the activation mechanism and especially the substrate selectivity. However, the endogenous tissue-specific subunit composition of VRAC is unknown. We have now developed and applied a quantitative immunoblot study of the five VRAC LRRC8 subunits in various mouse cell lines and tissues, using recombinant protein for signal calibration. We found tissue-specific expression patterns of the subunits, and generally relative low expression of the essential LRRC8A subunit. Immunoprecipitation of LRRC8A also co-precipitates an excess of the other subunits, suggesting that non-LRRC8A subunits present the majority in hetero-hexamers. With this, we can estimate that in the tested cell lines, the number of VRAC channels per cell is in the order of 10,000, which is in agreement with earlier calculations from the comparison of single-channel\nagonists 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) and cyclic dinucleotides; hence, they are implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, such as cell swelling, stroke, cancer, and viral infection. Although the subunit composition largely determines VRAC substrate specificity, the opening of various VRAC pores under physiological and pathological settings remains enigmatic. In this study, we demonstrated that VRACs comprising LRRC8A and LRRC8E (LRRC8A/E-containing VRACs), specialized in cGAMP transport, can be opened by a protein component present in serum under resting condition. Serum depletion ablated the tonic activity of LRRC8A/E-containing VRACs, decreasing cGAMP transport in various human and murine cells. Also, heating or proteinase K treatment abolished the ability of serum to activate VRAC. Genetic analyses revealed a crucial role for cGAMP synthase (cGAS) in serum/TNF-promoted VRAC activation. Notably, the presence of cGAS on the plasma membrane, rather than its DNA-binding or enzymatic activity, enabled VRAC activation. Moreover, phospholipid PIP2 seemed to\nubiquitously expressed in vertebrate cells as heteromeric assemblies of LRRC8A (SWELL1) and LRRC8B-E subunits. Channels of different subunit composition have distinct properties that explain the functional diversity of LRRC8 currents across cell types. However, the basis for heteromeric LRRC8 channel assembly and function is unknown. Here we leverage a fiducial-tagging strategy to determine single-particle cryo-EM structures of heterohexameric LRRC8A:C channels in multiple conformations. Compared to homomers, LRRC8A:C channels show pronounced differences in architecture due to heterotypic LRR interactions that displace subunits away from the conduction axis and poise the channel for activation. Structures and functional studies further reveal that lipids embedded in the channel pore block ion conduction in the closed state. These results provide insight into determinants for heteromeric LRRC8 channel assembly, activity and gating by lipids. Identification and characterization of a BRAF fusion oncoprotein with retained autoinhibitory domains. Fusion proteins involving the BRAF serine/threonine kinase occur in many\nalso referred to as SWELL1, have previously defined the architecture of VRACs, the organization of heteromeric channels has remained elusive. Here we have addressed this question by the structural characterization of murine LRRC8A/C channels. Like LRRC8A, these proteins assemble as hexamers. Despite 12 possible arrangements, we find a predominant organization with an A:C ratio of two. In this assembly, four LRRC8A subunits cluster in their preferred conformation observed in homomers, as pairs of closely interacting proteins that stabilize a closed state of the channel. In contrast, the two interacting LRRC8C subunits show a larger flexibility, underlining their role in the destabilization of the tightly packed A subunits, thereby enhancing the activation properties of the protein.\nis sufficient to reconstitute channel activities, a finding that supports the decrease in intracellular ionic strength as the mechanism of VRAC activation during cell swelling. Characterization of Swell1 knockout mice uncovers the important role of VRAC in T cell development, pancreatic \u03b2-cell glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and adipocyte metabolic function. The ability to permeate organic osmolytes and metabolites is a major feature of VRAC. The list of VRAC substrates is expected to grow, now also including some cancer drugs and antibiotics even under non-cell swelling conditions. Therefore, a critical role of VRAC in drug resistance and cell-cell communication is emerging. This review summarizes the exciting recent progress on the structure-function relationship and physiology of VRAC and discusses key future questions to be solved. Cryo-EM structures of the TTYH family reveal a novel architecture for lipid interactions. The Tweety homologs (TTYHs) are members of a conserved family of eukaryotic membrane proteins that\nThe proteome of the presynaptic active zone: from docked synaptic vesicles to adhesion molecules and maxi-channels. The presynaptic proteome controls neurotransmitter release and the short and long term structural and functional dynamics of the nerve terminal. Using a monoclonal antibody against synaptic vesicle protein 2 we immunopurified a presynaptic compartment containing the active zone with synaptic vesicles docked to the presynaptic plasma membrane as well as elements of the presynaptic cytomatrix. Individual protein bands separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were subjected to nanoscale-liquid chromatography electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Combining this method with 2-dimensional benzyldimethyl-n-hexadecylammonium chloride/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight and immunodetection we identified 240 proteins comprising synaptic vesicle proteins, components of the presynaptic fusion and retrieval machinery, proteins involved in intracellular signal transduction, a large variety of adhesion molecules and proteins potentially involved in regulating the functional and structural dynamics",

RAID: a comprehensive resource for human RNA-associated (RNA-RNA/RNA-protein) interaction. Transcriptomic analyses have revealed an unexpected complexity in the eukaryote transcriptome, which includes not only protein-coding transcripts but also an expanding catalog of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Diverse coding and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) perform functions through interaction with each other in various cellular processes. In this project, we have developed RAID (http://www.rna-society.org/raid), an RNA-associated (RNA-RNA/RNA-protein) interaction database. RAID intends to provide the scientific community with all-in-one resources for efficient browsing and extraction of the RNA-associated interactions in human. This version of RAID contains more than 6100 RNA-associated interactions obtained by manually reviewing more than 2100 published papers, including 4493 RNA-RNA interactions and 1619 RNA-protein interactions. Each entry contains detailed information on an RNA-associated interaction, including RAID ID, RNA/protein symbol, RNA/protein\ninteractions and 1619 RNA-protein interactions. Each entry contains detailed information on an RNA-associated interaction, including RAID ID, RNA/protein symbol, RNA/protein categories, validated method, expressing tissue, literature references (Pubmed IDs), and detailed functional description. Users can query, browse, analyze, and manipulate RNA-associated (RNA-RNA/RNA-protein) interaction. RAID provides a comprehensive resource of human RNA-associated (RNA-RNA/RNA-protein) interaction network. Furthermore, this resource will help in uncovering the generic organizing principles of cellular function network. Functional proteomics establishes the interaction of SIRT7 with chromatin remodeling complexes and expands its role in regulation of RNA polymerase I transcription. Among mammalian sirtuins, SIRT7 is the only enzyme residing in nucleoli where ribosomal DNA is transcribed. Recent reports established that SIRT7 associates with RNA Pol I machinery and is required for rDNA transcription. Although defined by its homology to the yeast histone deacetylase Sir2, current knowledge suggests that SIRT7 itself has little to no deacetylase activity. Because only two\n13q deletions. Similar to the RNA data, a low BACH2 protein expression was associated with a significantly shorter OS than a high expression. There was no direct interaction observed between BACH2 and BCL6 in MEC-1 CLL cells, but they shared protein networks that included fifty different proteins. Interestingly, a prognostic index (PI) model that we generated, using integrative risk score values of BACH2 RNA expression, age, and 17p deletion status, predicted patient outcomes in our cohort. Taken together, these data have shown for the first time a possible prognostic role for BACH2 in CLL and have revealed protein interaction networks shared by BCL6 and BACH2, indicating a significant role for BACH2 and BCL6 in key cellular processes, including ubiquitination mediated B-cell receptor functions, nucleic acid metabolism, protein degradation, and homeostasis in CLL biology. Functional proteomics establishes the interaction of SIRT7 with chromatin remodeling complexes and expands its role in regulation\nwith factors involved in RNA Pol I- and II-dependent transcriptional processes and several nucleolus-localized chromatin remodeling complexes. Particularly enriched were members of the B-WICH complex, such as Mybbp1a, WSTF, and SNF2h. Prominent interactions were validated by a selected reaction monitoring-like approach using metabolic labeling with stable isotopes, confocal microscopy, reciprocal immunoaffinity precipitation, and co-isolation with endogenous SIRT7. To extend the current knowledge of mechanisms involved in SIRT7-dependent regulation of rDNA transcription, we showed that small interfering RNA-mediated SIRT7 knockdown leads to reduced levels of RNA Pol I protein, but not messenger RNA, which was confirmed in diverse cell types. The down-regulation of RNA Pol I protein levels placed in the context of SIRT7 interaction networks led us to propose that SIRT7 plays a crucial role in connecting the function of chromatin remodeling complexes to RNA Pol I machinery during transcription. Molecular architecture of LSM14 interactions involved in the assembly of\nlymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous disease with a highly variable clinical outcome. There are well-established CLL prognostic biomarkers that have transformed treatment and improved the understanding of CLL biology. Here, we have studied the clinical significance of two crucial B cell regulators, BACH2 (BTB and CNC homology 1, basic leucine zipper transcription factor 2) and BCL6 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 6), in a cohort of 102 CLL patients and determined the protein interaction networks that they participate in using MEC-1 CLL cells. We observed that CLL patients expressing low levels of BCL6 and BACH2 RNA had significantly shorter overall survival (OS) than high BCL6- and BACH2-expressing cases. Notably, their low expression specifically decreased the OS of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region-mutated (IGHV-M) CLL patients, as well as those with 11q and 13q deletions.

Molecular architecture of LSM14 interactions involved in the assembly of mRNA silencing complexes. The LSM domain-containing protein LSM14/Rap55 plays a role in mRNA decapping, translational repression, and RNA granule (P-body) assembly. How LSM14 interacts with the mRNA silencing machinery, including the eIF4E-binding protein 4E-T and the DEAD-box helicase DDX6, is poorly understood. Here we report the crystal structure of the LSM domain of LSM14 bound to a highly conserved C-terminal fragment of 4E-T. The 4E-T C-terminus forms a bi-partite motif that wraps around the N-terminal LSM domain of LSM14. We also determined the crystal structure of LSM14 bound to the C-terminal RecA-like domain of DDX6. LSM14 binds DDX6 via a unique non-contiguous motif with distinct directionality as compared to other DDX6-interacting proteins. Together with mutational and proteomic studies, the LSM14-DDX6 structure reveals that LSM14 has adopted a divergent mode of\nDDX6-interacting proteins. Together with mutational and proteomic studies, the LSM14-DDX6 structure reveals that LSM14 has adopted a divergent mode of binding DDX6 in order to support the formation of mRNA silencing complexes and P-body assembly. Functional characterization of the trypanosome translational repressor SCD6. The storage of translationally inactive mRNAs in cytosolic granules enables cells to react flexibly to environmental changes. In eukaryotes, Scd6 (suppressor of clathrin deficiency 6)/Rap55 (RNA-associated protein 55), a member of the LSm14 (like-Sm14) family, is an important factor in the formation and activity of P-bodies, where mRNA decay factors accumulate, in stress granules that store mRNAs under adverse conditions and in granules that store developmentally regulated mRNAs. SCD6 from Trypanosoma brucei (TbSCD6) shares the same domain architecture as orthologous proteins in other organisms and is also present in cytosolic granules (equivalent to P-bodies). We show that TbSCD6 is a general repressor of translation and that its\nEGFP-tagged SIRT7 constructs: wild type, a point mutation affecting rDNA transcription, and a deletion mutant lacking the predicted coiled-coil domain. A combinatorial proteomics and bioinformatics approach was used to integrate gene ontology classifications, functional protein networks, and normalized abundances of proteins co-isolated with SIRT7. The resulting refined proteomic data set confirmed SIRT7 interactions with RNA Pol I and upstream binding factor and highlighted association with factors involved in RNA Pol I- and II-dependent transcriptional processes and several nucleolus-localized chromatin remodeling complexes.

Because only two SIRT7 interactions have been thus far described: RNA Pol I and upstream binding factor, identification of proteins and complexes associating with SIRT7 is critical to understanding its functions. Here, we present the first characterization of SIRT7 interaction networks. We have systematically investigated protein interactions of three EGFP-tagged SIRT7 constructs: wild type, a point mutation affecting rDNA transcription, and a deletion mutant lacking the predicted coiled-coil domain. A combinatorial proteomics and bioinformatics approach was used to integrate gene ontology classifications, functional protein networks, and normalized abundances of proteins co-isolated with SIRT7. The resulting refined proteomic data set confirmed SIRT7 interactions with RNA Pol I and upstream binding factor and highlighted association with factors involved in RNA Pol I- and II-dependent transcriptional processes and several nucleolus-localized chromatin remodeling complexes. Particularly enriched were\nevolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes. Two highly conserved paralogues, RAP55A and RAP55B, exist in vertebrates; their functional properties and expression patterns remain to be compared. RAP55 proteins share multiple domains: the LSm14 domain, a serine/threonine rich region, an FDF (phenylalanine-aspartate-phenylalanine) motif, an FFD-TFG box and RGG (arginine-glycine-glycine) repeats. Together these domains are responsible for RAP55 proteins participating in translational repression, incorporation into mRNP particles, protein-protein interactions, P-body formation and stress granule localisation. All RAP55A proteins localise to P-body-like complexes either in the germline or in somatic cells. Xenopus laevis RAP55B has been shown to be part of translationally repressed mRNP complexes in early oocytes. Together these findings suggest that this protein family has evolved a common and fundamental role in the control of mRNA translation. Furthermore human RAP55A is an autoantigen detected in the serum of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). The link between RAP55A, P-bodies and PBC remains to\nprocessing bodies (P-bodies) in cultured human cells: in the latter cells, RAP55 is an essential constituent of the P-bodies. We isolated xRAP55-containing complexes from Xenopus oocytes and identified xRAP55-associated proteins, including a DEAD-box protein, Xp54, and a protein arginine methyltransferase, PRMT1. Recombinant xRAP55 repressed translation, together with Xp54, in an in vitro translation system. In addition, xRAP55 repressed translation in oocytes when tethered with a reporter mRNA. Domain analyses revealed that the N-terminal region of RAP55, including the Lsm domain, is important for the localization to P-bodies and translational repression. Taken together, our results suggest that xRAP55 is involved in translational repression of mRNA as a component of storage mRNPs.\nexpressed in oocytes is unknown. Here, a global view of oocyte-expressed RBPs is presented: mRNA-interactome capture identifies 1396 RBPs in mouse oocytes. An analysis of one of these RBPs, LSM family member 14 (LSM14B), demonstrates that this RBP is specific to oocytes and associated with many networks essential for oogenesis. Deletion of Lsm14b results in female-specific infertility and a phenotype characterized by oocytes incompetent to complete meiosis and early embryogenesis. LSM14B serves as an interaction hub for proteins and mRNAs throughout oocyte development and regulates translation of a subset of its bound mRNAs. Therefore, RNP complexes tethered by LSM14B are found exclusively in oocytes and are essential for the control of maternal mRNA fate and oocyte development. RAP55: insights into an evolutionarily conserved protein family. The RAP55 protein family is evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes. Two highly conserved paralogues, RAP55A and RAP55B, exist in vertebrates; their functional properties and expression patterns\ninduces a gene expression signature that predicts survival in breast cancer. Here we extend the analysis of RRP1B function by demonstrating that the Rrp1b activation gene expression signature accurately predicted the outcome in three of four publicly available breast carcinoma gene expression data sets. In addition, we provide insights into the mechanism of RRP1B. Tandem affinity purification demonstrated that RRP1B physically interacts with many nucleosome binding factors, including histone H1X, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, TRIM28 (tripartite motif-containing 28), and CSDA (cold shock domain protein A). Co-immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation confirmed these interactions and also interactions with heterochromatin protein-1alpha and acetyl-histone H4 lysine 5. Finally, we investigated the effects of ectopic expression of an RRP1B allelic variant previously associated with improved survival in breast cancer. Gene expression analyses demonstrate that, compared with ectopic expression of wild type RRP1B in HeLa cells, the variant RRP1B differentially modulates various transcription factors controlled by TRIM28 and\nin CLL biology. Functional proteomics establishes the interaction of SIRT7 with chromatin remodeling complexes and expands its role in regulation of RNA polymerase I transcription. Among mammalian sirtuins, SIRT7 is the only enzyme residing in nucleoli where ribosomal DNA is transcribed. Recent reports established that SIRT7 associates with RNA Pol I machinery and is required for rDNA transcription. Although defined by its homology to the yeast histone deacetylase Sir2, current knowledge suggests that SIRT7 itself has little to no deacetylase activity. Because only two SIRT7 interactions have been thus far described: RNA Pol I and upstream binding factor, identification of proteins and complexes associating with SIRT7 is critical to understanding its functions. Here, we present the first characterization of SIRT7 interaction networks. We have systematically investigated protein interactions of three EGFP-tagged SIRT7 constructs: wild type, a point mutation affecting rDNA transcription, and a deletion mutant lacking the predicted coiled-coil domain.\nin micu-1 overexpressing animals, the axonal mitochondrial calcium influx is more sustained, which likely underlies enhanced axon regrowth. Our data uncover a novel pathway that controls axon regrowth through axonal mitochondrial calcium uptake. LSM14B is an Oocyte-Specific RNA-Binding Protein Indispensable for Maternal mRNA Metabolism and Oocyte Development in Mice. Mammalian oogenesis features reliance on the mRNAs produced and stored during early growth phase. These are essential for producing an oocyte competent to undergo meiotic maturation and embryogenesis later when oocytes are transcriptionally silent. The fate of maternal mRNAs hence ensures the success of oogenesis and the quality of the resulting eggs. Nevertheless, how the fate of maternal mRNAs is determined remains largely elusive. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are crucial regulators of oogenesis, yet the identity of the full complement of RBPs expressed in oocytes is unknown. Here, a global view of oocyte-expressed RBPs is presented: mRNA-interactome capture identifies 1396 RBPs in\npresent in cytosolic granules (equivalent to P-bodies). We show that TbSCD6 is a general repressor of translation and that its depletion by RNAi results in a global increase in protein synthesis. With few exceptions, the steady-state levels of proteins are unchanged. TbSCD6 is not required for the formation of starvation-induced granules in trypanosomes, and unlike Scd6 from yeast, Plasmodium and all multicellular organisms analysed to date, it does not form a complex with the helicase Dhh1 (DExD/H-box helicase 1). In common with Xenopus laevis RAP55, TbSCD6 co-purifies with two arginine methyltransferases; moreover, TbSCD6 itself is methylated on three arginine residues. Finally, a detailed analysis identified roles for the Lsm and N-rich domains in both protein localization and translational repression. Low BACH2 Expression Predicts Adverse Outcome in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous disease with a highly variable clinical outcome. There are well-established CLL prognostic biomarkers that\nThe TUTase URT1 connects decapping activators and prevents the accumulation of excessively deadenylated mRNAs to avoid siRNA biogenesis. Uridylation is a widespread modification destabilizing eukaryotic mRNAs. Yet, molecular mechanisms underlying TUTase-mediated mRNA degradation remain mostly unresolved. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis TUTase URT1 participates in a molecular network connecting several translational repressors/decapping activators. URT1 directly interacts with DECAPPING 5 (DCP5), the Arabidopsis ortholog of human LSM14 and yeast Scd6, and this interaction connects URT1 to additional decay factors like DDX6/Dhh1-like RNA helicases. Nanopore direct RNA sequencing reveals a global role of URT1 in shaping poly(A) tail length, notably by preventing the accumulation of excessively deadenylated mRNAs. Based on in vitro and in planta data, we propose a model that explains how URT1 could reduce the accumulation of oligo(A)-tailed mRNAs both by favoring their degradation and because 3' terminal uridines intrinsically hinder deadenylation. Importantly, preventing the accumulation of excessively deadenylated\nsuggesting that mRNA decay components form at least two types of cytoplasmic granules. Following axon injury in adult neurons, loss of CAR-1 or CGH-1 results in increased axon regrowth and growth cone formation, whereas loss of DCAP-1 or DCAP-2 results in reduced regrowth. To determine how CAR-1 inhibits regrowth, we analyzed mRNAs bound to pan-neuronally expressed GFP::CAR-1 using a crosslinking and immunoprecipitation-based approach. Among the putative mRNA targets of CAR-1, we characterized the roles of micu-1, a regulator of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter MCU-1, in axon injury. We show that loss of car-1 results increased MICU-1 protein levels, and that enhanced axon regrowth in car-1 mutants is dependent on micu-1 and mcu-1. Moreover, axon injury induces transient calcium influx into axonal mitochondria, dependent on MCU-1. In car-1 loss-of-function mutants and in micu-1 overexpressing animals, the axonal mitochondrial calcium influx is more sustained, which likely underlies enhanced axon regrowth. Our data\nboth by favoring their degradation and because 3' terminal uridines intrinsically hinder deadenylation. Importantly, preventing the accumulation of excessively deadenylated mRNAs avoids the biogenesis of illegitimate siRNAs that silence endogenous mRNAs and perturb Arabidopsis growth and development. The mRNA Decay Factor CAR-1/LSM14 Regulates Axon Regeneration via Mitochondrial Calcium Dynamics. mRNA decay factors regulate mRNA turnover by recruiting non-translating mRNAs and targeting them for translational repression and mRNA degradation. How mRNA decay pathways regulate cellular function in vivo with specificity is poorly understood. Here, we show that C. elegans mRNA decay factors, including the translational repressors CAR-1/LSM14 and CGH-1/DDX6, and the decapping enzymes DCAP-1/DCP1, function in neurons to differentially regulate axon development, maintenance, and regrowth following injury. In neuronal cell bodies, CAR-1 fully colocalizes with CGH-1 and partially colocalizes with DCAP-1, suggesting that mRNA decay components form at least two types of cytoplasmic granules.

        "desc": "The dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase-like protein 6 (DPP6) is a specific beta-subunit of neuronal K(V)4 channels, which may promote gating through interactions between the single transmembrane segment of DPP6 and the channel's voltage sensing domain (VSD). A combination of gating current measurements and protein biochemistry (in-vitro translation and co-immunoprecipitations) revealed preferential physical interaction between the isolated K(V)4.2-VSD and DPP6. Significantly weaker interactions were detected between DPP6 and K(V)1.3 channels or the K(V)4.2 pore domain. More efficient gating charge movement resulting from a direct interaction between DPP6 and the K(V)4.2-VSD is unique among the known actions of K(V) channel beta-subunits. This study shows that the modular VSD of a K(V) channel can be directly regulated by transmembrane protein-protein interactions involving an extrinsic beta-subunit. Understanding these interactions may shed light on the pathophysiology of recently identified human disorders associated with mutations affecting the dpp6 gene. A single transmembrane site in the KCNE-encoded proteins controls the\nauxiliary subunits. These CLC regulatory subunits are small proteins that present few common characteristics among them, both structurally and functionally, and their effects on the corresponding CLC protein are different. Barttin, a protein with two transmembrane domains, is essential for the membrane localization of ClC-K proteins and their activity in the kidney and inner ear. Ostm1 is a protein with a single transmembrane domain and a highly glycosylated N-terminus. Unlike the other two CLC auxiliary subunits, Ostm1 shows a reciprocal relationship with ClC-7 for their stability. The subcellular localization of Ostm1 depends on ClC-7 and not the other way around. ClC-2 is active on its own, but GlialCAM, a transmembrane cell adhesion molecule with two extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, regulates its subcellular localization and activity in glial cells. The common theme for these three proteins is their requirement for a proper homeostasis, since their malfunction leads to distinct diseases. We\n20 years ago opened the door to investigations, and controversies, into PC1's potential function as a novel G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Subsequent biochemical and cellular-based assays supported an ability of the PC1 C-tail to bind numerous members of the G\u03b1 protein family and to either inhibit or activate G protein-dependent pathways involved in the regulation of ion channel activity, transcription factor activation, and apoptosis. More recent work has demonstrated an essential role for PC1-mediated G protein regulation in preventing kidney cyst development; however, the mechanisms by which PC1 regulates G protein activity continue to be discovered. Similarities between PC1 and the adhesion class of 7-TM GPCRs, most notably a conserved GPCR proteolysis site (GPS) before the first TM domain, which undergoes autocatalyzed proteolytic cleavage, suggest potential mechanisms for PC1-mediated regulation of G protein signaling. This article reviews the evidence supporting GPCR-like functions of PC1 and their relevance to cystic disease,\nof G protein signaling. This article reviews the evidence supporting GPCR-like functions of PC1 and their relevance to cystic disease, discusses the involvement of GPS cleavage and potential ligands in regulating PC1 GPCR function, and explores potential connections between PC1 GPCR-like activity and regulation of the channel properties of the polycystin receptor-channel complex.\nand Ba2+ permeate TRPV6 pore according to the knock-off mechanism, while tight binding of Gd3+ to the aspartate ring blocks the channel and prevents Na+ from permeating the pore. The iris-like channel opening is accompanied by an \u03b1-to-\u03c0 helical transition in the pore-lining transmembrane helix S6. As a result of this transition, the intracellular halves of the S6 helices bend and rotate by about 100 deg, exposing different residues to the channel pore in the open and closed states. Channel opening is also associated with changes in occupancy of the transmembrane domain lipid binding sites. The inhibitor 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) binds to TRPV6 in a pocket formed by the cytoplasmic half of the S1-S4 transmembrane helical bundle and shifts open-closed channel equilibrium towards the closed state by outcompeting lipids critical for activation. Ca2+ inhibits TRPV6 via binding to calmodulin (CaM), which mediates Ca2+ -dependent inactivation. The TRPV6-CaM complex exhibits 1:1\nreduced sensitivity to endogenous negative inhibitors (Mg2+, proton, and zinc), prolonged synaptic-like response time course, increased single-channel mean open time, and increased channel open probability. These results suggest that the gain-of-function M817V mutation causes overactivation of NMDAR and drives neuronal hyperexcitability, which may contribute to the patient's observed epileptic phenotype. Molecular modeling of the closed channel conformation reveals that this mutation weakens the interaction between GluN2 transmembrane helix M4 and two GluN1 transmembrane helices, and increases atomic fluctuation or movement of the pre-M1 region of GluN1 subunit, suggesting a mechanism by which channel function is enhanced. The functional changes of this mutation on agonist potency occur when the mutation is introduced into all other GluN2 subunits, suggesting a conserved role of this residue in control of NMDAR function through interactions of membrane spanning GluN2 and GluN1 helices. A number of NMDAR-targeted drugs including U.S. Food and Drug Association-approved NMDAR channel\n(7067.3\u00b1878 and 9201\u00b11345 ms, respectively). Similarly, the percentage desensitisation after 20 seconds was significantly less (p<0.05) for \u03b17V201-5HT3A and \u03b174TM-5HT3A (70.8\u00b13.2 and 64.6\u00b12.9 %, respectively) than for 5-HT3A3-4Loop-\u03b17 and 5-HT3A (90.7\u00b10.9 and 84.1\u00b17.1 %, respectively). Considerable differences were also apparent in the noise variance of functional responses obtained with these subunit constructs, suggesting that regions outside of the four proposed transmembrane domains exert an influence upon ion channel properties (Figure 5 and Table 1). Previous studies have reported that homomeric 5-HT3A receptors, produced by the heterologous expression of 5-HT3A, exhibit very small (sub-pS) single-channel openings. Consistent with this is our observation that tsA201 cells expressing 5-HT3A generated whole-cell responses with little detectable noise during agonist application (Figure 5). Noise analysis of responses obtained with 5-HT3A gave a single-channel conductance of 0.7\u00b10.1 pS, (n=8; Figure 5). The 5-HT3A3-4Loop-\u03b17 chimaera, in which the M3-M4 cytoplasmic loop of 5-HT3A is replaced with that\nand by the similarity in conductance between 5HT3A & \u03b17V201-5HT3A. It would appear, therefore, that multiple subunit domains, perhaps by allosteric conformational changes, are able to influence the rate of ion permeation through the channel. In conclusion, the main findings of the present study concern the identification of nAChR and 5HT3R subunit domains which influence ion channel properties and efficiency of heterologous expression. We conclude that the widely reported problems associated with inefficient functional expression of \u03b17 nAChR in the absence of the associated protein RIC-3 are due to the \u03b17 transmembrane domains. In addition to the well-establish evidence that single channel conductance is influenced by the pore-forming M2 domain, our data supports recent evidence that ion channel conductance can be influenced by intracellular domains. Our data extend these findings by demonstrating that extracellular subunit domains are also able to influence single channel conductance.

Key results Subunit domains which influence properties such as rectification, desensitisation and conductance have been identified. In addition, the influence of subunit domains upon subunit folding, receptor assembly and cell-surface expression has been identified. Co-expression studies with the nAChR-associated protein RIC-3 revealed that, in contrast to the potentiating effect of RIC-3 on \u03b17 nAChRs, RIC-3 caused reduced levels of cell-surface expression of some \u03b17/5-HT3A chimaeras. Conclusions and Implications Evidence has been obtained which demonstrates that subunit transmembrane domains are critical for efficient subunit folding and assembly. In addition, functional characterisation of subunit chimaeras revealed that both extracellular and cytoplasmic domains exert a dramatic and significant influence upon single-channel conductance. These data support a role for regions other than hydrophobic transmembrane domains in determining ion channel properties. Introduction Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are pentameric ligand-gated\n(and therefore ventricular I(Kr)) in vivo. Some ancillary subunits may exhibit varied expression to shape spatial Kv current variation, for example, KChIP2 and the epicardial-endocardial I(to) current density gradient. Indeed, it is likely that most native ventricular Kv channels exhibit temporal and spatial heterogeneity of subunit composition, complicating both modeling of their functional impact on the ventricular action potential and design of specific current-targeted compounds. Here, we discuss current thinking and lines of experimentation aimed at resolving the complexities of the Kv channel complexes that repolarize the human ventricular myocardium. The dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase-like protein 6 is an integral voltage sensor-interacting beta-subunit of neuronal K(V)4.2 channels. Auxiliary beta-subunits dictate the physiological properties of voltage-gated K(+) (K(V)) channels in excitable tissues. In many instances, however, the underlying mechanisms of action are poorly understood. The dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase-like protein 6 (DPP6) is a specific beta-subunit of neuronal K(V)4 channels, which may promote gating through interactions between\nbinding (3.5\u00b10.7 pmol mg-1 protein, n=6; Figure 1), similar to that observed with \u03b17V201-5HT3A. These findings demonstrate that efficient subunit folding and assembly (as assayed by [125I]\u03b1BTX binding) is possible in tsA201 cells only for those subunits examined which contain all four transmembrane domains from 5-HT3A (\u03b17V201-5HT3A and \u03b174TM-5HT3A). To examine whether this was a valid conclusion, three additional chimaeras (\u03b171&4TM-5HT3A, \u03b171,2&4TM-5HT3A and \u03b171TM&D265-5HT3A) were constructed which contained combinations of TM domains derived from \u03b17 and 5-HT3A (Figure 1). In all cases, no significant binding of [125I]\u03b1BTX was detected. Radioligand binding studies were also performed with intact transfected cells to examine whether specific [125I]\u03b1BTX binding could be detected on the cell surface. High levels of cell-surface [125I]\u03b1BTX binding were detected in cells transfected with either \u03b17V201-5HT3A or \u03b174TM-5HT3A (3.5\u00b10.5 and 2.7\u00b10.5 pmol mg-1 protein, respectively; n=6). No significant surface binding of [125I]\u03b1BTX could be detected with \u03b17 or with the\nof membrane spanning GluN2 and GluN1 helices. A number of NMDAR-targeted drugs including U.S. Food and Drug Association-approved NMDAR channel blockers were evaluated for their ability to inhibit receptors containing GluN2A(M817V) as a first step to exploring the potential for rescue pharmacology and personalized medicine. The GPCR properties of polycystin-1- A new paradigm. Polycystin-1 (PC1) is an 11-transmembrane (TM) domain-containing protein encoded by the PKD1 gene, the most frequently mutated gene leading to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). This large (> 462 kDal) protein has a complex posttranslational maturation process, with over five proteolytic cleavages having been described, and is found at multiple cellular locations. The initial description of the binding and activation of heterotrimeric G\u03b1i/o by the juxtamembrane region of the PC1 cytosolic C-terminal tail (C-tail) more than 20 years ago opened the door to investigations, and controversies, into PC1's potential function as a novel G protein-coupled receptor\n2.7\u00b10.5 pmol mg-1 protein, respectively; n=6). No significant surface binding of [125I]\u03b1BTX could be detected with \u03b17 or with the other subunit chimaeras containing an \u03b17 extracellular domain. To examine further the influence of the large intracellular loop, two additional chimaeras (\u03b173-4Loop-5HT3A and 5-HT3A3-4Loop-\u03b17) were constructed (Figure. 1). No [125I]\u03b1BTX binding was detected in cells transfected with \u03b173-4Loop-5HT3A (Figure. 1), but high levels of specific binding of the 5-HT3A receptor ligand [3H]GR65630 were detected in cells transfected with 5-HT3A3-4Loop-\u03b17 (0.38\u00b10.07 pmol mg-1 protein, n=9; Figure 1). Recent evidence has indicated that difficulties in the efficient expression of \u03b17 in cultured mammalian cell lines (including tsA201 cells) can be overcome by co-expression of the nAChR-associated protein RIC-3. The present study suggests that in the absence of RIC-3, the transmembrane regions of \u03b17 are responsible for inefficient folding and cell-surface expression. As we have reported previously, when \u03b17 is co-expressed with RIC-3\nno specific binding of [125I]\u03b1BTX was detected in cells transfected with \u03b17/5-HT3A chimaeras containing an N-terminal \u03b17 subunit domain which was fused to the C-terminal domain 5-HT3A after transmembrane region M3 (\u03b17G301-5HT3A), M2 (\u03b17D265-5HT3A) or M1 (\u03b17S235-5HT3A). Additional \u03b17/5-HT3A subunit chimaeras were constructed which contained the entire \u03b17 sequence, except for selected transmembrane domains derived from the analogous regions of 5-HT3A (\u03b171TM-5HT3A, \u03b172TM-5HT3A, \u03b173TM-5HT3A, \u03b174TM-5HT3A, Figure 1). Chimaeras containing the M1 region of 5-HT3A (\u03b171TM-5HT3A), M1-M2 region of 5-HT3A (\u03b172TM-5HT3A) or the M1-M3 region (\u03b173TM-5HT3A) showed little or no specific [125I]\u03b1BTX binding (Figure 1). In contrast, expression of a chimaera (\u03b174TM-5HT3A) which contained all four of the predicted transmembrane domains from 5-HT3A, but containing the N-terminal and the large intracellular loop of \u03b17, resulted in high levels of specific [125I]\u03b1BTX binding (3.5\u00b10.7 pmol mg-1 protein, n=6; Figure 1), similar to that observed with \u03b17V201-5HT3A. These findings demonstrate that efficient subunit\nidentified human disorders associated with mutations affecting the dpp6 gene. A single transmembrane site in the KCNE-encoded proteins controls the specificity of KvLQT1 channel gating. KCNEs are a family of genes encoding small integral membrane proteins whose role in governing voltage-gated potassium channel gating is emerging. Whether each member of this homologous family interacts with channel proteins in the same manner is unknown; however, it is clear that the functional effect of each KCNE on channel gating is different. The specificity of KCNE1 (minK) and KCNE3 control of activation of the potassium channel KvLQT1 maps to a triplet of amino acids within the KCNE transmembrane domain by chimera analysis. We now define the structural determinants of functional specificity within this triplet. The central amino acid of the triplet (Thr-58 of minK and Val-72 of KCNE3) is essential for the specific control of voltage-dependent channel activation characteristics of both minK and\nancillary subunits include the MinK-related proteins (MiRPs) encoded by KCNE genes, which modulate members of most Kv alpha subunit subfamilies, and the putative 12-transmembrane domain KCR1 protein, which modulates hERG. In some cases, such as the ventricular I(Ks) channel complex, it is well established that the KCNQ1 alpha subunit must coassemble with the MinK (KCNE1) single-transmembrane domain ancillary subunit for recapitulation of the characteristic, unusually slowly-activating I(Ks) current. In other cases, it is not so clear-cut, and in particular, the roles of the other MiRPs (1-4) in regulating cardiac Kv channels such as KCNQ1 and hERG in vivo are under debate. MiRP1 alters hERG function and pharmacology, and inherited MiRP1 mutations are associated with inherited and acquired arrhythmias, but controversy exists over the native role of MiRP1 in regulating hERG (and therefore ventricular I(Kr)) in vivo. Some ancillary subunits may exhibit varied expression to shape spatial Kv current variation, for\n\u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors The C. elegans ric-3 gene is required for maturation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors Ca2++ permeability of cloned and native 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptors The ion channel of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is formed by the homologous helices MII of the receptor subunits Functional properties of a cloned 5-hydroxytryptamine ionotropic receptor subunit: comparison with native mouse receptors Rings of negatively charged amino acids determine the acetylcholine receptor channel conductance Location of a \u03b4-subunit region determining ion transport through the acetylcholine receptor channel The chaperone protein 14-3-3\u03b7 interacts with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor \u03b14 subunit Functional nicotinic ACh receptors on interneurones in the rat hippocampus Differences in the fate of neuronal acetylcholine receptor protein expressed in neurons and stably transfected cells A cytoplasmic region determines single-channel conductance in 5-HT3 receptors RIC-3 enhances functional expression of multiple nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes in mammalian cells Molecular characterisation of D\u03b16 and\nminK and Val-72 of KCNE3) is essential for the specific control of voltage-dependent channel activation characteristics of both minK and KCNE3. Using site-directed mutations that substitute minK and KCNE3 residues, we determined that a hydroxylated central amino acid is necessary for the slow sigmoidal activation produced by minK. The precise spacing of the hydroxyl group was required for minK-like activation. An aliphatic amino acid substituted at position 58 of minK is capable of reproducing KCNE3-like kinetics and voltage-independent constitutive current activation. The bulk of the central residue is another critical parameter, indicating precise positioning of this portion of the KCNE proteins within the channel complex. An intermediate phenotype produced by several smaller aliphatic-substituted mutants yields conditional voltage independence that is distinct from the voltage-dependent gating process, suggesting that KCNE3 traps the channel in a stable open state. From these results, we propose a model of KCNE-potassium channel interaction where the\nthe primary force in ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium channels comprise tetramers of pore-forming alpha subunits and, in probably most cases in vivo, ancillary or beta subunits that help define the properties of the Kv current generated. Ancillary subunits can be broadly categorized as cytoplasmic or transmembrane and can modify Kv channel trafficking, conductance, gating, ion selectivity, regulation, and pharmacology. Because of their often profound effects on Kv channel function, studies of the molecular correlates of ventricular repolarization must take into account ancillary subunits as well as alpha subunits. Cytoplasmic ancillary subunits include the Kv beta subunits, which regulate a range of Kv channels and may link channel gating to redox potential, and the KChIPs, which appear most often associated with Kv4 subfamily channels that generate the ventricular I(to) current. Transmembrane ancillary subunits include the MinK-related proteins (MiRPs) encoded by KCNE genes, which modulate members of most Kv alpha subunit subfamilies,",

On the basis of these results, the molecular mechanism of osmoregulation of ompF and ompC is discussed. Molecular basis for promoter selectivity of the transcriptional activator OmpR of Escherichia coli: isolation of mutants that can activate the non-cognate kdpABC promoter. Escherichia coli has two osmo-responsive two-component regulatory systems, the EnvZ-OmpR and KdpD-KdpE systems, each of which consists of a sensor histidine protein kinase and a response regulator. The OmpR and KdpE response regulators belong to the same family of DNA-binding proteins, and act as positive transcriptional factors in response to the medium osmolarity. However, OmpR specifically activates the ompC gene encoding the OmpC outer membrane protein, whereas KdpE exclusively activates the kdpABC operon encoding the high-affinity Kdp potassium-transporter. To gain insight into the\nexpression of the outer membrane porin proteins, OmpF and OmpC. In this system, OmpR functions as a transcriptional regulator, serving as an activator of ompC, and as both an activator and a repressor of ompF. Previous evidence suggests that OmpR-mediated transcriptional activation involves direct interaction between OmpR and the C-terminal domain of the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase. However, it has remained unclear what region(s) of OmpR is directly involved in this proposed interaction. Moreover, little else is known about how OmpR activates transcription. To identify residues important for transcriptional activation, we screened for mutations in ompR that render the protein specifically defective in its ability to activate transcription. The isolated ompR alleles were characterized through haploid and diploid analyses at both the ompF and ompC promoters, and through an in vivo DNA binding assay. Through this approach, we have identified five amino acid residues in OmpR that are specifically\nin vivo DNA binding assay. Through this approach, we have identified five amino acid residues in OmpR that are specifically required for transcriptional activation; R42, P179, E193, A196 and E198. We propose that these mutations define a region(s) in OmpR that may contact the C-terminal domain of alpha to mediate transcriptional activation. Formation of the stoichiometric complex of EnvZ, a histidine kinase, with its response regulator, OmpR. EnvZ, a histidine kinase, and its cognate response regulator OmpR of Escherichia coli are responsible for adaptation to external osmotic changes by regulating the levels of the outer membrane porin proteins, OmpF and OmpC. The osmosensor, EnvZ, has dual enzymatic functions with OmpR kinase and OmpR-P phosphatase. Here, we demonstrate that the cytoplasmic kinase domain of EnvZ (EnvZc) and OmpR are able to form a 1:1 complex detected by native PAGE. This indicates that two OmpR molecules can bind to one EnvZc dimer.\nOmpR mutant was revealed to have a single amino acid replacement of Gly227 to Cys. The newly-introduced-Cys residue allows OmpR molecules to form a stable dimer in vitro without the help of the N-terminal half. This altered C-terminal half is able to bind efficiently and specifically to the cognate DNA in vitro. It can function as an activator for ompC transcription in vitro in a phosphorylation-independent manner. These results suggest that the putative activator domain of OmpR, together with the DNA-binding domain, is most likely located in the C-terminal half. They also suggested that the phosphorylation of OmpR may not be essential for gene activation per se. OmpR mutants specifically defective for transcriptional activation. In Escherichia coli, OmpR and EnvZ comprise a two component regulatory system that controls the relative expression of the outer membrane porin proteins, OmpF and OmpC. In this system, OmpR functions as a transcriptional regulator, serving\nother members of the OmpR/PhoB family of RRs in contrast to previously proposed models of OmpR activation. Signal transduction and osmoregulation in Escherichia coli. A novel type of mutation in the phosphorylation domain of the activator protein, OmpR, results in a defect in its phosphorylation-dependent DNA binding. The transcriptional factors, OmpR and EnvZ, are crucially involved in the osmotic regulation of ompF and ompC expression in Escherichia coli. The DNA binding ability of the positive regulator, OmpR, is modulated through its phosphorylation and dephosphorylation mediated by EnvZ in response to the medium osmolarity. In this study, two examples of a novel type of mutant ompR allele, ompR96A and ompR115S, whose phenotype is OmpF- OmpC- irrespective of the medium osmolarity, were characterized. These mutations result in amino acid conversions, Glu96 to Ala and Arg115 to Ser, respectively, within the phosphorylation domain of OmpR. Nevertheless, these mutant proteins were capable of undergoing\nAmino acids important for DNA recognition by the response regulator OmpR. Response regulators undergo regulated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at conserved aspartic acid residues in bacterial signal transduction systems. OmpR is a winged helix-turnhelix DNA-binding protein that functions as a global regulator in bacteria and is also important in pathogenesis. A detailed mechanistic picture of how OmpR binds to DNA and activates transcription is lacking. We used NMR spectroscopy to solve the solution structure of the C-terminal domain of OmpR (OmpR(C)) and to analyze the chemical shift changes that occur upon DNA binding. There is little overlap in the interaction surface with residues of PhoB that were reportedly involved in protein/protein interactions in its head-to-tail dimer. Multiple factors account for the lack of overlap. One is that the spacing between the OmpR half-sites is shorter than observed with PhoB, requiring the arrangement of the two OmpR molecules to be different from\nnor the proteins involved are known. We have found that relaxation of DNA supercoiling induces expression of the Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI)-2 regulator ssrA as well as the SPI-1 regulator hilC through a mechanism that requires the two-component regulator OmpR-EnvZ. Additionally, the ompR promoter is autoregulated in the same fashion. Conversely, the SPI-1 regulator hilD is induced by DNA relaxation but is repressed by OmpR. Relaxation of DNA supercoiling caused an increase in OmpR binding to DNA and a concomitant decrease in binding by the nucleoid-associated protein FIS. The reciprocal occupancy of DNA by OmpR and FIS was not due to antagonism between these transcription factors, but was instead a more intrinsic response to altered DNA topology. Surprisingly, DNA relaxation had no detectable effect on the binding of the global repressor H-NS. These results reveal the underlying molecular mechanism that primes SPI genes for rapid induction at the onset of\nand then forms a symmetric or asymmetric dimer, depending on the binding site. We propose that during activation OmpR binds to DNA and undergoes a conformational change that promotes phosphorylation of the N-terminal receiver domain, the receiver domains dimerize, and then the second monomer binds to DNA. The flexible linker of OmpR enables the second monomer to bind in multiple orientations (head-to-tail and head-to-head), depending on the specific DNA contacts. Phosphorylation stimulates the cooperative DNA-binding properties of the transcription factor OmpR. The two-component regulatory proteins OmpR and EnvZ of Escherichia coli K-12 regulate expression of the major outer membrane porin protein, OmpF. OmpR is a DNA-binding protein that is involved in both the positive and negative control of ompF transcription. EnvZ is a histidine kinase that phosphorylates OmpR in response to environmental signals. We used DNA migration retardation analysis to examine the interactions of OmpR and the phosphorylated form of\nvast array of genes to activate or repress transcription. Direct interaction between the transcription factors CadC and OmpR involved in the acid stress response of Salmonella enterica. In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, the acid-sensing regulator CadC activates transcription of the cadBA operon which contributes to the acid tolerance response. The DNA-binding response regulator OmpR in two-component regulatory system with EnvZ binds to its own promoter for autoinduction. We previously reported that CadC exerts a negative influence on ompR transcription during acid adaptation. However, its underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here we show that the level of OmpR protein is gradually reduced by a gradual increase in the CadC level using an arabinose-inducible expression system, indicating there exists a negative correlation between the expression levels of two transcription factors. To explore the molecular basis for OmpR repression by CadC, we performed in vitro binding assays and determined that CadC directly\nto environmental signals. We used DNA migration retardation analysis to examine the interactions of OmpR and the phosphorylated form of OmpR (OmpR-P) with the regulatory region immediately upstream of the ompF promoter. Our results indicate that the binding of OmpR to this regulatory region is cooperative and that phosphorylation significantly stimulates these cooperative interactions. Moreover, although phosphorylation increases the intrinsic binding of OmpR to a single OmpR-binding site, the primary role of phosphorylation in ompF regulation is to facilitate cooperative interactions between OmpR molecules bound at adjacent sites. Based on these results, we propose a model to explain how the phosphorylation of OmpR could stimulate the occupancy of specific sites in the ompF regulatory region, thereby resulting in the activation or repression of ompF transcription under the appropriate environmental conditions. Gene activation by the Escherichia coli positive regulator, OmpR. Phosphorylation-independent mechanism of activation by an OmpR mutant. In Escherichia coli,\nthe isolated OmpR mutants have an altered property with regard to the interaction with RNA polymerase on the kdpABC promoter. We propose that the promoter selectivity of OmpR is determined not only by its DNA-binding specificity, but also by the spatial configuration of the promoter on which OmpR must properly associate with RNA polymerase. A fundamental regulatory mechanism operating through OmpR and DNA topology controls expression of Salmonella pathogenicity islands SPI-1 and SPI-2. DNA topology has fundamental control over the ability of transcription factors to access their target DNA sites at gene promoters. However, the influence of DNA topology on protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions is poorly understood. For example, relaxation of DNA supercoiling strongly induces the well-studied pathogenicity gene ssrA (also called spiR) in Salmonella enterica, but neither the mechanism nor the proteins involved are known. We have found that relaxation of DNA supercoiling induces expression of the Salmonella pathogenicity\nompF and ompC in response to changes in osmolarity. It has recently become apparent that OmpR functions as a global regulator, by regulating the expression of many genes in addition to the porin genes. OmpR consists of two domains; phosphorylation of the N-terminal receiver domain increases DNA binding affinity of the C-terminal domain and vice versa. Many response regulators including PhoB and FixJ dimerize upon phosphorylation. Here, we demonstrate that OmpR dimerization is stimulated by phosphorylation or by DNA binding. The dimerization interface revealed here was unanticipated and had previously not been predicted. Using the accepted head-to-tail tandem-binding model as a guide, we set out to examine the intermolecular interactions between OmpR dimers bound to DNA by protein-protein cross-linking methods. Surprisingly, amino acid positions that we expected to form cross-linked dimers did not. Conversely, positions predicted not to form dimers did. Because of these results, we designed a series of\nGene activation by the Escherichia coli positive regulator, OmpR. Phosphorylation-independent mechanism of activation by an OmpR mutant. In Escherichia coli, expression of the major outer membrane proteins, OmpC and OmpF, is regulated through the functions of OmpR and EnvZ at the transcriptional level in response to the medium osmolarity. OmpR is the crucial activator that helps RNA polymerase to efficiently trigger ompC and ompF transcription. This OmpR function is modulated by phosphorylation mediated by the cognate sensory kinase, EnvZ. Phosphorylation at the N-terminal domain of OmpR results in substantial enhancement of the DNA-binding ability of the C-terminal domain, thereby allowing the activation of ompC and ompF transcription by OmpR. Here we isolated an OmpR mutant which lacks the N-terminal half, but can enhance transcription in vivo. This novel type of OmpR mutant was revealed to have a single amino acid replacement of Gly227 to Cys. The newly-introduced-Cys residue allows OmpR\nvitro. Phosphorylation alters the interaction of the response regulator OmpR with its sensor kinase EnvZ. OmpR and EnvZ comprise a two-component system that regulates the porin genes ompF and ompC in response to changes in osmolarity. EnvZ is autophosphorylated by intracellular ATP on a histidine residue, and it transfers the phosphoryl group to an aspartic acid residue of OmpR. EnvZ can also dephosphorylate phospho-OmpR (OmpR-P) to control the cellular level of OmpR-P. At low osmolarity, OmpR-P levels are low because of either low EnvZ kinase or high EnvZ phosphatase activities. At high osmolarity, OmpR-P is elevated. It has been proposed that EnvZ phosphatase is the activity that is regulated by osmolarity. OmpR is a two-domain response regulator; phosphorylation of OmpR increases its affinity for DNA, and DNA binding stimulates phosphorylation. The step that is affected by DNA depends upon the phosphodonor employed. In the present work, we have used fluorescence\nRR, enabling homodimerization and subsequently enhanced DNA binding. Incongruently, it has been suggested that OmpR, the eponymous member of this RR family, becomes activated via different mechanisms, whereby DNA binding plays a central role in facilitating dimerization and phosphorylation. Characterization of the rate and extent of the phosphorylation of OmpR and OmpR DNA-binding mutants following activation of the EnvZ/OmpR two-component system shows that DNA binding is not essential for phosphorylation of OmpR in vivo. In addition, detailed analyses of the energetics of DNA binding and dimerization of OmpR in both its unphosphorylated and phosphorylated state indicate that phosphorylation enhances OmpR dimerization and that this dimerization enhancement is the energetic driving force for phosphorylation-mediated regulation of OmpR-DNA binding. These findings suggest that OmpR phosphorylation-mediated activation follows the same paradigm as the other members of the OmpR/PhoB family of RRs in contrast to previously proposed models of OmpR activation. Signal transduction and\nAla and Arg115 to Ser, respectively, within the phosphorylation domain of OmpR. Nevertheless, these mutant proteins were capable of undergoing phosphorylation and dephosphorylation normally, just like wild-type OmpR. However, the phosphorylation-dependent enhancement of their in vitro DNA binding ability was found to be severely affected. It was thus revealed that these mutant OmpR represent a novel type in terms of the mechanism of phosphorylation-dependent activation of the function of OmpR, i.e. those are normally phosphorylated but not activated to bind to the cognate promoter DNAs. In this respect, it was further suggested that OmpR oligomerization may be involved in the mechanism underlying the phosphorylation-dependent enhancement of the DNA binding ability of OmpR. The mutant proteins characterized in this study seem to be defective in this particular oligomerization process observed in vitro. Phosphorylation alters the interaction of the response regulator OmpR with its sensor kinase EnvZ. OmpR and EnvZ comprise a\nouter membrane protein, whereas KdpE exclusively activates the kdpABC operon encoding the high-affinity Kdp potassium-transporter. To gain insight into the molecular basis for such strict promoter selectivity, we isolated OmpR mutants that can activate the non-cognate kdpABC promoter in vivo. For these OmpR mutants, it was found that a few common and crucial amino acids are responsible for the altered property of OmpR (e.g., Gly-164, Glu-193). In vitro properties of these OmpR mutants were further examined by means of DNA-binding assays and DNA-footprinting analyses with reference to the kdpABC promoter. These results were interpreted on the basis of the three-dimensional structure of the C-terminal half of OmpR, which consists of a DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motif and a RNA polymerase-interacting surface. The results of this study were best explained by assuming that the isolated OmpR mutants have an altered property with regard to the interaction with RNA polymerase on the kdpABC promoter.\nto identify novel motifs in addition to the known motifs responsible for TR function and its structural integrity. Understanding the diverse mechanisms employed by these TRs is essential for unraveling the biosynthesis of SSMs. This can also help exploit their regulatory role in biosynthesis for significant pharmaceutical, agricultural, and industrial applications. Comprehensive analysis of OmpR phosphorylation, dimerization, and DNA binding supports a canonical model for activation. The OmpR/PhoB family of response regulators (RRs) is the largest class of two-component system signal transduction proteins. Extensive biochemical and structural characterization of these transcription factors has provided insights into their activation and DNA-binding mechanisms. For the most part, OmpR/PhoB family proteins are thought to become activated through phosphorylation from their cognate histidine kinase partners, which in turn facilitates an allosteric change in the RR, enabling homodimerization and subsequently enhanced DNA binding. Incongruently, it has been suggested that OmpR, the eponymous member of this\nform a 1:1 complex detected by native PAGE. This indicates that two OmpR molecules can bind to one EnvZc dimer. As this 1:1 EnvZc/OmpR complex is formed even in the presence of a large excess of EnvZc, OmpR binding to EnvZc is co-operative. The complex formation is also observed between EnvZc and phosphorylated OmpR for the phosphatase reaction. OmpR-P bound to EnvZc was readily released upon the addition of OmpR, indicating that OmpR and OmpR-P can compete for the binding to EnvZ. On the basis of these results, a model is discussed to explain how cellular OmpR-P concentrations are regulated in response to medium osmolarity. The response regulator OmpR oligomerizes via beta-sheets to form head-to-head dimers. In Escherichia coli, the EnvZ/OmpR two-component regulatory system regulates expression of the porin genes ompF and ompC in response to changes in osmolarity. It has recently become apparent that OmpR functions as a global\nrepressor H-NS. These results reveal the underlying molecular mechanism that primes SPI genes for rapid induction at the onset of host invasion. Additionally, our results reveal novel features of the archetypal two-component regulator OmpR. OmpR binding to relaxed DNA appears to generate a locally supercoiled state, which may assist promoter activation by relocating supercoiling stress-induced destabilization of DNA strands. Much has been made of the mechanisms that have evolved to regulate horizontally-acquired genes such as SPIs, but parallels among the ssrA, hilC, and ompR promoters illustrate that a fundamental form of regulation based on DNA topology coordinates the expression of these genes regardless of their origins.",

Molecular Biology and Physiology of Volume-Regulated Anion Channel (VRAC). The Volume-Regulated Anion Channel (VRAC) is activated by cell swelling and plays a key\nexposed pocket that may be an interaction site for hydrophobic molecules. In the presence of Ca2+, TTYH2 and TTYH3 form homomeric cis-dimers bridged by extracellularly coordinated Ca2+. Strikingly, in the absence of Ca2+, TTYH2 forms trans-dimers that span opposing membranes across a ~130 \u00c5 intermembrane space as well as a monomeric state. All TTYH structures lack ion conducting pathways and we do not observe TTYH2-dependent channel activity in cells. We conclude TTYHs are not pore forming subunits of anion channels and their function may involve Ca2+-dependent changes in quaternary structure, interactions with hydrophobic molecules near the extracellular membrane surface, and/or association with additional protein partners.

The volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC), also known as the volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying (VSOR) anion channel or the volume-sensitive organic osmolyte/anion channel (VSOAC), is essential for cell volume regulation after swelling in\nintracellular signal transduction, a large variety of adhesion molecules and proteins potentially involved in regulating the functional and structural dynamics of the pre-synapse. Four maxi-channels, three isoforms of voltage-dependent anion channels and the tweety homolog 1 were co-isolated with the docked synaptic vesicles. As revealed by in situ hybridization, tweety homolog 1 reveals a distinct expression pattern in the rodent brain. Our results add novel information to the proteome of the presynaptic active zone and suggest that in particular proteins potentially involved in the short and long term structural modulation of the mature presynaptic compartment deserve further detailed analysis. Structural basis for assembly and lipid-mediated gating of LRRC8A:C volume-regulated anion channels. Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 8 (LRRC8) family members form volume-regulated anion channels activated by hypoosmotic cell swelling. LRRC8 channels are ubiquitously expressed in vertebrate cells as heteromeric assemblies of LRRC8A (SWELL1) and LRRC8B-E subunits. Channels of different subunit composition have\nthat LRRC8 proteins together constitute the VRAC pore and that hypotonic stress can activate VRAC through a decrease in cytoplasmic \u0393. Absolute Protein Amounts and Relative Abundance of Volume-regulated Anion Channel (VRAC) LRRC8 Subunits in Cells and Tissues Revealed by Quantitative Immunoblotting. The volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) plays an important role in osmotic cell volume regulation. In addition, it is involved in various physiological processes such as insulin secretion, glia-neuron communication and purinergic signaling. VRAC is formed by hetero-hexamers of members of the LRRC8 protein family, which consists of five members, LRRC8A-E. LRRC8A is an essential subunit for physiological functionality of VRAC. Its obligate heteromerization with at least one of its paralogues, LRRC8B-E, determines the biophysical properties of VRAC. Moreover, the subunit composition is of physiological relevance as it largely influences the activation mechanism and especially the substrate selectivity. However, the endogenous tissue-specific subunit composition of VRAC is unknown. We\nfor the formation of a functional VRAC. This review summarizes the biophysical and pharmacological properties of VRAC, highlights its main physiological functions and pathophysiological implications, and outlines the search for its molecular identity. Regulation of Anion Channel LRRC8 Volume-Regulated Anion Channels in Transport of 2'3'-Cyclic GMP-AMP and Cisplatin under Steady State and Inflammation. The recently identified anion channel LRRC8 volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) are heteromeric hexamers constituted with the obligate LRRC8A subunit paired with at least one of the accessory LRRC8B to LRRC8E subunits. In addition to transport chloride, taurine, and glutamate, LRRC8 VRACs also transport the anticancer agent cisplatin and STING agonists 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) and cyclic dinucleotides; hence, they are implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, such as cell swelling, stroke, cancer, and viral infection. Although the subunit composition largely determines VRAC substrate specificity, the opening of various VRAC pores under physiological and pathological settings\nPhysiology of Volume-Regulated Anion Channel (VRAC). The Volume-Regulated Anion Channel (VRAC) is activated by cell swelling and plays a key role in cell volume regulation. VRAC is ubiquitously expressed in vertebrate cells and also implicated in many other physiological and cellular processes including fluid secretion, glutamate release, membrane potential regulation, cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. Although its biophysical properties have been well characterized, the molecular identity of VRAC remained a mystery for almost three decades. The field was transformed by recent discoveries showing that the leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 8A (LRRC8A, also named SWELL1) and its four other homologs form heteromeric VRAC channels. The composition of LRRC8 subunits determines channel properties and substrate selectivity of a large variety of different VRACs. Incorporating purified SWELL1-containing protein complexes into lipid bilayers is sufficient to reconstitute channel activities, a finding that supports the decrease in intracellular ionic strength as the mechanism of VRAC activation\nrectifying (VSOR) anion channel or the volume-sensitive organic osmolyte/anion channel (VSOAC), is essential for cell volume regulation after swelling in most vertebrate cell types studied to date. In addition to its role in cell volume homeostasis, VRAC has been implicated in numerous other physiological and pathophysiological processes, including cancer, ischemic brain edema, cell motility, proliferation, angiogenesis, programmed cell death, and excitotoxic glutamate release. Although VRAC has been extensively biophysically, pharmacologically, and functionally characterized, its molecular identity was highly controversial until the recent identification of the leucine-rich repeats containing 8A (LRRC8A) protein as essential for the VRAC current in multiple cell types and a likely pore-forming subunit of VRAC. Members of this distantly pannexin-1-related protein family form heteromers, and in addition to LRRC8A, at least another LRRC8 family member is required for the formation of a functional VRAC. This review summarizes the biophysical and pharmacological properties of VRAC, highlights its main\nTTYH2 and TTYH3 reveal a Ca2+-dependent switch from intra- to intermembrane dimerization. Tweety homologs (TTYHs) comprise a conserved family of transmembrane proteins found in eukaryotes with three members (TTYH1-3) in vertebrates. They are widely expressed in mammals including at high levels in the nervous system and have been implicated in cancers and other diseases including epilepsy, chronic pain, and viral infections. TTYHs have been reported to form Ca2+- and cell volume-regulated anion channels structurally distinct from any characterized protein family with potential roles in cell adhesion, migration, and developmental signaling. To provide insight into TTYH family structure and function, we determined cryo-EM structures of Mus musculus TTYH2 and TTYH3 in lipid nanodiscs. TTYH2 and TTYH3 adopt a previously unobserved fold which includes an extended extracellular domain with a partially solvent exposed pocket that may be an interaction site for hydrophobic molecules. In the presence of Ca2+, TTYH2 and TTYH3 form\ninfluences the activation mechanism and especially the substrate selectivity. However, the endogenous tissue-specific subunit composition of VRAC is unknown. We have now developed and applied a quantitative immunoblot study of the five VRAC LRRC8 subunits in various mouse cell lines and tissues, using recombinant protein for signal calibration. We found tissue-specific expression patterns of the subunits, and generally relative low expression of the essential LRRC8A subunit. Immunoprecipitation of LRRC8A also co-precipitates an excess of the other subunits, suggesting that non-LRRC8A subunits present the majority in hetero-hexamers. With this, we can estimate that in the tested cell lines, the number of VRAC channels per cell is in the order of 10,000, which is in agreement with earlier calculations from the comparison of single-channel and whole-cell currents. Structures of tweety homolog proteins TTYH2 and TTYH3 reveal a Ca2+-dependent switch from intra- to intermembrane dimerization. Tweety homologs (TTYHs) comprise a conserved family of\nubiquitously expressed in vertebrate cells as heteromeric assemblies of LRRC8A (SWELL1) and LRRC8B-E subunits. Channels of different subunit composition have distinct properties that explain the functional diversity of LRRC8 currents across cell types. However, the basis for heteromeric LRRC8 channel assembly and function is unknown. Here we leverage a fiducial-tagging strategy to determine single-particle cryo-EM structures of heterohexameric LRRC8A:C channels in multiple conformations. Compared to homomers, LRRC8A:C channels show pronounced differences in architecture due to heterotypic LRR interactions that displace subunits away from the conduction axis and poise the channel for activation. Structures and functional studies further reveal that lipids embedded in the channel pore block ion conduction in the closed state. These results provide insight into determinants for heteromeric LRRC8 channel assembly, activity and gating by lipids. The ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4-2 differentially interacts with and regulates members of the Tweety family of chloride ion channels. The Tweety proteins comprise\nstructural characterization of murine LRRC8A/C channels. Like LRRC8A, these proteins assemble as hexamers. Despite 12 possible arrangements, we find a predominant organization with an A:C ratio of two. In this assembly, four LRRC8A subunits cluster in their preferred conformation observed in homomers, as pairs of closely interacting proteins that stabilize a closed state of the channel. In contrast, the two interacting LRRC8C subunits show a larger flexibility, underlining their role in the destabilization of the tightly packed A subunits, thereby enhancing the activation properties of the protein. Surface expression of TTYH2 is attenuated by direct interaction with \u03b2-COP. TTYH2 is a calcium-activated, inwardly rectifying anion channel that has been shown to be related to renal cancer and colon cancer. Based on the topological prediction, TTYH2 protein has five transmembrane domains with the extracellular N-terminus and the cytoplasmic C-terminus. In the present study, we identified a vesicle transport protein, \u03b2-COP, as\nto reconstitute channel activities, a finding that supports the decrease in intracellular ionic strength as the mechanism of VRAC activation during cell swelling. Characterization of Swell1 knockout mice uncovers the important role of VRAC in T cell development, pancreatic \u03b2-cell glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and adipocyte metabolic function. The ability to permeate organic osmolytes and metabolites is a major feature of VRAC. The list of VRAC substrates is expected to grow, now also including some cancer drugs and antibiotics even under non-cell swelling conditions. Therefore, a critical role of VRAC in drug resistance and cell-cell communication is emerging. This review summarizes the exciting recent progress on the structure-function relationship and physiology of VRAC and discusses key future questions to be solved. LRRC8 Proteins Form Volume-Regulated Anion Channels that Sense Ionic Strength. The volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) is activated when a cell swells, and it plays a central role in maintaining cell\nligase Nedd4-2 differentially interacts with and regulates members of the Tweety family of chloride ion channels. The Tweety proteins comprise a family of chloride ion channels with three members identified in humans (TTYH1-3) and orthologues in fly and murine species. In humans, increased TTYH2 expression is associated with cancer progression, whereas fly Tweety is associated with developmental processes. Structurally, Tweety proteins are characterized by five membrane-spanning domains and N-glycan modifications important for trafficking to the plasma membrane, where these proteins are oriented with the amino terminus located extracellularly and the carboxyl terminus cytoplasmically. In addition to N-glycosylation, ubiquitination mediated by the HECT type E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 is a post-translation modification important in regulating membrane proteins. In the present study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the ability of each of TTYH1-3 to interact with Nedd4-2 and to be ubiquitinated and regulated by this ligase. Our data indicate that Nedd4-2\nThe volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) is activated when a cell swells, and it plays a central role in maintaining cell volume in response to osmotic challenges. SWELL1 (LRRC8A) was recently identified as an essential component of VRAC. However, the identity of the pore-forming subunits of VRAC and how the channel is gated by cell swelling are unknown. Here, we show that SWELL1 and up to four other LRRC8 subunits assemble into heterogeneous complexes of \u223c800 kDa. When reconstituted into bilayers, LRRC8 complexes are sufficient to form anion channels activated by osmolality gradients. In bilayers, as well as in cells, the single-channel conductance of the complexes depends on the LRRC8 composition. Finally, low ionic strength (\u0393) in the absence of an osmotic gradient activates the complexes in bilayers. These data demonstrate that LRRC8 proteins together constitute the VRAC pore and that hypotonic stress can activate VRAC through a decrease in cytoplasmic\nand its association with VRACs. Corroborating a role for LRRC8A/D-containing VRACs in cisplatin transport, serum and TNF markedly potentiated cisplatin uptake and killing of cancer cells derived from human or mouse. Together, these observations provide new insights into the complex regulation of VRAC activation and suggest a novel approach to enhance the efficacy of cGAMP and cisplatin in treating infection and cancer. Structure of a volume-regulated heteromeric LRRC8A/C channel. Volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) participate in the cellular response to osmotic swelling. These membrane proteins consist of heteromeric assemblies of LRRC8 subunits, whose compositions determine permeation properties. Although structures of the obligatory LRRC8A, also referred to as SWELL1, have previously defined the architecture of VRACs, the organization of heteromeric channels has remained elusive. Here we have addressed this question by the structural characterization of murine LRRC8A/C channels. Like LRRC8A, these proteins assemble as hexamers. Despite 12 possible arrangements, we find a\nwith the extracellular N-terminus and the cytoplasmic C-terminus. In the present study, we identified a vesicle transport protein, \u03b2-COP, as a novel specific binding partner of TTYH2 by yeast two-hybrid screening using a human brain cDNA library with the C-terminal region of TTYH2 (TTYH2-C) as a bait. Using in vitro and in vivo binding assays, we confirmed the protein-protein interactions between TTYH2 and \u03b2-COP. We also found that the surface expression and activity of TTYH2 were decreased by co-expression with \u03b2-COP in the heterologous expression system. In addition, \u03b2-COP associated with TTYH2 in a native condition at a human colon cancer cell line, LoVo cells. The over-expression of \u03b2-COP in the LoVo cells led to a dramatic decrease in the surface expression and activity of endogenous TTYH2. Collectively, these data suggested that \u03b2-COP plays a critical role in the trafficking of the TTYH2 channel to the plasma membrane. [BMB Reports\nsuggested that \u03b2-COP plays a critical role in the trafficking of the TTYH2 channel to the plasma membrane. [BMB Reports 2019; 52(7): 445-450].\nThe proteome of the presynaptic active zone: from docked synaptic vesicles to adhesion molecules and maxi-channels. The presynaptic proteome controls neurotransmitter release and the short and long term structural and functional dynamics of the nerve terminal. Using a monoclonal antibody against synaptic vesicle protein 2 we immunopurified a presynaptic compartment containing the active zone with synaptic vesicles docked to the presynaptic plasma membrane as well as elements of the presynaptic cytomatrix. Individual protein bands separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were subjected to nanoscale-liquid chromatography electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Combining this method with 2-dimensional benzyldimethyl-n-hexadecylammonium chloride/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight and immunodetection we identified 240 proteins comprising synaptic vesicle proteins, components of the presynaptic fusion and retrieval machinery, proteins involved in intracellular signal transduction, a large variety of adhesion molecules and proteins potentially involved in regulating the functional and structural dynamics\nAlthough the subunit composition largely determines VRAC substrate specificity, the opening of various VRAC pores under physiological and pathological settings remains enigmatic. In this study, we demonstrated that VRACs comprising LRRC8A and LRRC8E (LRRC8A/E-containing VRACs), specialized in cGAMP transport, can be opened by a protein component present in serum under resting condition. Serum depletion ablated the tonic activity of LRRC8A/E-containing VRACs, decreasing cGAMP transport in various human and murine cells. Also, heating or proteinase K treatment abolished the ability of serum to activate VRAC. Genetic analyses revealed a crucial role for cGAMP synthase (cGAS) in serum/TNF-promoted VRAC activation. Notably, the presence of cGAS on the plasma membrane, rather than its DNA-binding or enzymatic activity, enabled VRAC activation. Moreover, phospholipid PIP2 seemed to be instrumental in the membrane localization of cGAS and its association with VRACs.

Here, we reported a newly cloned mosquito Aedes (Ae.) aegypti salivary allergen.METHODS: A cDNA encoding a 30-kDa Ae. aegypti salivary protein, designated Aed a 3, was isolated from an expression library. The full-length cDNA was cloned into a baculovirus expression vector, and recombinant Aed a 3 (rAed a 3) was expressed, purified, and characterized. Skin prick tests with purified rAed a 3 and Ae. aegypti bite tests were performed in 43 volunteers. Serum rAed a 3-specific IgE levels were measured in 28 volunteers.RESULTS: The primary nucleotide sequence, deduced amino acid sequence, and IgE-binding sites of Aed a 3 were identified. rAed a 3-selected antibodies recognized a 30-kDa Ae. aegypti saliva protein. rAed a 3 bound IgE in mosquito-allergic volunteers and the binding could be inhibited by the addition of natural mosquito extract dose dependently. Immediate skin test reactions to rAed\nthe binding could be inhibited by the addition of natural mosquito extract dose dependently. Immediate skin test reactions to rAed a 3 correlated significantly with mosquito bite-induced reactions. Of the bite test-positive volunteers, 32% had a positive rAed a 3 skin test and 46% had specific IgE. No bite test-negative volunteers reacted to rAed a 3 in either the skin tests or the IgE assays, confirming the specificity of the assay.CONCLUSIONS: Aed a 3 that corresponds to the Aegyptin protein is a major mosquito salivary allergen. Its recombinant form has biological activity and is suitable for use in skin tests and specific IgE assays in mosquito-allergic individuals. Characterization of dog allergens Can f 1 and Can f 2. 1. Preparation of their recombinant proteins and antibodies. BACKGROUND: Recombinant dog allergens, rCan f 1 and rCan f 2, and their antibodies are good tools for the characterization of dog allergens in\nper cent of 31 participants with a positive mosquito bite test had positive skin reactions to rAed a 2, compared with 32% for mosquito whole body extract. None of the participants with a negative bite test showed positive reactions to either of the two extracts. Forty-three per cent of individuals with positive saliva-IgE had positive rAed a 2-IgE. rAed a 2 was a species-shared allergen, being present in the saliva of the 11 species studied.CONCLUSIONS: rAed a 2 has identical antigenicity and biologic activity to its native form. It can be used in the diagnosis of mosquito allergy, and is an important species-shared antigen. Expression, purification, characterization and clinical relevance of rAed a 1--a 68-kDa recombinant mosquito Aedes aegypti salivary allergen. Accurate diagnosis of mosquito allergy has been precluded by the difficulty of obtaining salivary allergens. In this study, we expressed, purified, characterized and investigated the clinical relevance of a\nof eight of the recombinant allergens was demonstrated in intradermal skin testing. For the two characterized allergens Cul n 6 and Cul n 11, sensitized horses were not available for intradermal tests. Control horses without clinical signs of IBH did not develop any relevant immediate hypersensitivity reactions to the recombinant allergens. The major contribution of this study was to provide a repertoire of recombinant salivary gland allergens repertoire from C. nubeculosus potentially involved in the pathogenesis of IBH as a starting basis for the development of a component-resolved serologic diagnosis of IBH and, perhaps, for the development of single horse tailored specific immunotherapy depending on their component-resolved sensitization patterns. A new recombinant mosquito salivary allergen, rAed a 2: allergenicity, clinical relevance, and cross-reactivity. BACKGROUND: Mosquito salivary proteins cause allergic reactions in humans. The allergenicity, clinical relevance, and species cross-reactivity of a new 37-kDa recombinant mosquito (Aedes aegypti) salivary allergen, rAed\ncysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs). In this study we demonstrate that AnSt-D7L1, a two-domain member of this group from Anopheles stephensi, retains the CysLT binding function seen in the homolog AeD7 from Aedes aegypti but has lost the ability to bind biogenic amines. Unlike any previously characterized members of the D7 family, AnSt-D7L1 has acquired the important function of binding thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) and its analogs with high affinity. When administered to tissue preparations, AnSt-D7L1 abrogated Leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4))-induced contraction of guinea pig ileum and contraction of rat aorta by the TXA(2) analog U46619. The protein also inhibited platelet aggregation induced by both collagen and U46619 when administered to stirred platelets. The crystal structure of AnSt-D7L1 contains two OBP-like domains and has a structure similar to AeD7. In AnSt-D7L1, the binding pocket of the C-terminal domain has been rearranged relative to AeD7, making the protein unable to bind biogenic amines. Structures of\nin humans. The allergenicity, clinical relevance, and species cross-reactivity of a new 37-kDa recombinant mosquito (Aedes aegypti) salivary allergen, rAed a 2, were evaluated.METHODS: rAed a 2 was expressed using a baculovirus/insect cell system and purified. Its allergenicity was examined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), ELISA inhibition tests, immunoblots, and skin tests. Epicutaneous tests with the allergen, mosquito whole body extracts, and mosquito bite tests were performed on 48 volunteers. Serum rAed a 2-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) was measured in individuals with positive mosquito saliva-specific IgE and negative controls.RESULTS: Both immunoblots and ELISAs demonstrated that rAed a 2 bound to the IgE of mosquito-allergic individuals. The binding could be inhibited by the addition of a natural mosquito preparation. Furthermore, rAed a 2 induced immediate and delayed skin reactions. Ten per cent of 31 participants with a positive mosquito bite test had positive skin reactions to rAed a 2, compared\nmg/l of culture. The molecular weights of rCan f 1 and rCan f 2 were 18 and 20 kDa in SDS-PAGE, respectively. rCan f 1 and rCan f 2 were found to bind to specific IgE in the serum of dog allergy patients. The binding of IgE in the patient serum for dog saliva was partially inhibited in the presence of rCan f 1 and rCan f 2. These recombinant allergens showed positive signals in passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction and induced anaphylactic shock in the mouse model, resulting in a decrease in body temperature. The polyclonal rabbit antibody for rCan f 1 bound to a protein of 20 kDa in the salivary gland, saliva and hair/dander extracts of dogs. The rabbit antibody for rCan f 2 bound to proteins in the saliva and the hair/dander extracts. The proteins possessed a molecular weight of 22/ 23 kDa. Reverse transcription polymerase chain\na positive mosquito-bite test from a laboratory-reared mosquito. Sera from 18 individuals with a negative bite test served as controls.RESULTS: Purified rAed a 4 bound to the IgE in mosquito-allergic sera, as detected by ELISA and immunoblotting. The binding of rAed a 4 to IgE could be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of an A. aegypti extract. Mosquito-allergic individuals had significantly higher mean levels of rAed a 4-specific IgE and IgG than controls. Using the mean of the controls \u00b1 2 SD as a cut-off level, 46% of the 13 allergic individuals had a positive IgE, while none of the controls was positive (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Aed a 4 is a major allergen in mosquito saliva. Its recombinant form has the hydrolase function and can be used for the diagnosis of mosquito allergy. Multifunctionality and mechanism of ligand binding in a mosquito antiinflammatory protein. The mosquito D7\nproteins and that AaVA-1 showed a moderate interaction with DC-SIGN using ELISA. Bacteria responsive protein 1 (AgBR1), an Ae. aegypti saliva protein reported to enhance ZIKV infection in humans but that was not identified in our pull-down assay moderately interacts with CD4 in the ELISA assay. Functionally, we showed that AaVA-1 and NeST1 proteins promoted activation of CD4+ T cells. We propose the possible impact of these interactions and effects on mosquito-borne viral infections such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses. Overall, this study provides key insight into the vector-host (protein-protein) interaction network and suggests roles for these interactions in mosquito-borne viral infections. Mosquito salivary allergen Aed a 3: cloning, comprehensive molecular analysis, and clinical evaluation. BACKGROUND: Allergic reactions to mosquito bites are an increasing clinical concern. Due to the lack of availability of mosquito salivary allergens, they are underdiagnosed. Here, we reported a newly cloned mosquito Aedes (Ae.) aegypti\nrAed a 4: A New 67-kDa Aedes aegypti Mosquito Salivary Allergen for the Diagnosis of Mosquito Allergy. BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnosis of mosquito allergy has been hampered by the laborious task of obtaining mosquito salivary allergens. We have previously studied 3 recombinant (r) Aedes aegypti mosquito salivary allergens: rAed a 1, rAed a 2 and rAed a 3. Here, we report the expression, purification, identification and evaluation of rAed a 4, a 67-kDa \u03b1-glucosidase.METHODS: rAed a 4 was expressed using a baculovirus/insect cell system, purified by a combination of anion- and cation-exchange chromatography, and identified by immunoblotting. A. aegypti saliva extract was prepared in our laboratory. An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to measure rAed a 4-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and IgG antibodies in sera from 13 individuals with a positive mosquito-bite test from a laboratory-reared mosquito. Sera from 18 individuals with a negative bite test served as controls.RESULTS:\nfor the diagnosis of mosquito allergy. Multifunctionality and mechanism of ligand binding in a mosquito antiinflammatory protein. The mosquito D7 salivary proteins are encoded by a multigene family related to the arthropod odorant-binding protein (OBP) superfamily. Forms having either one or two OBP domains are found in mosquito saliva. Four single-domain and one two-domain D7 proteins from Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti (AeD7), respectively, were shown to bind biogenic amines with high affinity and with a stoichiometry of one ligand per protein molecule. Sequence comparisons indicated that only the C-terminal domain of AeD7 is homologous to the single-domain proteins from A. gambiae, suggesting that the N-terminal domain may bind a different class of ligands. Here, we describe the 3D structure of AeD7 and examine the ligand-binding characteristics of the N- and C-terminal domains. Isothermal titration calorimetry and ligand complex crystal structures show that the N-terminal domain binds cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs)\nthe saliva and the hair/dander extracts. The proteins possessed a molecular weight of 22/ 23 kDa. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed the presence of mRNA expression of Can f 1 and Can f 2 not only in the salivary gland but also in dog skin. A clear expression of Can f 2 mRNA was observed in dog skin.CONCLUSIONS: The recombinant allergens and antibodies for Can f 1 and Can f 2 are available for immunological and biochemical characterization of dog allergens. The molecular weight of the natural Can f 1 and Can f 2 in dog saliva and hair/dander extracts showed a higher molecular weight than that of rCan f 1 and rCan f 2. The significance of dog skin as the tissue producing dog allergens, especially Can f 2, should be considered in further studies.\nthe difficulty of obtaining salivary allergens. In this study, we expressed, purified, characterized and investigated the clinical relevance of a recombinant Aedes aegypti salivary allergen, rAed a 1. Two cDNA segments were ligated together to form the full-length Aed a 1 gene. rAed a 1 was expressed using a baculovirus/insect cell system, and purified using a combination of anion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography. The purified rAed a 1 bound to human IgE, as detected by ELISA, ELISA inhibition tests and immunoblot analyses. Epicutaneous tests with rAed a 1 and a commercial whole-body AE: aegypti extract, and AE: aegypti bite tests were performed in 48 subjects. Nine of 31 (29%) of the subjects with positive immediate bite tests also had a positive rAed a 1 immediate skin reaction and 32% had an positive immediate test to the commercial extract. Six of 33 (18%) of the subjects with positive delayed bite tests also\nreceptor proteins. Mosquito saliva proteins modulate the human immune and hemostatic systems and control mosquito-borne pathogenic infections. One mechanism through which mosquito proteins may influence host immunity and hemostasis is their interactions with key human receptor proteins that may act as receptors for or coordinate attacks against invading pathogens. Here, using pull-down assays and proteomics-based mass spectrometry, we identified 11 Ae. aegypti salivary gland proteins (SGPs) (e.g., apyrase, Ae. aegypti venom allergen-1 [AaVA-1], neutrophil stimulating protein 1 [NeSt1], and D7 proteins), that interact with one or more of five human receptor proteins (cluster of differentiation 4 [CD4], CD14, CD86, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin [DC-SIGN], and Toll-like receptor 4 [TLR4]). We focused on CD4- and DC-SIGN-interacting proteins and confirmed that CD4 directly interacts with AaVA-1, D7, and NeST1 recombinant proteins and that AaVA-1 showed a moderate interaction with DC-SIGN using ELISA. Bacteria responsive protein 1 (AgBR1), an Ae. aegypti\nof the C-terminal domain has been rearranged relative to AeD7, making the protein unable to bind biogenic amines. Structures of the ligand complexes show that CysLTs and TXA(2) analogs both bind in the same hydrophobic pocket of the N-terminal domain. The TXA(2) analog U46619 is stabilized by hydrogen bonding interactions of the \u03c9-5 hydroxyl group with the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr 52. LTC(4) and occupies a very similar position to LTE(4) in the previously determined structure of its complex with AeD7. As yet, it is not known what, if any, new function has been acquired by the rearranged C-terminal domain. This article presents, to our knowledge, the first structural characterization of a protein from mosquito saliva that inhibits collagen mediated platelet activation. Biochemical characterization of AeD7L2 and its physiological relevance in blood feeding in the dengue mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. Aedes aegypti saliva facilitates blood meal acquisition through pharmacologically\nbite hypersensitivity. Salivary gland proteins of Culicoides spp. have been suggested to be among the main allergens inducing IgE-mediated insect bite hypersensitivity (IBH), an allergic dermatitis of the horse. The aim of our study was to identify, produce and characterize IgE-binding salivary gland proteins of Culicoides nubeculosus relevant for IBH by phage surface display technology. A cDNA library constructed with mRNA derived from C. nubeculosus salivary glands was displayed on the surface of filamentous phage M13 and enriched for clones binding serum IgE of IBH-affected horses. Ten cDNA inserts encoding putative salivary gland allergens were isolated and termed Cul n 2 to Cul n 11. However, nine cDNA sequences coded for truncated proteins as determined by database searches. The cDNA sequences were amplified by PCR, subcloned into high level expression vectors and expressed as hexahistidine-tagged fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. Preliminary ELISA results obtained with these fusions confirmed the specific\npositive immediate test to the commercial extract. Six of 33 (18%) of the subjects with positive delayed bite tests also had a positive rAed a 1 delayed skin reaction and 6% had a positive delayed test to the commercial extract. Furthermore, rAed a 1-induced flare sizes significantly correlated with mosquito bite-induced flare sizes. None of the subjects with negative bite tests had a positive skin test to rAed a 1 or to commercial extract. We conclude that the rAed a 1 has identical antigenicity and biological activity to native Aed a 1, can be used in the in vitro and in vivo diagnosis of mosquito allergy, and is more sensitive than mosquito whole-body extract for detecting delayed skin reactions. Identification of Aedes aegypti salivary gland proteins interacting with human immune receptor proteins. Mosquito saliva proteins modulate the human immune and hemostatic systems and control mosquito-borne pathogenic infections. One mechanism through\nagainst blood loss, including vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, blood clotting, pain, and itching. The D7 proteins are some of the most abundantly expressed proteins in female mosquito salivary glands and have been implicated in inhibiting host hemostatic and inflammatory responses. Anopheles gambiae, the primary vector of malaria, expresses three D7 long-form and five D7 short-form proteins. Previous studies have characterized the AngaD7 short-forms, but the D7 long-form proteins have not yet been characterized in detail. Here, we characterized the A. gambiae D7 long-forms by first determining their binding kinetics to hemostatic agonists such as leukotrienes and serotonin, which are potent activators of vasoconstriction, edema formation, and postcapillary venule leakage, followed by ex vivo functional assays. We found that AngaD7L1 binds leukotriene C4 and thromboxane A2 analog U-46619; AngaD7L2 weakly binds leukotrienes B4 and D4; and AngaD7L3 binds serotonin. Subsequent functional assays confirmed AngaD7L1 inhibits U-46619-induced platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction, and AngaD7L3\nto interfere with the three branches of hemostasis: vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, and blood coagulation. Pressure myography experiments showed these two proteins reversed isolated resistance artery vasoconstriction induced by either norepinephrine or U-46619. These proteins also inhibited platelet aggregation induced by low doses of collagen or U-46619. However, D7 long proteins did not affect blood coagulation. The different ligand specificity and affinities of AeD7L1 and AeD7L2 matched our experimental observations from studying their effects on vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation, which confirm their role in preventing host hemostasis. This work highlights the complex yet highly specific biological activities of mosquito salivary proteins and serves as another example of the sophisticated biology underlying arthropod blood feeding. Selective cloning, characterization, and production of the Culicoides nubeculosus salivary gland allergen repertoire associated with equine insect bite hypersensitivity. Salivary gland proteins of Culicoides spp. have been suggested to be among the main allergens inducing IgE-mediated insect\nB4 and D4; and AngaD7L3 binds serotonin. Subsequent functional assays confirmed AngaD7L1 inhibits U-46619-induced platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction, and AngaD7L3 inhibits serotonin-induced platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. It is therefore possible that AngaD7L proteins counteract host hemostasis by scavenging these mediators. Finally, we demonstrate that AngaD7L2 had a dose-dependent anticoagulant effect via the intrinsic coagulation pathway by interacting with factors XII, XIIa, and XI. The uncovering of these interactions in the present study will be essential for comprehensive understanding of the vector-host biochemical interface. The function and three-dimensional structure of a thromboxane A2/cysteinyl leukotriene-binding protein from the saliva of a mosquito vector of the malaria parasite. The highly expressed D7 protein family of mosquito saliva has previously been shown to act as an anti-inflammatory mediator by binding host biogenic amines and cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs). In this study we demonstrate that AnSt-D7L1, a two-domain member of this group from Anopheles stephensi, retains",

Peters plus syndrome mutations affect the function and stability of human \u03b21,3-glucosyltransferase. Peters Plus Syndrome (PTRPLS OMIM #261540) is a severe congenital disorder of glycosylation where patients have multiple structural anomalies, including Peters anomaly of the eye (anterior segment dysgenesis), disproportionate short stature, brachydactyly, dysmorphic facial features, developmental delay, and variable additional abnormalities. PTRPLS patients and some Peters Plus-like (PTRPLS-like) patients (who only have a subset of PTRPLS phenotypes) have mutations in the gene encoding \u03b21,3-glucosyltransferase (B3GLCT). B3GLCT catalyzes the transfer of glucose to O-linked fucose on thrombospondin type-1 repeats. Most B3GLCT substrate proteins belong to the ADAMTS superfamily and play critical roles in extracellular matrix. We sought to determine whether the PTRPLS or PTRPLS-like mutations abrogated B3GLCT activity. B3GLCT has two putative active sites, one in the N-terminal region and the other in the C-terminal glycosyltransferase domain. Using sequence analysis and in vitro activity assays, we\ncorneal opacities interfering with vision in the United States The Peters\u2019 plus syndrome: a review Novel B3GALTL mutations in classic Peters plus syndrome and lack of mutations in a large cohort of patients with similar phenotypes Peters Plus syndrome is caused by mutations in B3GALTL, a putative glycosyltransferase Peters\u2019-plus syndrome is a congenital disorder of glycosylation caused by a defect in the beta1,3-glucosyltransferase that modifies thrombospondin type 1 repeats Peters plus syndrome mutations disrupt a noncanonical ER quality-control mechanism O-fucosylation of thrombospondin type 1 repeats in ADAMTS-like-1/punctin-1 regulates secretion: implications for the ADAMTS superfamily O-fucosylation is required for ADAMTS13 secretion Novel roles for O-linked glycans in protein folding A disintegrin-like and metalloprotease (reprolysin type) with thrombospondin type 1 motifs: the ADAMTS family Insights on ADAMTS proteases and ADAMTS-like proteins from mammalian genetics Characterization of ADAMTS-9 and ADAMTS-20 as a distinct ADAMTS subfamily related to Caenorhabditis elegans GON-1 Cooperation of two\nproviding additional evidence for the miRNA proxy hypothesis. O-Fucosylation of ADAMTSL2 is required for secretion and is impacted by geleophysic dysplasia-causing mutations. ADAMTSL2 mutations cause an autosomal recessive connective tissue disorder, geleophysic dysplasia 1 (GPHYSD1), which is characterized by short stature, small hands and feet, and cardiac defects. ADAMTSL2 is a matricellular protein previously shown to interact with latent transforming growth factor-\u03b2 binding protein 1 and influence assembly of fibrillin 1 microfibrils. ADAMTSL2 contains seven thrombospondin type-1 repeats (TSRs), six of which contain the consensus sequence for O-fucosylation by protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2). O-fucose-modified TSRs are subsequently elongated to a glucose \u03b21-3-fucose (GlcFuc) disaccharide by \u03b21,3-glucosyltransferase (B3GLCT). B3GLCT mutations cause Peters Plus Syndrome (PTRPLS), which is characterized by skeletal defects similar to GPHYSD1. Several ADAMTSL2 TSRs also have consensus sequences for C-mannosylation. Six reported GPHYSD1 mutations occur within the TSRs and two lie near O-fucosylation sites. To investigate the effects\nbrachydactyly, as well as a variable incidence of cleft palate, intellectual disability, genitourinary anomalies and heart defects. Classic PPS (obligate triad of Peters anomaly, short stature and brachydactyly) is due to mutations in B3GLCT, previously known as B3GALTL, which encodes a \u03b21,3-glucosyltransferase, and is thus a congenital disorder of glycosylation. B3GLCT is an exquisitely specific enzyme, which appends glucose to O-linked fucose (O-fucose) added by protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2) only to thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs). Together, these two enzymes generate a Ser/Thr-linked Glucose\u03b21-3Fucose disaccharide. POFUT2 and B3GLCT act in the endoplasmic reticulum and exclusively modify correctly folded TSRs, providing a quality control mechanism regulating the secretion of TSR-containing proteins. The specificity of B3GLCT is pre-determined by POFUT2, which modifies Ser/Thr residues (underlined) within the defined consensus sequence CXX(S/T)CXXG in TSRs, which is found in 49 proteins encoded by the human and mouse genomes. Although POFUT2 is related to POFUT1,\nimmunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence. Cornea cell density and thickness were quantified on DAPI stained sections using ImageJ\u00ae software. For immunofluorescence, sections were subjected to microwave heating in 10 mM sodium citrate-EDTA pH 6.2 for 4 \u00d7 1.5 min, followed by gradual cooling to ambient temperature or by incubation with 5 \u03bcg/ml proteinase K (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 3 min at room temperature (for anti-laminin and anti-collagen IV immunostaining).

Target prediction suffers from low accuracy and a high false prediction rate. Herein, we develop a high-throughput experimental platform to analyze miR-target interactions, miRFluR. We utilize this system to analyze the interactions of the entire human miRome with beta-3-glucosyltransferase (B3GLCT), a glycosylation enzyme whose loss underpins the congenital disorder Peters' Plus Syndrome. Although this enzyme is predicted by multiple algorithms to be highly targeted by miRs, we identify only 27 miRs that downregulate B3GLCT, a >96% false positive rate for prediction. Functional enrichment analysis of these validated miRs predicts phenotypes associated with Peters' Plus Syndrome, although B3GLCT is not in their known target network. Thus, biological phenotypes driven by B3GLCT may be driven by the target networks of miRs that regulate this enzyme, providing additional evidence for the miRNA proxy hypothesis. O-Fucosylation of ADAMTSL2 is required for secretion and is impacted by geleophysic\nor more of four C-mannosyltransferases. O-fucosylation by POFUT2/B3GLCT in the endoplasmic reticulum has been proposed to play a role in quality control by locking TSR domains into their three-dimensional fold, allowing for proper secretion of many O-fucosylated substrates. Prior studies showed the siRNA knockdown of POFUT2 in HEK293T cells blocked secretion of TSRs 1-3 from THBS1. Here we demonstrated that secretion of THBS1 TSRs 1-3 was not reduced by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of POFUT2 in HEK293T cells and demonstrated that knockout of Pofut2 or B3glct in mice did not reduce the trafficking of endogenous THBS1 to secretory granules of platelets, a major source of THBS1. Additionally, we demonstrated that all three TSRs from platelet THBS1 were highly C-mannosylated, which has been shown to stabilize TSRs in vitro. Combined, these results suggested that POFUT2 substrates with TSRs that are also modified by C-mannose may be less susceptible to trafficking defects resulting from\nthose observed in PTRPLS-like patients. O-fucosylation stabilizes the TSR3 motif in thrombospondin-1 by interacting with nearby amino acids and protecting a disulfide bond. Thrombospondin type-1 repeats (TSRs) are small protein motifs containing six conserved cysteines forming three disulfide bonds that can be modified with an O-linked fucose. Protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2) catalyzes the addition of O-fucose to TSRs containing the appropriate consensus sequence, and the O-fucose modification can be elongated to a Glucose-Fucose disaccharide with the addition of glucose by \u03b23-glucosyltransferase (B3GLCT). Elimination of Pofut2 in mice results in embryonic lethality in mice, highlighting the biological significance of O-fucose modification on TSRs. Knockout of POFUT2 in HEK293T cells has been shown to cause complete or partial loss of secretion of many proteins containing O-fucosylated TSRs. In addition, POFUT2 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and only modifies folded TSRs, stabilizing their structures. These observations suggest that POFUT2 is involved\nmonoclonal antibody (dilution:1/100; catalog number 610181, BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-\u03b1-smooth muscle actin Cy3 coupled mouse monoclonal antibody (dilution:1/200; catalog number C6198, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-fibrillin-2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (dilution:1/500; kindly provided by Robert Mecham), anti-fibronectin rabbit polyclonal antibody (dilution:1/500; catalog number AB2033, Millipore, Billerica, MA), anti-versican GAG\u03b2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (dilution: 1/500, catalog number AB1033, Millipore), anti-DPEAAE rabbit polyclonal antibody (dilution:1/500; catalog number PA1-1748A, Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), anti-Ki67 (dilution:1/100; clone SP6, Thermo-Fisher Scientific).

Collagen IV and laminin immunostaining of\nacquired \u03b1-SMA and N-cadherin expression. In addition to Peters anomaly, corneal invasion by lens epithelium, lens capsule deposition in the corneal stroma, as well as increased keratocyte density are together likely to be significant contributors to corneal opacity. We propose that the consecutive changes we observed comprise a pathogenic sequence arising from a flawed lens capsule. Of 49 known B3GLCT targets, ADAMTS9 is the first to be associated with Peters anomaly. The similarities between the ocular phenotype of Adamts9del/+ mice and the ocular phenotype of PPS in humans suggests ADAMTS9 as the first B3GLCT substrate whose impairment potentially explains the ocular anomalies of PPS. In strong support of this possibility, we have further shown, 1. That several ADAMTS9 TSRs are O-fucosylated, 2. That B3GLCT or POFUT2 knockdown, i.e. defective O-fucosylation, is essential for ADAMTS9 secretion and 3. That Adamts9, B3glct and Pofut2 have overlapping expression in the eye throughout development.\na potential space in the most severely affected eyes (Fig. 1c,d). Although the anterior chamber volume was reduced in most Adamts9del/+ eyes, comparison with wild-type chamber volumes did not reach statistical significance owing to the considerable variability of ASD and the presence of buphthalmos (enlarged eye) in at least one Adamts9del/+ eye (Fig. 1e). Peters anomaly, never seen in the wild-type eyes, was identified by OCT in 3-week-old Adamts9del/+ eyes having the central corneal contour anomaly and confirmed histologically by observation of lens-cornea adhesion with disrupted posterior corneal layers, and iridocorneal adhesions (anterior synechiae) (Fig. 1c,f, Table 1). Adamts9del/+ eyes had a smaller lens (Fig. 1g) and some eyes showed ciliary body hypoplasia/dysplasia, signs of vacuolar cataract and persistence of lens fiber nuclei in the posterior lens, none of which were seen in wild-type littermates (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. S1b\u2013d). No histological anomalies of the retina, RPE and choroid were\nMass spectral analysis reveals that TSRs from mature, secreted protein are stoichiometrically modified with the disaccharide, whereas TSRs from protein still folding in the ER are partially modified, suggesting that O-glycosylation marks folded TSRs and promotes ER exit. In vitro unfolding assays demonstrate that fucose and glucose stabilize folded TSRs in an additive manner. In vitro refolding assays under redox conditions showed that POFUT2 recognizes, glycosylates, and stabilizes the folded form of TSRs, resulting in a net acceleration of folding.CONCLUSIONS: While known ER quality-control machinery rely on identifying and tagging unfolded proteins, we find that POFUT2 and B3GLCT mediate a noncanonical ER quality-control mechanism that recognizes folded TSRs and stabilizes them by glycosylation. Our findings provide a molecular basis for the defects observed in PPS and potential targets that contribute to the pathology. Peters plus syndrome mutations affect the function and stability of human \u03b21,3-glucosyltransferase. Peters Plus Syndrome (PTRPLS OMIM\nfrom the collective effects of the mutation on multiple processes. ADAMTS9 and ADAMTS20 are differentially affected by loss of B3GLCT in mouse model of Peters plus syndrome. Peters plus syndrome (MIM #261540 PTRPLS), characterized by defects in eye development, prominent forehead, hypertelorism, short stature and brachydactyly, is caused by mutations in the \u03b23-glucosyltransferase (B3GLCT) gene. Protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2) and B3GLCT work sequentially to add an O-linked glucose \u03b21-3fucose disaccharide to properly folded thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs). Forty-nine proteins are predicted to be modified by POFUT2, and nearly half are members of the ADAMTS superfamily. Previous studies suggested that O-linked fucose is essential for folding and secretion of POFUT2-modified proteins and that B3GLCT-mediated extension to the disaccharide is essential for only a subset of targets. To test this hypothesis and gain insight into the origin of PTRPLS developmental defects, we developed and characterized two mouse B3glct knockout alleles. Using\nO-fucosylation on TSR3 and impaired ADAMTSL2 secretion. Peters plus syndrome mutations disrupt a noncanonical ER quality-control mechanism. BACKGROUND: O-fucose is added to cysteine-rich domains called thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs) by protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2) and is elongated with glucose by \u03b23-glucosyltransferase (B3GLCT). Mutations in B3GLCT result in Peters plus syndrome (PPS), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by eye and other developmental defects. Although 49 putative targets are known, the function of the disaccharide and its role in PPS remain unexplored.RESULTS: Here we show that while POFUT2 is required for secretion of all targets tested, B3GLCT only affects the secretion of a subset, consistent with the observation that B3GLCT mutant phenotypes in PPS patients are less severe than embryonic lethal phenotypes of Pofut2-null mice. O-glycosylation occurs cotranslationally, as TSRs fold. Mass spectral analysis reveals that TSRs from mature, secreted protein are stoichiometrically modified with the disaccharide, whereas TSRs from protein\nthe ions corresponding to those sites were not detected. (*=contaminating peptide). POFUT2 is indispensable for ADAMTS9 secretion whereas B3GLCT is required for optimal secretion. (a) HEK293T cells were co-transfected with siRNA targeting POFUT2, or B3GLCT, or a non-targeting control (Neg. Ctrl.), and hADAMTS9-N-L2 or human IgG heavy chain. Media and lysates were analyzed by western blotting with anti-myc (hADAMTS9-N-L2) or anti-human IgG. ADAMTS-N-L2 in medium migrates more rapidly compared to the cell lysate because the N-terminal propeptide (~25 kDa) is excised by furin at the cell-surface. The western blot images are cropped from gels which were provided for review as Supplementary information (Supplementary Fig. S7). (b) Quantitation of data from the western blot is shown relative to the control siRNA (Neg. Ctrl.). Data are mean+/\u2212 standard deviation (n = 3). Significance was determined using a 2-tailed Student\u2019s t test (*p < 0.005, #p < 0.001). Summary of eye phenotypes in\nHydrocephalus in mouse B3glct mutants is likely caused by defects in multiple B3GLCT substrates in ependymal cells and subcommissural organ. Peters plus syndrome, characterized by defects in eye and skeletal development with isolated cases of ventriculomegaly/hydrocephalus, is caused by mutations in the \u03b23-glucosyltransferase (B3GLCT) gene. In the endoplasmic reticulum, B3GLCT adds glucose to O-linked fucose on properly folded thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs). The resulting glucose-fucose disaccharide is proposed to stabilize the TSR fold and promote secretion of B3GLCT substrates, with some substrates more sensitive than others to loss of glucose. Mouse B3glct mutants develop hydrocephalus at high frequency. In this study, we demonstrated that B3glct mutant ependymal cells had fewer cilia basal bodies and altered translational polarity compared to controls. Localization of mRNA encoding A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with ThromboSpondin type 1 repeat 20 (ADAMTS20) and ADAMTS9 suggested that reduced function of these B3GLCT substrates contributed to ependymal cell",

        "desc": "of BicD autoinhibition following cargo binding to the neighboring, homotypic coiled-coil region. Overall, our data reveal a pivotal role of a highly asymmetric coiled-coil domain in coordinating the assembly of cargo-motor complexes. Interactions between coiled-coil proteins: Drosophila lamin Dm0 binds to the bicaudal-D protein. In a yeast two-hybrid screen we identified an interaction between Drosophila lamin Dm0, a structural nuclear protein, and BICD, a protein involved in oocyte development. The interaction can be reconstituted in vitro and takes place between segments of both proteins predicted to form coiled coils. The affinity for lamin Dm0 of the minimal binding site on BICD is modulated in a complex fashion by other BICD segments. A point mutation, F684I, that causes the dominant, bicaudal, Bic-D phenotype inhibits lamin binding in the context of the minimal lamin-binding site, but not in a larger BICD fragment. The minimal lamin-binding site of BICD binds to a few\nneeded for pronuclear fusion, suggesting that the underlying mechanism might be more widely used across species. Bicaudal-D binds clathrin heavy chain to promote its transport and augments synaptic vesicle recycling. Cargo transport by microtubule-based motors is essential for cell organisation and function. The Bicaudal-D (BicD) protein participates in the transport of a subset of cargoes by the minus-end-directed motor dynein, although the full extent of its functions is unclear. In this study, we report that in Drosophila zygotic BicD function is only obligatory in the nervous system. Clathrin heavy chain (Chc), a major constituent of coated pits and vesicles, is the most abundant protein co-precipitated with BicD from head extracts. BicD binds Chc directly and interacts genetically with components of the pathway for clathrin-mediated membrane trafficking. Directed transport and subcellular localisation of Chc is strongly perturbed in BicD mutant presynaptic boutons. Functional assays show that BicD and dynein are essential\ncomplex is loaded through Dlc onto the dynein motor complex thereby facilitating transport of cargo. Consistent with this model, point mutations that specifically disrupt Egl-Dlc association also disrupt microtubule-dependant trafficking both to and within the oocyte, resulting in a loss of oocyte fate maintenance and polarity. Our data provide a direct link between a molecule necessary for oocyte specification and the microtubule motor complex, and supports the hypothesis that microtubule-mediated transport is important for preserving oocyte fate. Female meiosis II and pronuclear fusion require the microtubule transport factor Bicaudal D. Bicaudal D (BicD) is a dynein adaptor that transports different cargoes along microtubules. Reducing the activity of BicD specifically in freshly laid Drosophila eggs by acute protein degradation revealed that BicD is needed to produce normal female meiosis II products, to prevent female meiotic products from re-entering the cell cycle, and for pronuclear fusion. Given that BicD is required to\nto prevent female meiotic products from re-entering the cell cycle, and for pronuclear fusion. Given that BicD is required to localize the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) components Mad2 and BubR1 to the female meiotic products, it appears that BicD functions to localize these components to control metaphase arrest of polar bodies. BicD interacts with Clathrin heavy chain (Chc), and both proteins localize to centrosomes, mitotic spindles and the tandem spindles during female meiosis II. Furthermore, BicD is required to localize clathrin and the microtubule-stabilizing factors transforming acidic coiled-coil protein (D-TACC/Tacc) and Mini spindles (Msps) correctly to the meiosis II spindles, suggesting that failure to localize these proteins may perturb SAC function. Furthermore, immediately after the establishment of the female pronucleus, D-TACC and Caenorhabditis elegans BicD, tacc and Chc are also needed for pronuclear fusion, suggesting that the underlying mechanism might be more widely used across species. Bicaudal-D binds clathrin heavy\ncomplexes within neurites by microtubule-based motors. However, the mechanisms that link FMRP to motors and regulate its transport are poorly understood. Here we show that FMRP is complexed with Bicaudal-D (BicD) through a domain in the latter protein that mediates linkage of cargoes with the minus-end-directed motor dynein. We demonstrate in Drosophila that the motility and, surprisingly, levels of FMRP protein are dramatically reduced in BicD mutant neurons, leading to a paucity of FMRP within processes. We also provide functional evidence that BicD and FMRP cooperate to control dendritic morphogenesis in the larval nervous system. Our findings open new perspectives for understanding localized mRNA functions in neurons. Dynein light chain-dependent dimerization of Egalitarian is essential for maintaining oocyte fate in Drosophila. Egalitarian (Egl) is an RNA adaptor for the Dynein motor and is thought to link numerous, perhaps hundreds, of mRNAs with Dynein. Dynein, in turn, is responsible for the\nThe Egalitarian binding partners Dynein light chain and Bicaudal-D act sequentially to link mRNA to the Dynein motor. A conserved mechanism of polarity establishment is the localization of mRNA to specific cellular regions. Although it is clear that many mRNAs are transported along microtubules, much less is known about the mechanism by which these mRNAs are linked to microtubule motors. The RNA binding protein Egalitarian (Egl) is necessary for localization of several mRNAs in Drosophila oocytes and embryos. Egl also interacts with Dynein light chain (Dlc) and Bicaudal-D (BicD). The role of Dlc and BicD in mRNA localization has remained elusive. Both proteins are required for oocyte specification, as is Egl. Null alleles in these genes result in an oogenesis block. In this report, we used an shRNA-depletion strategy to overcome the oogenesis block. Our findings reveal that the primary function of Dlc is to promote Egl dimerization. Loss of\nseemingly divergent mRNA elements. Here we provide evidence that direct recognition of these mRNA localization signals is mediated by the Egalitarian (Egl) protein. Egl and the dynein cofactor Bicaudal-D (BicD) are the only proteins from embryonic extracts that are abundantly and specifically enriched on RNA localization signals from transcripts of gurken, hairy, K10, and the I factor retrotransposon. In vitro assays show that, despite lacking a canonical RNA-binding motif, Egl directly recognizes active localization elements. We also reveal a physical interaction between Egl and a conserved domain for cargo recruitment in BicD and present data suggesting that Egl participates selectively in BicD-mediated transport of mRNA in vivo. Our work leads to the first working model for a complete connection between minus-end-directed mRNA localization signals and microtubules and reveals molecular strategies that are likely to be of general relevance for cargo transport by dynein. A novel protease-activated receptor-1 interactor, Bicaudal D1,\nthat are likely to be of general relevance for cargo transport by dynein. A novel protease-activated receptor-1 interactor, Bicaudal D1, regulates G protein signaling and internalization. Protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays critical roles in cancer, angiogenesis, inflammation, and thrombosis. Proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain of PAR1 generates a tethered ligand that activates PAR1 in an unusual intramolecular mode. The signal emanating from the irreversibly cleaved PAR1 is terminated by G protein uncoupling and internalization; however, the mechanisms of PAR1 signal shut off still remain unclear. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified Bicaudal D1 (BicD1) as a direct interactor with the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PAR1. BICD was originally identified as an essential developmental gene associated with mRNA and Golgi-endoplasmic reticulum transport. We discovered a novel function of BicD1 in the modulation of G protein signaling, cell proliferation, and endocytosis downstream of PAR1. BicD1\nregion of the dynein adaptor Bicaudal-D (BicD), which reveals a parallel coiled-coil homodimer. We identify a shared binding site for two cargo-associated proteins-Rab6 and the RNA-binding protein Egalitarian (Egl)-within a region of the BicD structure with classical, homotypic core packing. Structure-based mutagenesis in Drosophila provides evidence that occupancy of this site drives association of BicD with dynein, thereby coupling motor recruitment to cargo availability. The structure also contains a region in which, remarkably, the same residues in the polypeptide sequence have different heptad registry in each chain. In vitro and in vivo analysis of a classical Drosophila dominant mutation reveals that this heterotypic region regulates the recruitment of dynein to BicD. Our results support a model in which the heterotypic segment is part of a molecular switch that promotes release of BicD autoinhibition following cargo binding to the neighboring, homotypic coiled-coil region. Overall, our data reveal a pivotal role of\novercome the oogenesis block. Our findings reveal that the primary function of Dlc is to promote Egl dimerization. Loss of dimerization compromises the ability of Egl to bind RNA. Consequently, Egl is not bound to cargo, and is not able to efficiently associate with BicD and the Dynein motor. Our results therefore identify the key molecular steps required for assembling a localization-competent mRNP. Bicaudal-D regulates fragile X mental retardation protein levels, motility, and function during neuronal morphogenesis. The expression of the RNA-binding factor Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is disrupted in the most common inherited form of cognitive deficiency in humans. FMRP controls neuronal morphogenesis by mediating the translational regulation and localization of a large number of mRNA targets, and these functions are closely associated with transport of FMRP complexes within neurites by microtubule-based motors. However, the mechanisms that link FMRP to motors and regulate its transport are poorly\ncargo binding and autoinhibition of Bicaudal-D1 by a parallel coiled-coil with homotypic registry. Bicaudal-D1 (BICD1) is an \u03b1-helical coiled-coil protein mediating the attachment of specific cargo to cytoplasmic dynein. It plays an essential role in minus end-directed intracellular transport along microtubules. The third C-terminal coiled-coil region of BICD1 (BICD1 CC3) has an important role in cargo sorting, including intracellular vesicles associating with the small GTPase Rab6 and the nuclear pore complex Ran binding protein 2 (RanBP2), and inhibiting the association with cytoplasmic dynein by binding to the first N-terminal coiled-coil region (CC1). The crystal structure of BICD1 CC3 revealed a parallel homodimeric coiled-coil with asymmetry and complementary knobs-into-holes interactions, differing from Drosophila BicD CC3. Furthermore, our binding study indicated that BICD1 CC3 possesses a binding surface for two distinct cargos, Rab6 and RanBP2, and that the CC1-binding site overlaps with the Rab6-binding site. These findings suggest a molecular basis for\na novel function of BicD1 in the modulation of G protein signaling, cell proliferation, and endocytosis downstream of PAR1. BicD1 and its C-terminal CC3 domain inhibited PAR1 signaling to G(q)-phospholipase C-beta through coiled-coil interactions with the cytoplasmic 8th helix of PAR1. Unexpectedly, BicD1 was also found to be a potent suppressor of PAR1-driven proliferation of breast carcinoma cells. The growth-suppressing effects of BicD1 required the ability to interact with the 8th helix of PAR1. Silencing of BicD1 expression impaired endocytosis of PAR1, and BicD1 co-localized with PAR1 and tubulin, implicating BicD1 as an important adapter protein involved in the transport of PAR1 from the plasma membrane to endosomal vesicles. Together, these findings provide a link between PAR1 signal termination and internalization through the non-G protein effector, BicD1. Structural basis for cargo binding and autoinhibition of Bicaudal-D1 by a parallel coiled-coil with homotypic registry. Bicaudal-D1 (BICD1) is an \u03b1-helical coiled-coil protein\nminimal lamin-binding site, but not in a larger BICD fragment. The minimal lamin-binding site of BICD binds to a few other coiled-coil proteins, but binding to these proteins is not influenced by the F684I point mutation, suggesting that the interaction with lamin may play a role in Bic-D function. Our structural studies demonstrated that BICD is 60-70% alpha-helical, is a dimer, and consists of two parts: a thin rod-shaped part of about 32 nm, and a thicker rod-shaped part of about 26 nm. Likely, the thinner rod-shaped part of full-length BICD consists of the N-terminal half of the protein, and the lamin-binding site is located within the thicker rod-shaped part. Egalitarian binds dynein light chain to establish oocyte polarity and maintain oocyte fate. In many cell types polarized transport directs the movement of mRNAs and proteins from their site of synthesis to their site of action, thus conferring cell polarity.\nrestored BicD binding, it only partially restored mRNA binding. As a result, Egl-dependent phenotypes, such as oocyte specification and mRNA localization, were only partially rescued. We hypothesize that Dlc-mediated dimerization of Egl results in a three-dimensional conformation of the Egl dimer that is best suited for mRNA binding. Although the leucine zipper restores Egl dimerization, it likely does not enable Egl to assemble into the conformation required for maximal mRNA binding activity. Bicaudal-D uses a parallel, homodimeric coiled coil with heterotypic registry to coordinate recruitment of cargos to dynein. Cytoplasmic dynein is the major minus end-directed microtubule motor in eukaryotes. However, there is little structural insight into how different cargos are recognized and linked to the motor complex. Here we describe the 2.2 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of a cargo-binding region of the dynein adaptor Bicaudal-D (BicD), which reveals a parallel coiled-coil homodimer. We identify a shared binding site for\nthe movement of mRNAs and proteins from their site of synthesis to their site of action, thus conferring cell polarity. The cytoplasmic dynein microtubule motor complex is involved in this process. In Drosophila melanogaster, the Egalitarian (Egl) and Bicaudal-D (BicD) proteins are also essential for the transport of macromolecules to the oocyte and to the apical surface of the blastoderm embryo. Hence, Egl and BicD, which have been shown to associate, may be part of a conserved core localization machinery in Drosophila, although a direct association between these molecules and the dynein motor complex has not been shown. Here we report that Egl interacts directly with Drosophila dynein light chain (Dlc), a microtubule motor component, through an Egl domain distinct from that which binds BicD. We propose that the Egl-BicD complex is loaded through Dlc onto the dynein motor complex thereby facilitating transport of cargo. Consistent with this model, point\nlocalisation of Chc is strongly perturbed in BicD mutant presynaptic boutons. Functional assays show that BicD and dynein are essential for the maintenance of normal levels of neurotransmission specifically during high-frequency electrical stimulation and that this is associated with a reduced rate of recycling of internalised synaptic membrane. Our results implicate BicD as a new player in clathrin-associated trafficking processes and show a novel requirement for microtubule-based motor transport in the synaptic vesicle cycle. Egalitarian is a selective RNA-binding protein linking mRNA localization signals to the dynein motor. Cytoplasmic sorting of mRNAs by microtubule-based transport is widespread, yet very little is known at the molecular level about how specific transcripts are linked to motor complexes. In Drosophila, minus-end-directed transport of developmentally important transcripts by the dynein motor is mediated by seemingly divergent mRNA elements. Here we provide evidence that direct recognition of these mRNA localization signals is mediated by the\nmotor and is thought to link numerous, perhaps hundreds, of mRNAs with Dynein. Dynein, in turn, is responsible for the transport and localization of these mRNAs. Studies have shown that efficient mRNA binding by Egl requires the protein to dimerize. We recently demonstrated that Dynein light chain (Dlc) is responsible for facilitating the dimerization of Egl. Mutations in Egl that fail to interact with Dlc do not dimerize, and as such, are defective for mRNA binding. Consequently, this mutant does not efficiently associate with BicaudalD (BicD), the factor responsible for linking the Egl/mRNA complex with Dynein. In this report, we tested whether artificially dimerizing this Dlc-binding mutant using a leucine zipper would restore mRNA binding and rescue mutant phenotypes in vivo. Interestingly, we found that although artificial dimerization of Egl restored BicD binding, it only partially restored mRNA binding. As a result, Egl-dependent phenotypes, such as oocyte specification and mRNA\nRab6 and RanBP2, and that the CC1-binding site overlaps with the Rab6-binding site. These findings suggest a molecular basis for cargo recognition and autoinhibition of BICD proteins during dynein-dependent intracellular retrograde transport.",

Mutations in KCNQ1 underlie the most common type of hereditary long QT syndrome (LQTS). Like other potassium channels, KCNQ1 has six transmembrane domains and a highly conserved potassium selectivity filter in the pore helix called \"the signature sequence.\" We aimed to investigate the functional consequences of a newly identified mutation within the signature sequence.METHODS AND RESULTS: Potassium channel genomic DNA from a family with clinical evidence of LQTS was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the resulting products were then sequenced.

A yeast screen for active Kir3.2 channels subjected to random mutagenesis has identified residues in the transmembrane segments that are crucial for controlling the opening of Kir3.2 channels. The identification of structural elements involved in potassium channel gating in these systems highlights principles that may be important in the regulation of other types of channels. Dynamic rearrangement of the intrinsic ligand regulates KCNH potassium channels. KCNH voltage-gated potassium channels (EAG, ERG, and ELK) play significant roles in neuronal and cardiac excitability. They contain cyclic nucleotide-binding homology domains (CNBHDs) but are not directly regulated by cyclic nucleotides. Instead, the CNBHD ligand-binding cavity is occupied by an intrinsic ligand, which resides at the intersubunit\nKCNH family. Comparison of ERG (KCNH2), EAG (KCNH1), ELK (KCNH3), CNG, HCN and Kv (KCNMA) channels. KCNH channels comprise the ERG (ether \u00e1 go-go related, KCNH2), EAG (ether \u00e1 go-go, KCNH1), and ELK (ether \u00e1 go-go like; KCNH3) families of voltage-activated potassium channels and are separated into different groups based on homology (Figure 1). ERG, EAG, and ELK channels are homologous to the CNG (cyclic nucleotide-gated) and HCN (hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-regulated) channels. KCNH channels are more closely related to CNG and HCN channels than to other voltage-activated (Kv, KCNMA) K channels.

Schematic of voltage-activation relationships for D) ERG, E) EAG and F) ELK channels. ERG1 is distinguished from other KCNHs because ERG1 is expressed in the mammalian myocardium and forms the native IKr\npores. Subsequent animal studies revealed the developmental functions of Kcnb1-containing voltage-gated potassium channels and illustrated their role during brain development and reproduction. These functions of potassium channels are discussed in this review in the context of regulatory interactions between electrically-active and regulatory subunits. Heteromeric KV2/KV8.2 Channels Mediate Delayed Rectifier Potassium Currents in Primate Photoreceptors. Silent voltage-gated potassium channel subunits (KVS) interact selectively with members of the KV2 channel family to modify their functional properties. The localization and functional roles of these silent subunits remain poorly understood. Mutations in the KVS subunit, KV8.2 (KCNV2), lead to severe visual impairment in humans, but the basis of these deficits remains unclear. Here, we examined the localization, native interactions, and functional properties of KV8.2-containing channels in mouse, macaque, and human photoreceptors of either sex. In human retina, KV8.2 colocalized with KV2.1 and KV2.2 in cone inner segments and with KV2.1 in rod inner segments.\nresponse to neurotransmitters and intracellular messengers. Here, we examine this question for potassium channels, an extraordinarily diverse group of ion channels. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels control action-potential waveforms and neuronal firing patterns by opening and closing in response to membrane-potential changes. These effects can be strongly modulated by cytoplasmic factors such as kinases, phosphatases, and small GTPases. A Kv alpha subunit contains six transmembrane segments, including an intrinsic voltage sensor. In contrast, inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels have just two transmembrane segments in each of its four pore-lining alpha subunits. A variety of intracellular second messengers mediate transmitter and metabolic regulation of Kir channels. For example, Kir3 (GIRK) channels open on binding to the G protein betagamma subunits, thereby mediating slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in the brain. Our structure-based functional analysis on the cytoplasmic N-terminal tetramerization domain T1 of the voltage-gated channel, Kv1.2, uncovered a new function for this domain,\ninadequate resting activation of KV channels in rod and cone inner segments.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Mutations in a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit, KV8.2, underlie a blinding inherited photoreceptor dystrophy, indicating an important role for these channels in human vision. Here, we have defined the localization and subunit interactions of KV8.2 channels in primate photoreceptors. We show that the KV8.2 subunit interacts with different Kv2 channels in rods and cones, giving rise to potassium currents with distinct functional properties. Our results provide a molecular basis for retinal dysfunction in patients with mutations in the KCNV2 gene encoding KV8.2. Presynaptic development is controlled by the core active zone proteins CAST/ELKS. KEY POINTS: CAST/ELKS are positive regulators of presynaptic growth and are suppressors of active zone expansion at the developing mouse calyx of Held.

Kv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels consist of two types of \u03b1-subunits: (a) electrically-active Kcnb1 \u03b1-subunits and (b) silent or modulatory \u03b1-subunits plus \u03b2-subunits that, similar to silent \u03b1-subunits, also regulate electrically-active subunits. Voltage-gated potassium channels were traditionally viewed, mainly by electrophysiologists, as regulators of the electrical activity of the plasma membrane in excitable cells, a role that is performed by transmembrane protein domains of \u03b1-subunits that form the electric pore. Genetic studies revealed a role for this region of \u03b1-subunits of voltage-gated potassium channels in human neurodevelopmental disorders, such as epileptic encephalopathy. The N- and C-terminal domains of \u03b1-subunits interact to form the cytoplasmic subunit of heterotetrameric potassium channels that regulate electric pores.

Compendium of voltage-gated ion channels: potassium channels A mechanistic link between an inherited and an acquired cardiac arrhythmia: HERG encodes the IKr potassium channel Two components of cardiac delayed rectifier K+ current. Differential sensitivity to block by class III antiarrhythmic agents\nIn human retina, KV8.2 colocalized with KV2.1 and KV2.2 in cone inner segments and with KV2.1 in rod inner segments. KV2.1 and KV2.2 could be coimmunoprecipitated with KV8.2 in retinal lysates indicating that these subunits likely interact directly. Retinal KV2.1 was less phosphorylated than cortical KV2.1, a difference expected to alter the biophysical properties of these channels. Using voltage-clamp recordings and pharmacology, we provide functional evidence for Kv2-containing channels in primate rods and cones. We propose that the presence of KV8.2, and low levels of KV2.1 phosphorylation shift the activation range of KV2 channels to align with the operating range of rod and cone photoreceptors. Our data indicate a role for KV2/KV8.2 channels in human photoreceptor function and suggest that the visual deficits in patients with KCNV2 mutations arise from inadequate resting activation of KV channels in rod and cone inner segments.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Mutations in a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit,\na T65P trafficking deficient hERG mutant HERG potassium channel regulation by the N-terminal eag domain The structural mechanism of KCNH-channel regulation by the eag domain Fast inactivation causes rectification of the IKr channel Dynamic control of deactivation gating by a soluble amino-terminal domain in HERG K(+) channels Regulation of deactivation by an amino terminal domain in human ether-a-go-go-related gene potassium channels Direct interaction of eag domains and cyclic nucleotide-binding homology domains regulate deactivation gating in hERG channels Rescue of aberrant gating by a genetically encoded PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) domain in several long QT syndrome mutant human ether-a-go-go-related gene potassium channels A recombinant N-terminal domain fully restores deactivation gating in N-truncated and long QT syndrome mutant hERG potassium channels hERG potassium channel gating is mediated by N- and C-terminal region interactions The eag domain regulates hERG channel inactivation gating via a direct interaction hERG1a N-terminal eag domain-containing polypeptides regulate homomeric hERG1b and\nKCNE3 siRNA shifted the voltages for half-maximal activation to more hyperpolarized voltages, indicating that KCNE1 and KCNE3 may also inhibit activation gating of Kv12.2. Native co-immunoprecipitation assays from mouse brain membranes imply that KCNE1 and KCNE3 interact with Kv12.2 simultaneously in vivo, suggesting the existence of novel KCNE1-KCNE3-Kv12.2 channel tripartite complexes. Together these data indicate that KCNE1 and KCNE3 interact directly with Kv12.2 channels to regulate channel membrane trafficking. Structure and function of cardiac potassium channels. Recent advances in molecular biology have had a major impact on our understanding of the biophysical and molecular properties of ion channels. This review is focused on cardiac potassium channels which, in general, serve to control and limit cardiac excitability. Approximately 60 K+ channel subunits have been cloned to date. The (evolutionary) oldest potassium channel subunits consist of two transmembrane (Tm) segments with an intervening pore-loop (P). Channels formed by four 2Tm-1P subunits generally\nwere formed mediating voltage-activated delayed-rectifier type outward currents. Their kinetics and conductance-voltage relationship were different from those mediated by homomultimeric Kv2.1 channels. Yeast two-hybrid reporter assays indicated that Kv6.2 amino-termini are able to interact specifically with the Kv2.1 amino-terminus. It is proposed that this protein protein interaction underlies Kv2.1/Kv6.2 subunit assembly and the expression of functional heteromultimeric Kv2.1/Kv6.2 channels. The most resiliant feature of the Kv2.1/Kv6.2 channels was their submicromolar sensitivity to the antiarrhythmic drug propafenone. The data suggest that delayed-rectifier type channels containing Kv6.2 subunits may contribute to cardiac action potential repolarization. Controlling potassium channel activities: Interplay between the membrane and intracellular factors. Neural signaling is based on the regulated timing and extent of channel opening; therefore, it is important to understand how ion channels open and close in response to neurotransmitters and intracellular messengers. Here, we examine this question for potassium channels, an extraordinarily diverse group of ion\nligand switches from antagonist to agonist as a result of a rearrangement of the eag domain-CNBHD interaction during VDP. Regions responsible for the assembly of inwardly rectifying potassium channels. Inwardly rectifying potassium channels have an important role in determining the resting potential of the cell. They are tetrameric proteins with two transmembrane segments (M1 and M2), a pore-forming loop (H5), a cytoplasmic N-terminal, and longer C-terminal domain. We have used biochemical and electrophysiological methods to identify regions required for homotypic interactions and those responsible for the incompatibility between IRK1 and two other members of the same subfamily (IRK2 and IRK3) and two members from other subfamilies (ROMK1 and 6.1 uK(ATP)). The data indicate that, in contrast to the voltage-gated class of potassium channel, the proximal C-terminus and the transmembrane segment M2 determine homo-and heteromultimerization and that heteromultimerization between members of the same or different subfamilies is case specific.

Here, we show that ZK863.4/USIP-1 (U Six snRNA-Interacting Protein-1) is a ribonucleotidyl transferase that promotes accumulation of the Caenorhabditis elegans U6 snRNA. Endogenous USIP-1-U6 snRNA complexes lack the Lsm proteins that constitute the protein core of the U6 snRNP, but contain the U6 snRNP recycling factor SART3/B0035.12. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that SART3 but not USIP-1 occurs also in a separate complex containing both the U4 and U6 snRNPs. Based on this evidence, genetic interaction between usip-1 and sart-3, and the apparent dissociation of Lsm proteins from the U6 snRNA during spliceosome activation, we propose that USIP-1 functions upstream of SART3 to promote U6 snRNA recycling. Hierarchical, clustered protein interactions with U4/U6 snRNA: a biochemical role for U4/U6 proteins. During activation of the spliceosome, the U4/U6 snRNA duplex is dissociated, releasing U6 for subsequent base pairing with U2 snRNA. Proteins that directly bind the U4/U6\nrecombinant LSm2-8 proteins are able to recruit p110 protein to U6 snRNA via interaction with the highly conserved C-terminal region of p110. Furthermore, the presence of a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate enhances the affinity of U6 snRNA for the LSm2-8 proteins and inversely reduces La protein binding, suggesting a direct role of the 3'-terminal phosphorylation in RNP remodeling during U6 biogenesis. The ribonucleotidyl transferase USIP-1 acts with SART3 to promote U6 snRNA recycling. The spliceosome is a large molecular machine that serves to remove the intervening sequences that are present in most eukaryotic pre-mRNAs. At its core are five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes, the U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNPs, which undergo dynamic rearrangements during splicing. Their reutilization for subsequent rounds of splicing requires reversion to their original configurations, but little is known about this process. Here, we show that ZK863.4/USIP-1 (U Six snRNA-Interacting Protein-1) is a ribonucleotidyl transferase that promotes\ninvolved in processes other than pre-mRNA splicing. Human METTL16 is a N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase that targets pre-mRNAs and various non-coding RNAs. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a highly dynamic RNA modification that has recently emerged as a key regulator of gene expression. While many m6A modifications are installed by the METTL3-METTL14 complex, others appear to be introduced independently, implying that additional human m6A methyltransferases remain to be identified. Using crosslinking and analysis of cDNA (CRAC), we reveal that the putative human m6A \"writer\" protein METTL16 binds to the U6 snRNA and other ncRNAs as well as numerous lncRNAs and pre-mRNAs. We demonstrate that METTL16 is responsible for N6-methylation of A43 of the U6 snRNA and identify the early U6 biogenesis factors La, LARP7 and the methylphosphate capping enzyme MEPCE as METTL16 interaction partners. Interestingly, A43 lies within an essential ACAGAGA box of U6 that base pairs with 5' splice sites of pre-mRNAs\n3'\u21925' exoribonuclease that is responsible for removing 3'-terminal uridines from U6 snRNA transcripts, which leads to the formation of a 2',3' cyclic phosphate moiety (>P). This maturation step is fundamental for U6 snRNP assembly and recycling. Usb1 represents the first example of a direct association between a spliceosomal U6 snRNA biogenesis factor and human genetic disease. A Sm-like protein complex that participates in mRNA degradation. In eukaryotes, seven Sm proteins bind to the U1, U2, U4 and U5 spliceosomal snRNAs while seven Smlike proteins (Lsm2p-Lsm8p) are associated with U6 snRNA. Another yeast Sm-like protein, Lsm1p, does not interact with U6 snRNA. Surprisingly, using the tandem affinity purification (TAP) method, we identified Lsm1p among the subunits associated with Lsm3p. Coprecipitation experiments demonstrated that Lsm1p, together with Lsm2p-Lsm7p, forms a new seven-subunit complex. We purified the two related Sm-like protein complexes and identified the proteins recovered in the purified preparations by mass\nU4/U6 snRNA duplex is dissociated, releasing U6 for subsequent base pairing with U2 snRNA. Proteins that directly bind the U4/U6 interaction domain potentially could mediate these structural changes. We thus investigated binding of the human U4/U6-specific proteins, 15.5K, 61K and the 20/60/90K protein complex, to U4/U6 snRNA in vitro. We demonstrate that protein 15.5K is a nucleation factor for U4/U6 snRNP assembly, mediating the interaction of 61K and 20/60/90K with U4/U6 snRNA. A similar hierarchical assembly pathway is observed for the U4atac/U6atac snRNP. In addition, we show that protein 61K directly contacts the 5' portion of U4 snRNA via a novel RNA-binding domain. Furthermore, the 20/60/90K heteromer requires stem II but not stem I of the U4/U6 duplex for binding, and this interaction involves a direct contact between protein 90K and U6. This uneven clustering of the U4/U6 snRNP-specific proteins on U4/U6 snRNA is consistent with a sequential dissociation of\nrounds of splicing, although little is known about this process. Here we present evidence that regeneration of splicing activity in vitro is dependent on Lsm proteins. RNP reconstitution experiments with exogenous U6 RNA show that Lsm proteins promote the formation of U6-containing complexes and suggest that Lsm proteins have a chaperone-like function, supporting the assembly or remodeling of RNP complexes involved in splicing. Such a function could explain the involvement of Lsm proteins in a wide variety of RNA processing pathways. Multiple functional interactions between components of the Lsm2-Lsm8 complex, U6 snRNA, and the yeast La protein. The U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein is a critical component of the eukaryotic spliceosome. The first protein that binds the U6 snRNA is the La protein, an abundant phosphoprotein that binds the 3' end of many nascent small RNAs. A complex of seven Sm-like proteins, Lsm2-Lsm8, also binds the 3' end of U6 snRNA.\nfor growth. Our experiments are consistent with a model in which Lsm2p and Lsm4p contact Lsm8p in the Lsm2-Lsm8 ring and suggest that Lhp1p acts redundantly with the entire Lsm2-Lsm8 complex to stabilize nascent U6 snRNA. 3'-cyclic phosphorylation of U6 snRNA leads to recruitment of recycling factor p110 through LSm proteins. Pre-mRNA splicing proceeds through assembly of the spliceosome complex, catalysis, and recycling. During each cycle the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP is disrupted and U4/U6 snRNA base-pairing unwound, releasing separate post-spliceosomal U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs, which have to be recycled to the splicing-competent tri-snRNP. Previous work implicated p110--the human ortholog of the yeast Prp24 protein--and the LSm2-8 proteins of the U6 snRNP in U4/U6 recycling. Here we show in vitro that these proteins bind synergistically to U6 snRNA: Both purified and recombinant LSm2-8 proteins are able to recruit p110 protein to U6 snRNA via interaction with the highly conserved C-terminal region\nand U6. This uneven clustering of the U4/U6 snRNP-specific proteins on U4/U6 snRNA is consistent with a sequential dissociation of the U4/U6 duplex prior to spliceosome catalysis. A phylogenetic study of Drosophila splicing assembly chaperone RNP-4F associated U4-/U6-snRNA secondary structure. The rnp-4f gene in Drosophila melanogaster encodes nuclear protein RNP-4F. This encoded protein is represented by homologs in other eukaryotic species, where it has been shown to function as an intron splicing assembly factor. Here, RNP-4F is believed to initially bind to a recognition sequence on U6-snRNA, serving as a chaperone to facilitate its association with U4-snRNA by intermolecular hydrogen bonding. RNA conformations are a key factor in spliceosome function, so that elucidation of changing secondary structures for interacting snRNAs is a subject of considerable interest and importance. Among the five snRNAs which participate in removal of spliceosomal introns, there is a growing consensus that U6-snRNA is the most structurally\nof many nascent small RNAs. A complex of seven Sm-like proteins, Lsm2-Lsm8, also binds the 3' end of U6 snRNA. A mutation within the Sm motif of Lsm8p causes Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells to require the La protein Lhp1p to stabilize nascent U6 snRNA. Here we describe functional interactions between Lhp1p, the Lsm proteins, and U6 snRNA. LSM2 and LSM4, but not other LSM genes, act as allele-specific, low-copy suppressors of mutations in Lsm8p. Overexpression of LSM2 in the lsm8 mutant strain increases the levels of both Lsm8p and U6 snRNPs. In the presence of extra U6 snRNA genes, LSM8 becomes dispensable for growth, suggesting that the only essential function of LSM8 is in U6 RNA biogenesis or function. Furthermore, deletions of LSM5, LSM6, or LSM7 cause LHP1 to become required for growth. Our experiments are consistent with a model in which Lsm2p and Lsm4p contact Lsm8p in the Lsm2-Lsm8 ring\npartners. Interestingly, A43 lies within an essential ACAGAGA box of U6 that base pairs with 5' splice sites of pre-mRNAs during splicing, suggesting that METTL16-mediated modification of this site plays an important role in splicing regulation. The identification of METTL16 as an active m6A methyltransferase in human cells expands our understanding of the mechanisms by which the m6A landscape is installed on cellular RNAs. U6 RNA biogenesis and disease association. U6 snRNA is one of five uridine-rich noncoding RNAs that form the major spliceosome complex. Unlike other U-snRNAs, it reveals many distinctive aspects of biogenesis such as transcription by RNA polymerase III, transcript nuclear retention and particular features of transcript ends: monomethylated 5'-guanosine triphosphate as cap structure and a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate moiety (>P) at the 3' termini. U6-snRNA plays a central role in splicing and thus its transcription, maturation, snRNP formation, and recycling are essential for cellular homeostasis. U6 snRNA\nLsm proteins promote regeneration of pre-mRNA splicing activity. Lsm proteins are ubiquitous, multifunctional proteins that affect the processing of most RNAs in eukaryotic cells, but their function is unknown. A complex of seven Lsm proteins, Lsm2-8, associates with the U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) that is a component of spliceosome complexes in which pre-mRNA splicing occurs. Spliceosomes contain five snRNAs, U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6, that are packaged as ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs). U4 and U6 snRNAs contain extensive sequence complementarity and interact to form U4/U6 di-snRNPs. U4/U6 di-snRNPs associate with U5 snRNPs to form U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNPs prior to spliceosome assembly. Within spliceosomes, disruption of base-paired U4/U6 heterodimer allows U6 snRNA to form part of the catalytic center. Following completion of the splicing reaction, snRNPs must be recycled for subsequent rounds of splicing, although little is known about this process. Here we present evidence that regeneration of splicing activity in\ncentral role in splicing and thus its transcription, maturation, snRNP formation, and recycling are essential for cellular homeostasis. U6 snRNA enters the splicing cycle as part of the tri-U4/U6.U5snRNP complex, and after significant structural arrangements forms the catalytic site of the spliceosome together with U2 snRNA and Prp8. U6 snRNA also contributes to the splicing reaction by coordinating metal cations required for catalysis. Many human diseases are associated with altered splicing processes. Disruptions of the basal splicing machinery can be lethal or lead to severe diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or retinitis pigmentosa. Recent studies have identified a new U6 snRNA biogenesis factor Usb1, the absence of which leads to poikiloderma with neutropenia (PN) (OMIM 604173), an autosomal recessive skin disease. Usb1 is an evolutionarily conserved 3'\u21925' exoribonuclease that is responsible for removing 3'-terminal uridines from U6 snRNA transcripts, which leads to the formation of a\ndescribe a novel set of Sm-like (Lsm) proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that interact with each other and with U6 snRNA. Seven Lsm proteins co-immunoprecipitate with the previously characterized Lsm4p (Uss1p) and interact with each other in two-hybrid analyses. Free U6 and U4/U6 duplexed RNAs co-immunoprecipitate with seven of the Lsm proteins that are essential for the stable accumulation of U6 snRNA. Analyses of U4/U6 di-snRNPs and U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNPs in Lsm-depleted strains suggest that Lsm proteins may play a role in facilitating conformational rearrangements of the U6 snRNP in the association-dissociation cycle of spliceosome complexes. Thus, Lsm proteins form a complex that differs from the canonical Sm complex in its RNA association(s) and function. We discuss the possible existence and functions of alternative Lsm complexes, including the likelihood that they are involved in processes other than pre-mRNA splicing. Human METTL16 is a N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase that targets pre-mRNAs and various non-coding\nfive snRNAs which participate in removal of spliceosomal introns, there is a growing consensus that U6-snRNA is the most structurally dynamic and may constitute the catalytic core. Previous studies by others have generated potential secondary structures for free U4- and U6-snRNAs, including the Y-shaped U4-/U6-snRNA model. These models were based on study of RNAs from relatively few species, and the popular Y-shaped model remains to be systematically re-examined with reference to the many new sequences generated by recent genomic sequencing projects. We have utilized a comparative phylogenetic approach on 60 diverse eukaryotic species, which resulted in a revised and improved U4-/U6-snRNA secondary structure. This general model is supported by observation of abundant compensatory base mutations in every stem, and incorporates more of the nucleotides into base-paired associations than in previous models, thus being more energetically stable. We have extensively sampled the eukaryotic phylogenetic tree to its deepest roots, but did\nmodels, thus being more energetically stable. We have extensively sampled the eukaryotic phylogenetic tree to its deepest roots, but did not find genes potentially encoding either U4- or U6-snRNA in the Giardia and Trichomonas data-bases. Our results support the hypothesis that nuclear introns in these most deeply rooted eukaryotes may represent evolutionary intermediates, sharing characteristics of both group II and spliceosomal introns. An unexpected result of this study was discovery of a potential competitive binding site for Drosophila splicing assembly factor RNP-4F to a 5'-UTR regulatory region within its own premRNA, which may play a role in negative feedback control. Characterization of Sm-like proteins in yeast and their association with U6 snRNA. Seven Sm proteins associate with U1, U2, U4 and U5 spliceosomal snRNAs and influence snRNP biogenesis. Here we describe a novel set of Sm-like (Lsm) proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that interact with each other and with U6 snRNA.\ncomplex. We purified the two related Sm-like protein complexes and identified the proteins recovered in the purified preparations by mass spectrometry. This confirmed the association of the Lsm2p-Lsm8p complex with U6 snRNA. In contrast, the Lsm1p-Lsm7p complex is associated with Pat1p and Xrn1p exoribonuclease, suggesting a role in mRNA degradation. Deletions of LSM1, 6, 7 and PAT1 genes increased the half-life of reporter mRNAs. Interestingly, accumulating mRNAs were capped, suggesting a block in mRNA decay at the decapping step. These results indicate the involvement of a new conserved Sm-like protein complex and a new factor, Pat1p, in mRNA degradation and suggest a physical connection between decapping and exonuclease trimming.",

The ability of dopamine receptors to interact with other receptor subtypes may provide mechanisms for modulating dopamine-related functions and behaviors. In particular, there is evidence suggesting that the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) affects the dopaminergic system by regulating the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons or by altering dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) responsiveness to ligands. TAAR1 is a G\u03b1(s) protein-coupled receptor that is activated by biogenic amines, \"trace amines,\" such as \u03b2-phenylethylamine (\u03b2-PEA) and tyramine that are normally found at low concentrations in the mammalian brain. In the present study, we investigated the biochemical mechanism of interaction between TAAR1 and D2R and the role this interaction plays in D2R-related signaling and behaviors. Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer biosensor for cAMP, we demonstrated that the D2R antagonists haloperidol, raclopride, and amisulpride were able to enhance selectively a TAAR1-mediated \u03b2-PEA\nspecies-specific differences between human and mouse TAAR1. Our study provides insights into the mechanism of ligand recognition and G-protein selectivity by TAAR1, which may help in the discovery of ligands or therapeutic strategies for neurological and metabolic disorders. Trace Amines and the Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1: Pharmacology, Neurochemistry, and Clinical Implications. Biogenic amines are a collection of endogenous molecules that play pivotal roles as neurotransmitters and hormones. In addition to the \"classical\" biogenic amines resulting from decarboxylation of aromatic acids, including dopamine (DA), norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin (5-HT), and histamine, other biogenic amines, present at much lower concentrations in the central nervous system (CNS), and hence referred to as \"trace\" amines (TAs), are now recognized to play significant neurophysiological and behavioral functions. At the turn of the century, the discovery of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a phylogenetically conserved G protein-coupled receptor that is responsive to both TAs, such as\ndysregulation, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, mood disorders, and addiction. Indeed, the recent development of novel pharmacological tools targeting TAAR1 has uncovered the remarkable potential of TAAR1-based medications as new generation pharmacotherapies in neuropsychiatry. This review summarizes recent developments in the study of TAs and TAAR1, their intricate neurochemistry and pharmacology, and their relevance for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease. Recognition of methamphetamine and other amines by trace amine receptor TAAR1. Trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), the founding member of a nine-member family of trace amine receptors, is responsible for recognizing a range of biogenic amines in the brain, including the endogenous \u03b2-phenylethylamine (\u03b2-PEA)1 as well as methamphetamine2, an abused substance that has posed a severe threat to human health and society3. Given its unique physiological role in the brain, TAAR1 is also an emerging target for a range of neurological disorders including schizophrenia, depression and drug addiction2,4,5. Here we report structures\nfor cAMP, we demonstrated that the D2R antagonists haloperidol, raclopride, and amisulpride were able to enhance selectively a TAAR1-mediated \u03b2-PEA increase of cAMP. Moreover, TAAR1 and D2R were able to form heterodimers when coexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and this direct interaction was disrupted in the presence of haloperidol. In addition, in mice lacking TAAR1, haloperidol-induced striatal c-Fos expression and catalepsy were significantly reduced. Taken together, these data suggest that TAAR1 and D2R have functional and physical interactions that could be critical for the modulation of the dopaminergic system by TAAR1 in vivo. Ligand recognition and G-protein coupling of trace amine receptor TAAR1. Trace-amine-associated receptors (TAARs), a group of biogenic amine receptors, have essential roles in neurological and metabolic homeostasis1. They recognize diverse endogenous trace amines and subsequently activate a range of G-protein-subtype signalling pathways2,3. Notably, TAAR1 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for treating psychiatric disorders4,5.\nthe trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a phylogenetically conserved G protein-coupled receptor that is responsive to both TAs, such as \u03b2-phenylethylamine, octopamine, and tyramine, and structurally-related amphetamines, unveiled mechanisms of action for TAs other than interference with aminergic pathways, laying the foundations for deciphering the functional significance of TAs and its mammalian CNS receptor, TAAR1. Although, its molecular interactions and downstream targets have not been fully elucidated, TAAR1 activation triggers accumulation of intracellular cAMP, modulates PKA and PKC signaling and interferes with the \u03b2-arrestin2-dependent pathway via G protein-independent mechanisms. TAAR1 is uniquely positioned to exert direct control over DA and 5-HT neuronal firing and release, which has profound implications for understanding the pathophysiology of, and therefore designing more efficacious therapeutic interventions for, a range of neuropsychiatric disorders that involve aminergic dysregulation, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, mood disorders, and addiction. Indeed, the recent development of novel pharmacological tools targeting TAAR1 has\nactivate a range of G-protein-subtype signalling pathways2,3. Notably, TAAR1 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for treating psychiatric disorders4,5. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its ability to recognize different ligands remain largely unclear. Here we present nine cryo-electron microscopy structures, with eight showing human and mouse TAAR1 in a complex with an array of ligands, including the endogenous 3-iodothyronamine, two antipsychotic agents, the psychoactive drug amphetamine and two identified catecholamine agonists, and one showing 5-HT1AR in a complex with an antipsychotic agent. These structures reveal a rigid consensus binding motif in TAAR1 that binds to endogenous trace amine stimuli and two extended binding pockets that accommodate diverse chemotypes. Combined with mutational analysis, functional assays and molecular dynamic simulations, we elucidate the structural basis of drug polypharmacology and identify the species-specific differences between human and mouse TAAR1. Our study provides insights into the mechanism of ligand recognition and G-protein selectivity\nalso an emerging target for a range of neurological disorders including schizophrenia, depression and drug addiction2,4,5. Here we report structures of human TAAR1-G-protein complexes bound to methamphetamine and \u03b2-PEA as well as complexes bound to RO5256390, a TAAR1-selective agonist, and SEP-363856, a clinical-stage dual agonist for TAAR1 and serotonin receptor 5-HT1AR (refs. 6,7). Together with systematic mutagenesis and functional studies, the structures reveal the molecular basis of methamphetamine recognition and underlying mechanisms of ligand selectivity and polypharmacology between TAAR1 and other monoamine receptors. We identify a lid-like extracellular loop 2 helix/loop structure and a hydrogen-bonding network in the ligand-binding pockets, which may contribute to the ligand recognition in TAAR1. These findings shed light on the ligand recognition mode and activation mechanism for TAAR1 and should guide the development of next-generation therapeutics for drug addiction and various neurological disorders.",

To address this question, we used a combination of techniques: cell-attached electrophysiology on GnRH-driven green fluorescent protein-tagged neurons in acute brain slices; calcium imaging on cultured GnRH neurons; and immunostaining on adult brain tissue. We found (1) NPFF inhibits GnRH neuron excitability via the RFRP receptor and its canonical signaling pathway (Gi/o protein and G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels), (2) NPFF-like fibers in the vicinity of GnRH neurons coexpress neuropeptide Y, (3) the majority of NPFF-like cell bodies in the NTS also coexpress neuropeptide Y, and (4)\nRFamide-related Peptide 3 Signaling via Neuropeptide FF Receptor Stimulates Prolactin Secretion in Female Rats.

Sarma. Structure-activity studies of RFamide-related peptide-1 identify a functional receptor antagonist and novel cardiac myocyte signaling pathway involved in contractile performance. Human RFamide-related peptide-1 (hRFRP-1, MPHSFANLPLRF-NH(2)) binds to neuropeptide FF receptor 2 (NPFF(2)R) to dramatically diminish cardiovascular performance. hRFRP-1 and its signaling pathway may provide targets to address cardiac dysfunction. Here, structure-activity relationship, transcript, Ca(2+) transient, and phospholabeling data indicate the presence of a hRFRP-1 pathway in cardiomyocytes. Alanyl-substituted and N-terminal truncated analogues identified that R(11) was essential for activity, hRFRP-1((8-12)) mimicked hRFRP-1, and [A(11)]hRFRP-1((8-12)) antagonized the effect of hRFRP-1 in cellular and integrated cardiac performance. RFRP and NPFF(2)R transcripts were amplified from cardiomyocytes and heart. Maintenance of the Ca(2+) transient when hRFRP-1 impaired myocyte shortening indicated the myofilament was its primary downstream target.

Structural Perspective on Ancient Neuropeptide Y-like System reveals Hallmark Features for Peptide Recognition and Receptor Activation. The neuropeptide Y (NPY) family is a peptide-activated G protein-coupled receptor system conserved across all bilaterians, and is involved in food intake, learning, and behavior. We hypothesized that comparing the NPY system in evolutionarily ancient organisms can reveal structural determinants of peptide recognition and receptor activation conserved in evolution. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the homologous FLP/NPR system of the protostome C.elegans. For three prototypic peptide-receptor complexes representing different ligand types, we integrate extensive functional data into structural models of the receptors. Common features include acidic patches in the extracellular loops (ECLs) of the receptors that cooperatively 'draw' the peptide into the binding pocket, which was functionally validated in vivo. A structurally conserved glutamate in the ECL2 anchors the peptides by\nnew therapeutic option for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism? Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (secondary hypogonadism), congenital or acquired, is a form of hypogonadism that is due to problems with either the hypothalamus or pituitary gland affecting gonadotropin levels. Pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by hypothalamus is a primer step to initiate the release of pituitary gonadotropins. Kisspeptin and gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) are accepted as two major players in the activation and inhibition of GnRH regarding the neuroendocrine functioning of the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis. Kisspeptin is known as the most potent activator of GnRH. Regarding the inhibition of GnRH, RF-amide-related peptide-3 (RFRP-3) is accepted as the mammalian orthologue of GnIH in avian species. RF9 (1-adamantane carbonyl-Arg-Phe-NH2) is an antagonist of RFRP-3/GnIH receptor (neuropeptide FF receptor 1 (NPFFR1; also termed as GPR147). In recent years, several studies have indicated that RF9 activates GnRH neurons and gonadotropins in a kisspeptin receptor (Kiss1r, formerly known as GPR54)\nimpaired myocyte shortening indicated the myofilament was its primary downstream target. Enhanced myofilament protein phosphorylation detected after hRFRP-1 treatment but absent in [A(11)]hRFRP-1((8-12))-treated cells was consistent with this result. Protein kinase C (PKC) but not PKA inhibitor diminished the influence of hRFRP-1 on the Ca(2+) transient. Molecules targeting this pathway may help address cardiovascular disease. An Inhibitory Circuit From Brainstem to GnRH Neurons in Male Mice: A New Role for the RFRP Receptor. RFamide-related peptides (RFRPs, mammalian orthologs of gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone) convey circadian, seasonal, and social cues to the reproductive system. They regulate gonadotropin secretion by modulating gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons via the RFRP receptor. Mice lacking this receptor are fertile but exhibit abnormal gonadotropin responses during metabolic challenges, such as acute fasting, when the normal drop in gonadotropin levels is delayed. Although it is known that these food intake signals to the reproductive circuit originate in the nucleus tractus\nthe binding pocket, which was functionally validated in vivo. A structurally conserved glutamate in the ECL2 anchors the peptides by a conserved salt bridge to the arginine of the RFamide motif. Beyond this conserved interaction, peptide binding show variability enabled by receptor-specific interactions. The family-conserved residue Q3.32 is a key player for peptide binding and receptor activation. Altered interaction patterns at Q3.32 may drastically increase the efficacy to activate the receptor. Functional study of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) in keratinocytes: microarray integrating bioinformatics approaches. The function of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) has been gradually elucidated in several diseases, especially in various cancers. However, the role of ALDH1 in skin-related diseases has been mostly unknown. Previously, we found that ALDH1 is involved in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD). In this study, we used high-throughput screening (HTS) approaches to identify critical factors associated with ALDH1 in human keratinocytes to reveal its\nprotein has provided more insight into its dynamic behavior. The expression of GnIH and its receptors, shows an inverse correlation with gonadal development during the annual reproductive cycle. Chronic activation of NPFFR2 stimulates the stress-related depressive behaviors through HPA axis modulation. Neuropeptide FF (NPFF) is a morphine-modulating peptide that regulates the analgesic effect of opioids, and also controls food consumption and cardiovascular function through its interaction with two cognate receptors, NPFFR1 and NPFFR2. In the present study, we explore a novel modulatory role for NPFF-NPFFR2 in stress-related depressive behaviors. In a mouse model of chronic mild stress (CMS)-induced depression, the expression of NPFF significantly increased in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and amygdala. In addition, transgenic (Tg) mice over-expressing NPFFR2 displayed clear depression and anxiety-like behaviors with hyperactivity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, reduced expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Furthermore, acute treatment of\ntogether, our study demonstrates that RF9 acts primarily as a KISS1R agonist, but not as an allosteric modulator, to stimulate LH secretion. Our findings raise questions regarding the utility of RF9 for assessing NPFF1R function and de-emphasize a predominant role of this signaling system in central regulation of reproduction. Neuropeptide AF Induces Piecemeal Degranulation in Murine Mucosal Mast Cells: A New Mediator in Neuro-Immune Communication in the Intestinal Lamina Propria? Neuropeptides AF (NPAF), FF (NPFF) and SF (NPSF) are RFamide neuropeptides known to be widely expressed in the mammalian central nervous system, where they fulfill a wide range of functions with pain modulation being the most prominent one. Recent evidence indicates that RFamides act as mediators in mast cell-sensory nerve communications related to allergic disease. Previous work by our group has shown that the expression levels of some members of the Mas-related gene receptor (Mrgpr) family in both enteric neurons\nhas shown that the expression levels of some members of the Mas-related gene receptor (Mrgpr) family in both enteric neurons and mucosal mast cells change during intestinal inflammation. The Mrgpr subtypes C11 and A4 can be activated by NPAF, while A1 and C11 are triggered by NPFF. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether RFamides of the NPFF group are expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and to identify possible targets and receptors that might be involved in RFamide-associated mast cell modulation. To this end, the expression and distribution patterns of NPFF/AF receptors and the NPFF precursor protein were determined in bone marrow-derived mucosal mast cells (BMMCs) by immunocytochemistry and (RT-) PCR. BMMCs were found to express MrgprA4 and A1, and functional analysis of the effects of NPAF by means of a \u03b2-hexosaminidase assay, mMCP-1 ELISA, electron microscopy and live cell calcium imaging revealed a piecemeal degranulation induced\nneurons coexpress neuropeptide Y, (3) the majority of NPFF-like cell bodies in the NTS also coexpress neuropeptide Y, and (4) acute fasting increased NPFF-like immunoreactivity in the NTS. Together these data indicate that NPFF neurons within the NTS inhibit GnRH neurons, and thus reproduction, during fasting but prior to the energy deficit. RF9 Acts as a KISS1R Agonist In Vivo and In Vitro. RF9, a reported antagonist of the mammalian gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone receptor, stimulates gonadotropin secretion in mammals. Recent studies have suggested that the stimulatory effect of RF9 on gonadotropin secretion relies on intact kisspeptin receptor (KISS1R) signaling, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Using Chinese Hamster Ovary cells stably transfected with KISS1R, we show that RF9 binds specifically to KISS1R, with a Kd of 1.6 \u00d7 10(-5)M, and stimulates an increase in intracellular calcium and inositol phosphate accumulation in a KISS1R-dependent manner, with EC50 values of 3.0\nkisspeptin may result in desensitization of the gonadotropic axis. The reasons reported above contribute to our hypothesis that RF9 may be a good option in the GnRH stimulating as a kisspeptin agonist. We suggest that further studies are needed to elucidate the potential effects of RF9 in the treatment of the hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Molecular cloning and bioinformatic characterization of Gonadotropin Inhibitory Hormone (GnIH) and its receptors in the freshwater murrel, Channa punctatus (Bloch, 1793). Gonadotropin inhibitory hormone belonging to the RFamide peptide family, a hypothalamic neuropeptide, regulates Hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and inhibits gonadal development. GnIH polypeptide precursor has an Arg-Phe-NH2 (RFamide) motif at the C-terminal, which has LPXRF (X = Q or L) domain. The actions of GnIH are mediated through G-protein coupled receptors and upto three receptors have been characterized in many teleosts. GnIH exerts its inhibitory effect on the HPG axis through direct interaction with GnRH and Kisspeptin\nby means of a \u03b2-hexosaminidase assay, mMCP-1 ELISA, electron microscopy and live cell calcium imaging revealed a piecemeal degranulation induced by NPAF. However, knock-out of MrgprA4 and A1 did not reduce the effect of NPAF, indicating that the BMMC response to NPAF was receptor independent. ProNPFF was expressed in neurons and BMMCs, suggesting that both cell types are potential sources of NPAF in situ. Our results show that the RFamide NPAF can be considered as a novel modulator of BMMC activity in the neuro-immune communication in the gastrointestinal tract, although the exact signaling pathway remains to be elucidated. Anat Rec, 00:000-000, 2018. \u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Anat Rec, 301:1103-1114, 2018. \u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\nseveral studies have indicated that RF9 activates GnRH neurons and gonadotropins in a kisspeptin receptor (Kiss1r, formerly known as GPR54) dependent manner. These results suggest that RF9 may have a bimodal function as both an RFRP-3 antagonist and a kisspeptin agonist or it may be a kiss1r agonist rather than an RFRP-3/GnIH receptor antagonist. These interactions are possible because Kisspeptin and GnIH are members of the RF-amide family, and both possibilities are not far from explaining the potent gonadotropin stimulating effects of RF9. Therefore, we hypothesize that RF9 may be a new therapeutic option for the hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to its potent GnRH stimulating effects. A constant or repeated administration of RF9 provides a sustained increase in plasma gonadotrophin levels. However, applications in the same way with GnRH analogues and kisspeptin may result in desensitization of the gonadotropic axis. The reasons reported above contribute to our hypothesis that RF9 may\nin the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, reduced expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Furthermore, acute treatment of NPFFR2 agonists in wild-type (WT) mice enhanced the activity of the HPA axis, and chronic administration resulted in depressive and anxiety-like behaviors. Chronic stimulation of NPFFR2 also decreased the expression of hippocampal GR and led to persistent activation of the HPA axis. Strikingly, bilateral intra-paraventricular nucleus (PVN) injection of NPFFR2 shRNA predominately inhibits the depressive-like behavior in CMS-exposed mice. Antidepressants, fluoxetine and ketamine, effectively relieved the depressive behaviors of NPFFR2-Tg mice. We speculate that persistent NPFFR2 activation, in particular in the hypothalamus, up-regulates the HPA axis and results in long-lasting increases in circulating corticosterone (CORT), consequently damaging hippocampal function. This novel role of NPFFR2 in regulating the HPA axis and hippocampal function provides a new avenue for combating depression and anxiety-like disorder. Structural Perspective on Ancient Neuropeptide Y-like System reveals\ncharacterized in many teleosts. GnIH exerts its inhibitory effect on the HPG axis through direct interaction with GnRH and Kisspeptin neurons in the brain and acts directly on the pituitary gonadotrophs. To decipher the role of GnIH in Indian freshwater murrel, Channa punctatus, we sequenced the cDNA encoding GnIH and its two receptors. The identified GnIH mRNA encodes three RFamide peptides having -MPMRF, -MPQRF, and -LPQRFamide motifs. In silico analysis of the amino acid sequence of GnIH exhibits its molecular and functional properties and the protein-protein interaction with significant factors regulating the HPG axis. The 3-D structure of GnIH and its receptors, provides more relevant information about the active residues of these proteins which might be involved in their functioning and interaction with other proteins. Molecular dynamic simulation of GnIH protein has provided more insight into its dynamic behavior. The expression of GnIH and its receptors, shows an inverse correlation\nand stimulates an increase in intracellular calcium and inositol phosphate accumulation in a KISS1R-dependent manner, with EC50 values of 3.0 \u00d7 10(-6)M and 1.6 \u00d7 10(-7)M, respectively. RF9 also stimulated ERK phosphorylation, with a time course similar to that of kisspeptin-10. RFRP-3, the putative endogenous ligand for NPFFR1, did not stimulate inositol phosphate accumulation or pERK, nor did it alter responses to of kisspeptin-10 or RF9. In agreement with these in vitro data, we found that RF9 stimulated a robust LH increase in Npffr1(-/-) mice, similar to that in wild-type littermates, whereas the stimulatory effect of RF9 was markedly reduced in Kiss1r(-/-) and double Kiss1r(-/-)/Npfrr1(-/-) mice. The stimulatory effect of RF9 on LH secretion was restored by the selective rescue of Kiss1r expression in GnRH neurons, in Kiss1r(-/-T) mice. Taken together, our study demonstrates that RF9 acts primarily as a KISS1R agonist, but not as an allosteric modulator, to stimulate\nsecretion, which was associated with a rise in the dopaminergic activity in the median eminence, but had no effect on LH levels. The RFRP-3-induced increase in PRL secretion was prevented by GJ14. Moreover, the estradiol-induced PRL surge in female rats was blunted by GJ14, along with an amplification of the LH surge. Nevertheless, whole-cell patch clamp recordings showed no effect of RFRP-3 on the electrical activity of TIDA neurons in dopamine transporter-Cre recombinase transgenic female mice. We provide evidence that RFRP-3 binds to Npffr1 to stimulate PRL release, which plays a role in the estradiol-induced PRL surge. This effect of RFRP-3 is apparently not mediated by a reduction in the inhibitory tone of TIDA neurons but possibly involves the activation of a hypothalamic PRL-releasing factor. RF9: May it be a new therapeutic option for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism? Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (secondary hypogonadism), congenital or acquired, is a form of hypogonadism that is\nstudy, we used high-throughput screening (HTS) approaches to identify critical factors associated with ALDH1 in human keratinocytes to reveal its functions in skin. We overexpressed ALDH1 in human HaCaT keratinocytes and then conducted serial HTS studies, a DNA microarray and antibody array integrated with bioinformatics algorithms. Together, those tests identified several novel genes associated with the function of ALDH1 in keratinocytes, as well as AD, including CTSG and CCL11. In particular, GNB3, GHSR, TAS2R9, FFAR1, TAS2R16, CCL21, GPR32, NPFFR1, GPR15, FBXW12, CCL19, EDNRA, FFAR3, and RXFP3 proteins were consistently detected as hub proteins in the PPI maps. By integrating the datasets obtained from these HTS studies and using the strengths of each method, we obtained new insights into the functional role of ALDH1 in skin keratinocytes. The approach used here could contribute to the clinical understanding of ALDH1-associated applications for the treatment of AD.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma. Structure-activity studies",

By contrast, the EXS domain was associated with a slightly smaller protein complex than the native protein complex, but it largely displaced endogenous SHB1 from its native protein complex. In addition, all six missense mutations that we identified from a suppressor screen were clustered within or close to the SPX domain, and these mutations impaired the assembly of the SHB1-containing protein complex. We propose that both SPX and EXS domains likely anchor SHB1 to a protein complex, and the SPX domain is critical for SHB1 signaling. SlSPX1-SlPHR complexes mediate the suppression of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis by phosphate repletion in tomato. Forming mutualistic symbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizae (AMs) improves the acquisition of mineral nutrients for most terrestrial plants. However, the formation of AM symbiosis usually occurs under phosphate (Pi)-deficient conditions.

A null allele of the G alpha (GPA1/SCG1) subunit results in cell death due to unchecked signaling from the G beta gamma (STE4, STE18, respectively) heterodimer. We have identified three high copy suppressors of gpa1 lethality. Two of these genes encode known transcription factors. Mat alpha 2p and Mcm1p. The third is a truncated form of a novel gene, SYG1. Overexpressed wild type SYG1 is a weak suppressor of gpa1. In contrast, the isolated mutant allele SYG1-1 is a strong suppressor that completely blocks the cell cycle arrest and differentiation phenotypes of gpa1 cells of both mating types. One deletion mutant (SYG1 delta 340) can suppress the cell cycle arrest associated with gpa1, but the cells retain a differentiated morphology. SYG1-1 can suppress the effects of overexpressed wild type G beta but\nanimals. In addition, PP-InsPs can potentially interact with several major signaling proteins in plants, suggesting PP-InsPs play unique signaling roles via binding to protein partners. In this review, we will compare the biosynthesis and role of PP-InsPs in animals and plants, focusing on three central themes: InsP6 synthesis pathways, synthesis and regulation of the PP-InsPs, and function of a specific protein domain called the Syg1, Pho1, Xpr1 (SPX ) domain in binding PP-InsPs and regulating inorganic phosphate (Pi) sensing. This review will provide novel insights into the biosynthetic pathway and bioactivity of these key signaling molecules in plant and human systems. Truncated forms of a novel yeast protein suppress the lethality of a G protein alpha subunit deficiency by interacting with the beta subunit.

A null\ngpa1, but the cells retain a differentiated morphology. SYG1-1 can suppress the effects of overexpressed wild type G beta but is not able to suppress the lethality of an activated G beta mutant (STE4Hpl). Consistent with these genetic observations, the suppressing form of Syg1p can interact with the STE4 gene product, as determined by a two-hybrid assay. SYG1-1 is also capable of promoting pheromone recovery in wild type cells, as judged by halo assay. The sequence of SYG1 predicts eight membrane-spanning domains. Deletion mutants of SYG1 indicate that complete gpa1 suppression requires removal of all of these hydrophobic regions. Interestingly, this truncated protein localizes to the same plasma membrane-enriched subcellular fraction as does full-length Syg1p. Three hypothetical yeast proteins, identified by their similarity to the SYG1 primary sequence within the gpa1 suppression domain, also appear to have related structures. The properties of Syg1p are consistent with those of a transmembrane\ntruncations and mutations alter its association with a signaling protein complex in Arabidopsis. Higher plants monitor their ambient light signals through red/far-red absorbing phytochromes and blue/UV-A light absorbing cryptochromes. Subsequent signaling cascades alter gene expression and initiate morphogenic responses. We previously isolated SHORT HYPOCOTYL UNDER BLUE1 (SHB1), a putative transcriptional coactivator in light signaling. SHB1 is homologous to the SYG1 protein family and contains an N-terminal SPX domain and a C-terminal EXS domain. Overaccumulation of the SPX domain caused a long hypocotyl phenotype similar to that of shb1-D under red, far-red, or blue light. By contrast, overaccumulation of the C-terminal EXS domain led to a short hypocotyl phenotype similar to that of shb1 under blue light. The N-terminal SPX domain was associated with a smaller protein complex than the native protein complex associated with endogenous SHB1. By contrast, the EXS domain was associated with a slightly smaller protein complex than\nAtSPX1 affects the AtPHR1-DNA-binding equilibrium by binding monomeric AtPHR1 in solution. Phosphorus is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and is deficient in \u223c50% of agricultural soils. The transcription factor phosphate starvation response 1 (PHR1) plays a central role in regulating the expression of a subset of phosphate starvation-induced (PSI) genes through binding to a cis-acting DNA element termed P1BS (PHR1-binding sequences). In Arabidopsis and rice, activity of AtPHR1/OsPHR2 is regulated in part by their downstream target SPX (Syg1, Pho81, Xpr1) proteins through protein-protein interaction. Here, we provide kinetic and affinity data for interaction between AtPHR1 and P1BS sites. Using surface plasmon resonance, a tandem P1BS sequence showed \u223c50-fold higher affinity for MBPAtdPHR1 (a fusion protein comprising the DNA-binding domain and coiled-coil domain of AtPHR1 fused to maltose-binding protein) than a single site. The affinity difference was largely reflected in a much slower dissociation rate from the 2\u00d7 P1BS-binding site,\ninformation about its functional context. Whereas homology-based methods predict the molecular function of a protein, genomic context methods predict the biological process in which it plays a role. These complementary approaches can be combined to elucidate complete functional networks and biochemical pathways from the genome sequence of an organism. Here we review recent advances in the field of genomic-context based methods of protein function prediction. Techniques are highlighted with examples, including an analysis that combines information from genomic-context with homology to predict a role of the RNase L inhibitor in the maturation of ribosomal RNA. SPX4 Acts on PHR1-Dependent and -Independent Regulation of Shoot Phosphorus Status in Arabidopsis. Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient for all living organisms and limits plant growth. Four proteins comprising a single SYG1/Pho81/XPR1 (SPX) domain, SPX1 to SPX4, are putative phosphate-dependent inhibitors of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1 (PHR1), the master transcriptional activator of\nsites of homologous proteins in more than one way. Understanding the mechanisms of protein-protein interaction is a fundamental problem with many practical applications. The fact that different proteins can bind similar partners suggests that convergently evolved binding interfaces are reused in different complexes. A set of protein complexes composed of non-homologous domains interacting with homologous partners at equivalent binding sites was collected in 2006, offering an opportunity to investigate this point. We considered 433 pairs of protein-protein complexes from the ABAC database (AB and AC binary protein complexes sharing a homologous partner A) and analyzed the extent of physico-chemical similarity at the atomic and residue level at the protein-protein interface. Homologous partners of the complexes were superimposed using Multiprot, and similar atoms at the interface were quantified using a five class grouping scheme and a distance cut-off. We found that the number of interfacial atoms with similar properties is systematically\nHPH2. Furthermore, BMI1 does not interact with the individual homology domains. Instead, both intact homology domains I and II need to be present for interactions with BMI1. These data demonstrate the involvement of homology domains I and II in protein-protein interactions and indicate that HPH1 and HPH2 are able to heterodimerize. Prediction of protein function and pathways in the genome era. The growing number of completely sequenced genomes adds new dimensions to the use of sequence analysis to predict protein function. Compared with the classical knowledge transfer from one protein to a similar sequence (homology-based function prediction), knowledge about the corresponding genes in other genomes (orthology-based function prediction) provides more specific information about the protein's function, while the analysis of the sequence in its genomic context (context-based function prediction) provides information about its functional context. Whereas homology-based methods predict the molecular function of a protein, genomic context methods predict the\nshoot development. Transient expression studies in protoplasts indicated that PHR1 retention in the cytosol by SPX4 occurs in a dose- and P-status-dependent manner. Using a luciferase reporter in vivo, SPX4 expression kinetics and stability revealed that SPX4 is a short-lived protein with P-status-dependent turnover. SPX4 protein levels were quickly restored by phosphate resupply to P-limited plants. Unlike its monocot ortholog, AtSPX4 was not stabilized by the phosphate analog phosphite, implying that intracellular P status is sensed by its SPX domain via phosphate-rich metabolite signals. Regulation of double-strand break-induced mammalian homologous recombination by UBL1, a RAD51-interacting protein. Mammalian RAD51 protein plays essential roles in DNA homologous recombination, DNA repair and cell proliferation. RAD51 activities are regulated by its associated proteins. It was previously reported that a ubiquitin-like protein, UBL1, associates with RAD51 in the yeast two-hybrid system. One function of UBL1 is to covalently conjugate with target proteins and thus modify\nthese putative protein-protein or protein-lipid interaction domains to Vav signaling and transforming activity. In contrast to previous observations, we found that the PH domain is critical for Vav transforming activity. Similarly, the CRD was also essential and served a function distinct from that of the PH domain. Although mutation of either domain reduced Vav membrane association, addition of plasma membrane targeting sequences to either the CRD or PH domain mutant proteins did not restore Vav transforming activity. This result contrasts with other Dbl family proteins, where a membrane targeting sequence alone was sufficient to restore the loss of function caused by mutation of the PH domain. Furthermore, green fluorescent protein fusion proteins containing the PH domain or CRD, or both, failed to target to the plasma membrane, suggesting that these two domains also serve regulatory functions independent of promoting membrane localization. Finally, we found that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation may promote\ngpa1 suppression domain, also appear to have related structures. The properties of Syg1p are consistent with those of a transmembrane signaling component that can respond to, or transduce signals through, G beta or G beta gamma. Identification and characterization of interactions between the vertebrate polycomb-group protein BMI1 and human homologs of polyhomeotic. In Drosophila melanogaster, the Polycomb-group (PcG) genes have been identified as repressors of gene expression. They are part of a cellular memory system that is responsible for the stable transmission of gene activity to progeny cells. PcG proteins form a large multimeric, chromatin-associated protein complex, but the identity of its components is largely unknown. Here, we identify two human proteins, HPH1 and HPH2, that are associated with the vertebrate PcG protein BMI1. HPH1 and HPH2 coimmunoprecipitate and cofractionate with each other and with BMI1. They also colocalize with BMI1 in interphase nuclei of U-2 OS human osteosarcoma and\nnot support convergent evolution. Critical role of the pleckstrin homology and cysteine-rich domains in Vav signaling and transforming activity. Vav family proteins are members of the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors and activators of Rho family small GTPases. In addition to the Dbl homology (DH) domain important for guanine nucleotide exchange factor catalytic function, all Dbl family proteins contain an adjacent pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that serves to regulate DH domain activity. Although the role of the PH domain in Vav function has been evaluated extensively, its precise role and whether it serves a distinct role in different Vav proteins remain unresolved. Additionally, the precise role of an adjacent cysteine-rich domain (CRD) in regulating DH domain function is also unclear. In this study, we evaluated the contribution of these putative protein-protein or protein-lipid interaction domains to Vav signaling and transforming activity. In contrast to previous observations, we found\nrice protoplasts and plants. SPX3/5 negatively regulate root-to-shoot Pi translocation with redundant function. The data showed that the Pi-starvation-accumulated SPX3/5 proteins are players in restoring phosphate balance following phosphate starvation. In vitro and in vivo protein-protein interaction analyses indicated that these two proteins can form homodimers and heterodimers, also implying their functional redundancy. Genetic interaction analysis indicated that SPX3/5 are functional repressors of OsPHR2 (PHR2), the rice orthologue of the central regulator AtPHR1 for Pi homeostasis and Pi signalling. These results suggest that the evolution of the additional redundant paralogous SPX genes is beneficial to plants recovering Pi homeostasis after Pi starvation by PHR2 pathway.\nRAD51 in the yeast two-hybrid system. One function of UBL1 is to covalently conjugate with target proteins and thus modify their function. In the present study we found that non-conjugated UBL1 forms a complex with RAD51 and RAD52 proteins in human cells. Overexpression of UBL1 down-regulates DNA double-strand break-induced homologous recombination in CHO cells and reduces cellular resistance to ionizing radiation in HT1080 cells. With or without overexpressed UBL1, most homologous recombination products arise by gene conversion. However, overexpression of UBL1 reduces the fraction of bidirectional gene conversion tracts. Overexpression of a mutant UBL1 that is incapable of being conjugated retains the ability to inhibit homologous recombination. These results suggest a regulatory role for UBL1 in homologous recombination. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder: proteins can recognize binding sites of homologous proteins in more than one way. Understanding the mechanisms of protein-protein interaction is a fundamental problem with\na single site. The affinity difference was largely reflected in a much slower dissociation rate from the 2\u00d7 P1BS-binding site, suggesting an important role for protein co-operativity. Injection of AtSPX1 in the presence of phosphate or inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) failed to alter the MBPAtdPHR1-P1BS dissociation rate, while pre-mixing of these two proteins in the presence of either 5 mM Pi or 500 \u00b5M InsP6 resulted in a much lower DNA-binding signal from MBPAtdPHR1. These data suggest that, in the Pi-restored condition, AtSPX1 can bind to monomeric AtPHR1 in solution and therefore regulate PSI gene expression by tuning the AtPHR1-DNA-binding equilibrium. This Pi-dependent regulation of AtPHR1-DNA-binding equilibrium also generates a negative feedback loop on the expression of AtSPX1 itself, providing a tight control of PSI gene expression. SHORT HYPOCOTYL UNDER BLUE1 truncations and mutations alter its association with a signaling protein complex in Arabidopsis. Higher plants monitor their ambient light signals\nwith each other and with BMI1. They also colocalize with BMI1 in interphase nuclei of U-2 OS human osteosarcoma and SW480 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. HPH1 and HPH2 have little sequence homology with each other, except in two highly conserved domains, designated homology domains I and II. They share these homology domains I and II with the Drosophila PcG protein Polyhomeotic (Ph), and we, therefore, have named the novel proteins HPH1 and HPH2. HPH1, HPH2, and BMI1 show distinct, although overlapping expression patterns in different tissues and cell lines. Two-hybrid analysis shows that homology domain II of HPH1 interacts with both homology domains I and II of HPH2. In contrast, homology domain I of HPH1 interacts only with homology domain II of HPH2, but not with homology domain I of HPH2. Furthermore, BMI1 does not interact with the individual homology domains. Instead, both intact homology domains I and II need\noccurs under phosphate (Pi)-deficient conditions. Here, we identify SlSPX1 (SYG1 (suppressor of yeast GPA1)/Pho81(phosphate 81)/XPR1 (xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor 1) as the major repressor of the AM symbiosis in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) under phosphate-replete conditions. Loss of SlSPX1 function promotes direct Pi uptake and enhances AM colonization under phosphate-replete conditions. We determine that SlSPX1 integrates Pi signaling and AM symbiosis by directly interacting with a set of arbuscule-induced SlPHR proteins (SlPHR1, SlPHR4, SlPHR10, SlPHR11, and SlPHR12). The association with SlSPX1 represses the ability of SlPHR proteins to activate AM marker genes required for the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. SlPHR proteins exhibit functional redundancy, and no defective AM symbiosis was detected in the single mutant of SlPHR proteins. However, silencing SlPHR4 in the Slphr1 mutant background led to reduced AM colonization. Therefore, our results support the conclusion that SlSPX1-SlPHRs form a Pi-sensing module to coordinate the AM symbiosis under different Pi-availability\ntwo domains also serve regulatory functions independent of promoting membrane localization. Finally, we found that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation may promote Vav membrane association via phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate binding to the PH domain. The paralogous SPX3 and SPX5 genes redundantly modulate Pi homeostasis in rice. The importance of SPX-domain-containing proteins to phosphate (Pi) homeostasis and signalling transduction has been established in plants. In this study, phylogenetic analysis revealed that OsSPX3 and OsSPX5 (SPX3/5) are paralogous SPX genes ( SYG1/Pho81/XPR1) in cereal crops. SPX3/5 are specifically responsive to Pi starvation at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Similar tissue expression patterns of the two genes and proteins were identified by in situ hybridization and the transgenic plants harbouring SPX3pro-SPX3-GUS or SPX5pro-SPX5-GUS fusions, respectively. Both SPX3/5 are localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm in rice protoplasts and plants. SPX3/5 negatively regulate root-to-shoot Pi translocation with redundant function. The data showed that the Pi-starvation-accumulated SPX3/5\nTherefore, our results support the conclusion that SlSPX1-SlPHRs form a Pi-sensing module to coordinate the AM symbiosis under different Pi-availability conditions. Inositol Pyrophosphate Pathways and Mechanisms: What Can We Learn from Plants? The ability of an organism to maintain homeostasis in changing conditions is crucial for growth and survival. Eukaryotes have developed complex signaling pathways to adapt to a readily changing environment, including the inositol phosphate (InsP) signaling pathway. In plants and humans the pyrophosphorylated inositol molecules, inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs), have been implicated in phosphate and energy sensing. PP-InsPs are synthesized from the phosphorylation of InsP6, the most abundant InsP. The plant PP-InsP synthesis pathway is similar but distinct from that of the human, which may reflect differences in how molecules such as Ins(1,4,5)P3 and InsP6 function in plants vs. animals. In addition, PP-InsPs can potentially interact with several major signaling proteins in plants, suggesting PP-InsPs play unique signaling roles",

        "desc": "cells and PCM pathogenesis. We cloned the PbPga1 gene that codifies for a predicted GPI-anchored glycoprotein from the dimorphic pathogenic fungus P. brasiliensis. PbPga1 is conserved in Eurotiomycetes fungi and encodes for a protein with potential glycosylation sites in a serine/threonine-rich region, a signal peptide and a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol attachment signal sequence. Specific chicken anti-rPbPga1 antibody localized PbPga1 on the yeast cell surface at the septum between the mother cell and the bud with stronger staining of the bud. The exposure of murine peritoneal macrophages to rPbPga1 induces TNF-\u03b1 release and nitric oxide (NO) production by macrophages. Furthermore, the presence of O-glycosylation sites was demonstrated by \u03b2-elimination under ammonium hydroxide treatment of rPbPga1. Finally, sera from PCM patients recognized rPbPga1 by Western blotting indicating the presence of specific antibodies against rPbPga1. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the PbPga1gene codifies for a cell surface glycoprotein, probably attached to a GPI-anchor,\nwall. These results show that Map4 is not directly bound to beta-glucans and point to the existence of alkali- and SDS/mercaptoethanol-sensitive linkages between cell wall proteins. The N-terminal S/T-rich regions are required for cell wall attachment, but the C-terminal DIPSY domain is required for agglutination and mating in liquid and solid media. The presence of an ER exit signal determines the protein sorting upon ER exit in yeast. In yeast, there are at least two vesicle populations upon ER (endoplasmic reticulum) exit, one containing Gap1p (general aminoacid permease) and a glycosylated alpha-factor, gpalphaF (glycosylated proalpha-factor), and the other containing GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol)-anchored proteins, Gas1p (glycophospholipid-anchored surface protein) and Yps1p. We attempted to identify sorting determinants for this protein sorting event in the ER. We found that mutant Gas1 proteins that lack a GPI anchor and/or S/T region (serine- and threonine-rich region), two common characteristic features conserved among yeast GPI-anchored proteins, were\nmicroscopy also showed a clear separation between FR- and PLAP-rich membrane microdomains. Thus, even though functionally diverse and heterologous GPI-anchored proteins are known to share endocytic and recycling vesicles, they may be segregated in distinct lipid rafts on the basis of their ecto(protein) domains facilitating clustering, compartmentalization and homotypic protein interactions. CLPTM1L is a GPI-anchoring pathway component targeted by HCMV. The GPI-anchoring pathway plays important roles in normal development and immune modulation. MHC Class I Polypeptide-related Sequence A (MICA) is a stress-induced ligand, downregulated by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) to escape immune recognition. Its most prevalent allele, MICA*008, is GPI-anchored via an uncharacterized pathway. Here, we identify cleft lip and palate transmembrane protein 1-like protein (CLPTM1L) as a GPI-anchoring pathway component and show that during infection, the HCMV protein US9 downregulates MICA*008 via CLPTM1L. We show that the expression of some GPI-anchored proteins (CD109, CD59, and MELTF)-but not others (ULBP2, ULBP3)-is\na GPI anchor and/or S/T region (serine- and threonine-rich region), two common characteristic features conserved among yeast GPI-anchored proteins, were still sorted away from Gap1p-containing vesicles. Furthermore, a mutant glycosylated alpha-factor, gpalphaGPI, which contains both the GPI anchor and S/T region from Gas1p, still entered Gap1p-containing vesicles, demonstrating that these conserved characteristics do not prevent proteins from entering Gap1p-containing vesicles. gpalphaF showed severely reduced budding efficiency in the absence of its ER exit receptor Erv29p, and this residual budding product no longer entered Gap1p-containing vesicles. These results suggest that the interaction of gpalphaF with Erv29p is essential for sorting into Gap1p-containing vesicles. We compared the detergent solubility of Gas1p and the gpalphaGPI in the ER with that in ER-derived vesicles. Both GPI-anchored proteins similarly partitioned into the DRM (detergent-resistant membrane) in the ER. Based on the fact that they entered different ER-derived vesicles, we conclude that DRM partitioning of GPI-anchored\nwith the co-receptor BAK1 in a pathogen-induced manner. The double mutation sobir1-12 bak1-5 suppresses edr1-mediated disease resistance, suggesting that EDR1 negatively regulates PTI modulated by the RLP53-SOBIR1-BAK1 complex. Moreover, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein LORELEI-LIKE GPI-ANCHORED PROTEIN1 (LLG1) interacts with RLP53 and mediates RLP53 accumulation in the plasma membrane. We thus uncovered the role of a novel RLP and its associated immune complex in plant defense responses and revealed a potential new mechanism underlying regulation of RLP immune function by a GPI-anchored protein. Evidence for segregation of heterologous GPI-anchored proteins into separate lipid rafts within the plasma membrane. Cholesterol and glycosphingolipid-rich membrane rafts, which are rich in GPI-anchored proteins and are distinct from caveolae, are believed to serve as platforms for signal transduction events and protein recycling. GPI-anchored proteins with diverse functions as well as caveolin may be recovered in a membrane fraction insoluble in cold non-ionic detergent. This study tests\nmembrane. Most MdLTPG genes were induced by abiotic stress treatments such as low temperature, NaCl, and ABA. Finally, the MdLTPG17 protein was shown to interact with the lysine-rich arabinogalactan protein MdAGP18 to perform its function in wax transport during plant growth and development. Characterization of PbPga1, an antigenic GPI-protein in the pathogenic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is the etiologic agent of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), one of the most prevalent mycosis in Latin America. P. brasiliensis cell wall components interact with host cells and influence the pathogenesis of PCM. Cell wall components, such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-proteins play a critical role in cell adhesion and host tissue invasion. Although the importance of GPI-proteins in the pathogenesis of other medically important fungi is recognized, little is known about their function in P. brasiliensis cells and PCM pathogenesis. We cloned the PbPga1 gene that codifies for a predicted GPI-anchored glycoprotein from the dimorphic pathogenic\nformation of a molecular link between cells but may also be an essential feature for binding of autoantibodies and hence determine the role of beta(2)GPI in autoimmune diseases. Distinct interactions among GPI-anchored, transmembrane and membrane associated intracellular proteins, and sphingolipids in lymphocyte and endothelial cell plasma membranes. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoproteins are enriched in sphingolipid-rich plasma membrane domains, which are often isolated as low-density membrane complexes. This association is believed to arise from the interactions between the GPI-acyl chains and sphingolipids, but is not fully understood. In this study, we compared the physical properties of GPI-anchored glycoproteins from a non-polarized (murine T-lymphocyte) and a polarized (human endothelial) cell by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation after extraction by detergents under identical conditions. Unlike those on epithelial cells, the GPI-anchored proteins of lymphocytes (Thy-1 and the heat stable antigen CD24) were enriched in the floating fractions after extraction over a wide range of octylglucoside\nfunctions as well as caveolin may be recovered in a membrane fraction insoluble in cold non-ionic detergent. This study tests for possible heterogeneity in the protein composition of the lipid rafts and detergent-insoluble membrane complexes by examining the two GPI-anchored homologous human folate receptors (FR)-alpha and -beta, the GPI-anchored human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), and caveolin (control) in transfected CHO cells. Both FR and PLAP showed the equal distribution of cell-surface vs. sequestered (recycling) protein typical of GPI-proteins. Quantitative affinity purification of detergent-insoluble complexes using biotinylated folate or specific antibodies demonstrated a strong association of the homologous FR-alpha and FR-beta in the same detergent-insoluble complex and separate complexes containing either PLAP or caveolin. Immunogold localization experiments using antibody crosslinking to produce larger aggregates of GPI-anchored proteins for visualization by electron microscopy also showed a clear separation between FR- and PLAP-rich membrane microdomains. Thus, even though functionally diverse and heterologous GPI-anchored\nin the ER. Based on the fact that they entered different ER-derived vesicles, we conclude that DRM partitioning of GPI-anchored proteins is not the dominant determinant of protein sorting upon ER exit. Interestingly, upon incorporation into the ER-derived vesicles, gpalphaGPI was no longer detergent-insoluble, in contrast with the persistent detergent insolubility of Gas1p in the ER-derived vesicles. We present different explanations for the different behaviours of GPI-anchored proteins in distinct ER-derived vesicle populations. Mechanism of the interaction of beta(2)-glycoprotein I with negatively charged phospholipid membranes. In an attempt to understand the multifunctional involvement of beta(2)-glycoprotein I (beta(2)GPI) in autoimmune diseases, thrombosis, atherosclerosis, and inflammatory processes, substantial interest is focused on the interaction of beta(2)GPI with negatively charged ligands, in particular, with acidic phospholipids. In this study, unilamellar vesicles composed of cardiolipin were used as in vitro membrane system to test and further refine a model of interaction based on the\nand the heat stable antigen CD24) were enriched in the floating fractions after extraction over a wide range of octylglucoside concentrations. In contrast, the floatability of endothelial GPI-anchored CD59 was markedly diminished, not only by octylglucoside, but also by increasing concentrations of Triton X-100. Distribution of cholera toxin binding ganglioside GM1 in the sucrose gradient fractions closely followed that of the GPI-anchored proteins in both lymphocytes and endothelial cells under most extraction conditions. Analysis of the intracellular acylated molecules revealed that a significant amount of p56(lck) was always associated with the floating GPI-rich fractions of lymphocytes when extracted by Triton X-100 or octylglucoside at 4 degrees C, while the behaviour of endothelial cell caveolin was comparable to that of CD59. The transmembrane glycoproteins CD45 in lymphocytes and MHC class I antigen in endothelial cells interacted weakly with GPI domains, whereas endothelial CD44 and lymphocyte CD26 displayed a strong association. These\nand plant lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) play an important role in this process. The glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored LTPs (LTPGs) are a large subgroup within the LTP family and function in lipid transport and wax formation. Although LTPG family members have been identified in several plant species, the LTPG gene family of apple (Malus domestica) remains uncharacterized. In this paper, we identified 26 potential LTPG genes by searching apple whole-genome annotation files using \"GPI-anchored\" and \"lipid transferase\" as keywords. Twenty of the 26 putative LTPG genes were confirmed as MdLTPG family members based on their subcellular localization predictions. The MdLTPGs were divided into four classes based on phylogenetic analysis and functional domain prediction. One member of each class was analyzed for subcellular localization, and all identified members were located on the plasma membrane. Most MdLTPG genes were induced by abiotic stress treatments such as low temperature, NaCl, and ABA. Finally, the MdLTPG17\nvirulence, and it is mediated by covalently bound cell wall proteins termed adhesins. Map4, an adhesin required for mating in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, is N-glycosylated and O-glycosylated, and is an endogenous substrate for the mannosyl transferase Oma4p. Map4 has a modular structure with an N-terminal signal peptide, a serine and threonine (S/T)-rich domain that includes nine repeats of 36 amino acids (rich in serine and threonine residues, but lacking glutamines), and a C-terminal DIPSY domain with no glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchor signal. Map4 can be extracted from cell walls with SDS/mercaptoethanol sample buffer or with mild alkali solutions. After extensive extraction with hot sample buffer, no more protein can be released by beta-glucanases or alkali. Additionally, none of the cysteine residues of the protein is required for its retention at the cell wall. These results show that Map4 is not directly bound to beta-glucans and point to the existence of alkali- and\nModular domain structure in the Candida glabrata adhesin Epa1p, a beta1,6 glucan-cross-linked cell wall protein. The yeast pathogen Candida glabrata adheres avidly to cultured human epithelial cells. This interaction depends on the expression of EPA1, which encodes a lectin belonging to a large family of GPI-anchored glucan-cross-linked cell wall proteins (GPI-CWPs) found in diverse fungal species. To understand the relationship between different domains of EPA1 and its function, we have mapped functional domains of Epa1p and analysed their contribution to Epa1p function. We found that the N-terminal third of the protein contains the ligand-binding domain, and that the GPI anchor is essential both for cross-linking in the cell wall and for Epa1p-mediated adherence. We also found that the C-terminal Ser/Thr-rich domain, characteristic of many GPI-CWPs, was absolutely essential for function. Although Epa1p derivatives lacking the Ser/Thr domain were expressed abundantly in the cell wall, they were localized to internal layers\nof nyctalopin on the surface of the cell rather than the mechanism of anchoring is crucial to its function. Characterization of two novel proteins, NgRH1 and NgRH2, structurally and biochemically homologous to the Nogo-66 receptor. Nogo-66 receptor (NgR) has recently been identified as the neuronal receptor of the myelin-associated proteins Nogo-A, oligodendrocyte protein (OMgp) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and mediates inhibition of axonal regeneration both in vitro and in vivo. Through database searches, we have identified two novel proteins (NgRH1 and NgRH2) that turned out to be homologous in their primary structures, biochemical properties and expression patterns to NgR. Like NgR, the homologues contain eight leucine-rich repeats (LRR) flanked by a leucine-rich repeat C-terminus (LRRCT) and a leucine-rich repeat N-terminus (LRRNT), and also have a C-terminal GPI signal sequence. Northern blot analysis showed predominant expression of NgRH1 and NgRH2 mRNA in the brain. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry on rat\nMICA*008 via CLPTM1L. We show that the expression of some GPI-anchored proteins (CD109, CD59, and MELTF)-but not others (ULBP2, ULBP3)-is CLPTM1L-dependent, and further show that like MICA*008, MELTF is downregulated by US9 via CLPTM1L during infection. Mechanistically, we suggest that CLPTM1L's function depends on its interaction with a free form of PIG-T, normally a part of the GPI transamidase complex. We suggest that US9 inhibits this interaction and thereby downregulates the expression of CLPTM1L-dependent proteins. Altogether, we report on a new GPI-anchoring pathway component that is targeted by HCMV. The Schizosaccharomyces pombe Map4 adhesin is a glycoprotein that can be extracted from the cell wall with alkali but not with beta-glucanases and requires the C-terminal DIPSY domain for function. SUMMARY: In fungi, cell adhesion is required for flocculation, mating and virulence, and it is mediated by covalently bound cell wall proteins termed adhesins. Map4, an adhesin required for mating in\nmouse via a transmembrane domain. We investigated membrane association and attachment for human and mouse nyctalopin and show, conclusively, that human nyctalopin is a GPI anchored protein. In addition, the orthologous mouse protein, although it localizes to the cell surface, is not GPI anchored. We also confirm both mouse and human nyctalopins are glycosylated. Further sequence analysis suggests that chimp, dog and frog nyctalopins are likely to be GPI anchored but that rat nyctalopin is not. This is the first reported example of orthologous proteins which have different mechanisms of cell membrane attachment. Notably, the disease-causing mutations that have been identified to date in the human NYX gene are all distributed throughout the core LRR region and not in the C-terminal GPI anchor signal sequence. We propose that the presence of nyctalopin on the surface of the cell rather than the mechanism of anchoring is crucial to its function. Characterization\nbuffalo BDs (BuBDs) assist the spermatozoa either in their survival or in performance in the FRT. Our results suggest that BuBD-129 is a sperm-surface BD that could have a role in buffalo sperm function. Further studies elucidating its exact physiological function are required to better understand its role in the regulation of male fertility. Species specific membrane anchoring of nyctalopin, a small leucine-rich repeat protein. Mutations in the gene NYX, which encodes nyctalopin, lead to the retinal disorder congenital stationary night blindness which is characterized by defective night vision (nyctalopia) from birth. Nyctalopin is of unknown function but is predicted to be a secreted glycoprotein of the extracellular small leucine-rich repeat (SLRP) proteoglycan and protein family attached to the cell membrane in humans via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor but in mouse via a transmembrane domain. We investigated membrane association and attachment for human and mouse nyctalopin and show, conclusively, that\nantigen in endothelial cells interacted weakly with GPI domains, whereas endothelial CD44 and lymphocyte CD26 displayed a strong association. These results show that: (1) the physical properties of different GPI-anchored proteins may vary significantly; and (2) transmembrane and acylated intracellular proteins could be associated with GPI domains to a variable extent. These differences probably reflect cell type-specific interactions of GPI anchors with the sphingolipid framework of plasma membranes, as well as extracellular interactions of GPI-anchored glycoproteins with neighbouring cell surface molecules. Buffalo sperm surface proteome profiling reveals an intricate relationship between innate immunity and reproduction. BACKGROUND: Low conception rate (CR) despite insemination with morphologically normal spermatozoa is a common reproductive restraint that limits buffalo productivity. This accounts for a significant loss to the farmers and the dairy industry, especially in agriculture-based economies. The immune-related proteins on the sperm surface are known to regulate fertility by assisting the spermatozoa in their\nblot analysis showed predominant expression of NgRH1 and NgRH2 mRNA in the brain. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry on rat brain slices revealed neuronal expression of the genes. NgRH1 and NgRH2 were detected on the cell surface of recombinant cell lines as N-glycosylated GPI anchored proteins and, consistent with other GPI anchored proteins, were localized within the lipid rafts of cellular membranes. In addition, an N-terminal proteolytic fragment of NgR comprising the majority of the ectodomain was found to be constitutively secreted from cells. Our data indicate that NgR, NgRH1 and NgRH2 constitute a novel receptor protein family, which may play related roles within the CNS. Identification and functional analysis of the MdLTPG gene family in apple. Cuticular wax is synthesized from intracellular lipids that are exported by epidermal cells, and plant lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) play an important role in this process. The glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored LTPs (LTPGs) are a\ncarried out at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by an enzyme complex called GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GlcNAc transferase). The human enzyme has six known subunits, at least four of which, GPI1, PIG-A, PIG-C, and PIG-H, have functional homologs in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The uncharacterized yeast gene YDR437w encodes a protein with some sequence similarity to human PIG-P, a fifth subunit of the GPI-GlcNAc transferase. Here we show that Ydr437w is a small but essential subunit of the yeast GPI-GlcNAc transferase, and we designate its gene GPI19. Similar to other mutants in the yeast enzyme, temperature-sensitive gpi19 mutants display cell wall defects and hyperactive Ras phenotypes. The Gpi19 protein associates with the yeast GPI-GlcNAc transferase in vivo, as judged by coimmuneprecipitation with the Gpi2 subunit. Moreover, conditional gpi19 mutants are defective for GPI-GlcNAc transferase activity in vitro. Finally, we present evidence for the topology of Gpi19 within the ER membrane.",

        "desc": "in the development of neuropathic pain and hyperalgesia. In humans, disease-related changes in TRPV1 expression have already been described (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome). The mechanisms that regulate TRPV1 gene expression under pathological conditions are unknown but a better understanding of these pathways has obvious implications for rational drug development. Direct evidence for functional TRPV1/TRPA1 heteromers. Transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1) plays a key role in sensing environmental hazards and in enhanced pain sensation following inflammation. A considerable proportion of TRPV1-expressing cells also express transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily A, member 1 (TRPA1). There is evidence for a TRPV1-TRPA1 interaction that is predominantly calcium-dependent, and it has been suggested that the two proteins might form a heteromeric channel. Here, we constructed subunit concatemers to search for direct evidence for such an interaction. We found that a TRPV1::TRPV1 concatemer and TRPV1 formed\nBiochemical pharmacology of the vanilloid receptor TRPV1. An update. There is mounting evidence that the vanilloid (capsaicin) receptor; transient receptor potential channel, vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1), is subjected to multiple interacting levels of control. The first level is by reversible phosphorylation catalyzed by intrinsic kinases (e.g. protein kinase A and C) and phosphatases (e.g. calcineurin), which plays a pivotal role in receptor sensitization vs. tachyphylaxis. In addition, this mechanism links TRPV1 to intracellular signaling by various important endogenous as well as exogenous substances such as bradykinin, ethanol, nicotin and insulin. It is not clear, however, whether phosphorylation per se is sufficient to liberate TRPV1 under the inhibitory control of phosphatydylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate. The second level of control is by forming TRPV1 heteromers and their association with putative regulatory proteins. The next level of regulation is by subcellular compartmentalization. The membrane form of TRPV1 functions as a nonselective cation channel. On the\nevidence of such a complex. In electrophysiology studies, mutation of the Ca(2+)-CaM-binding site on TRPV1-ARD abolished desensitization in response to repeated application of capsaicin, whereas mutation of the Ca(2+)-CaM-binding site in TRPV1-CT led to a more subtle phenotype of slowed and reduced TRPV1 desensitization. In summary, our results show that the TRPV1-ARD is an important mediator of TRPV1 desensitization, whereas TRPV1-CT has higher affinity for CaM and is likely involved in separate regulatory mechanisms. Antinociceptive Activity of Vanilloids in Caenorhabditis elegans is Mediated by the Desensitization of the TRPV Channel OCR-2 and Specific Signal Transduction Pathways. Vanilloids, including capsaicin and eugenol, are ligands of transient receptor potential channel vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1). Prolonged treatment with vanilloids triggered the desensitization of TRPV1, leading to analgesic or antinociceptive effects. Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is a model organism expressing vanilloid receptor orthologs (e.g., OSM-9 and OCR-2) that are associated with behavioral and\ncoefficient similar to TRPV1. However, the channel formed by TRPV1::TRPA1 has only two binding sites for capsaicin and shows less total current and a smaller capsaicin-induced shift in voltage-dependent gating than TRPV1::TRPV1 or TRPV1. We conclude that the presence of TRPA1 exerts a functional inhibition on TRPV1. Distinct properties of Ca2+-calmodulin binding to N- and C-terminal regulatory regions of the TRPV1 channel. Transient receptor potential (TRP) vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a molecular pain receptor belonging to the TRP superfamily of nonselective cation channels. As a polymodal receptor, TRPV1 responds to heat and a wide range of chemical stimuli. The influx of calcium after channel activation serves as a negative feedback mechanism leading to TRPV1 desensitization. The cellular calcium sensor calmodulin (CaM) likely participates in the desensitization of TRPV1. Two CaM-binding sites are identified in TRPV1: the N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) and a short distal C-terminal (CT) segment. Here, we\nmembers mediate functionally critical intramolecular interactions (i.e., within one subunit) between these regions. This review provides an overview on (1) intramolecular interactions in TRP channels and their effect on channel function; (2) functional roles of interplays between PIP2 (and other ligands) and TRP intramolecular interactions; and (3) relevance of the ligand-induced modulation of intramolecular interaction to diseases. Rapid, opioid-sensitive mechanisms involved in transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 sensitization. TRPV1 is a nociceptive, Ca2+-selective ion channel involved in the development of several painful conditions. Sensitization of TRPV1 responses by cAMP-dependent PKA crucially contributes to the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia. However, the pathways involved in potentiation of TRPV1 responses by cAMP-dependent PKA remain largely unknown. Using HEK cells stably expressing TRPV1 and the mu opioid receptor, we demonstrated that treatment with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin significantly increased the multimeric TRPV1 species. Pretreatment with the mu opioid receptor agonist morphine reversed this\nTPP results show that capsaicin and eugenol target OCR-2 but not OSM-9. Further protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses showed other targets associated with enzymatic catalysis and calcium ion binding activity. The resulting data help to better understand the broad-spectrum pharmacological activity of vanilloids. Vitamin D is an endogenous partial agonist of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 channel. KEY POINTS: 25-Hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) is a partial agonist of TRPV1 whereby 25OHD can weakly activate TRPV1 yet antagonize the stimulatory effects of the full TRPV1 agonists capsaicin and oleoyl dopamine. 25OHD binds to TRPV1 within the same vanilloid binding pocket as capsaicin. 25OHD inhibits the potentiating effects of PKC-mediated TRPV1 activity. 25OHD reduces T-cell activation and trigeminal neuron calcium signalling mediated by TRPV1 activity. These results provide evidence that TRPV1 is a novel receptor for the biological actions of vitamin D in addition to the well-documented effects of vitamin D upon the\nassociation of TRPA1 with TRPV1 was not affected in Ca(2+)-free media. To assess a role of intracellular Ca(2+) in TRPV1-dependent modulation of TRPA1 modulation, the TRPA1-mediated single channel WIN55,212-2-gated current (I(WIN)) was recorded in inside-out configuration. Our data indicate that single channel properties of TRPA1 are regulated by TRPV1 independently of intracellular Ca(2+). In summary, our results support the hypothesis that TRPV1 and TRPA1 form a complex and that TRPV1 influences intrinsic characteristics of the TRPA1 channel. Roles of Intramolecular Interactions in the Regulation of TRP Channels. The transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, classified into six (-A, -V, -P, -C, -M, -ML, -N and -Y) subfamilies, are important membrane sensors and mediators of diverse stimuli including pH, light, mechano-force, temperature, pain, taste, and smell. The mammalian TRP superfamily of 28 members share similar membrane topology with six membrane-spanning helices (S1-S6) and cytosolic N-/C-terminus. Abnormal function or expression of TRP channels\nnovel receptor for the biological actions of vitamin D in addition to the well-documented effects of vitamin D upon the nuclear vitamin D receptor. The results may have important implications for our current understanding of certain diseases where TRPV1 and vitamin D deficiency have been implicated, such as chronic pain and autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes.ABSTRACT: The capsaicin receptor TRPV1 plays an important role in nociception, inflammation and immunity and its activity is regulated by exogenous and endogenous lipophilic ligands. As vitamin D is lipophilic and involved in similar biological processes as TRPV1, we hypothesized that it directly regulates TRPV1 activity and function. Our calcium imaging and electrophysiological data demonstrate that vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D (1,25OHD)) can weakly activate TRPV1 at physiologically relevant concentrations (100 nM). Furthermore, both 25OHD and 1,25OHD can inhibit capsaicin-induced TRPV1 activity (IC50 = 34.3 \u00b1 0.2 and 11.5 \u00b1\nand can be dynamically modulated by activation of the mu opioid receptor under conditions where cAMP levels are raised, such as with inflammation. Increased translocation and multimerization of TRPV1 channels provide a cellular mechanism for fine-tuning of nociceptive responses that allow for rapid modulation of TRPV1 responses independent of transcriptional changes. Association of TRPV1 and TLR4 through the TIR domain potentiates TRPV1 activity by blocking activation-induced desensitization. BACKGROUND: We have previously reported that histamine-induced pruritus was attenuated in toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) knockout mice due to decreased transient receptor potential V1 (TRPV1) sensitivity. Our results implied that TLR4 potentiated TRPV1 activation in sensory neurons; however, the molecular mechanism has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of TLR4-mediated TRPV1 potentiation using TLR4-deficient sensory neurons and a heterologous expression system.METHODS: Primary sensory neurons were obtained from wild-type or TLR4 knockout mice, and HEK293T cells expressing TRPV1\n(100 nM). Furthermore, both 25OHD and 1,25OHD can inhibit capsaicin-induced TRPV1 activity (IC50 = 34.3 \u00b1 0.2 and 11.5 \u00b1 0.9 nM, respectively), but not pH-induced TRPV1 activity, suggesting that vitamin D interacts with TRPV1 in the same region as the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin. This hypothesis is supported by our in silico TRPV1 structural modelling studies, which place 25OHD in the same binding region as capsaicin. 25OHD also attenuates PKC-dependent TRPV1 potentiation via interactions with a known PKC phospho-acceptor residue in TRPV1. To provide evidence for a physiological role for the interaction of vitamin D with TRPV1, we employed two different cellular models known to express TRPV1: mouse CD4+ T-cells and trigeminal neurons. Our results indicate that 25OHD reduces TRPV1-induced cytokine release from T-cells and capsaicin-induced calcium activity in trigeminal neurons. In summary, we provide evidence that vitamin D is a novel endogenous regulator of TRPV1 channel activity that may\nneurons. In summary, we provide evidence that vitamin D is a novel endogenous regulator of TRPV1 channel activity that may play an important physiological role in addition to its known effects through the canonical nuclear vitamin D receptor pathway. Contribution of TRPV1-TRPA1 interaction to the single channel properties of the TRPA1 channel. Several lines of evidence suggest that TRPA1 and TRPV1 mutually control the transduction of inflammation-induced noxious stimuli in sensory neurons. It was recently shown that certain TRPA1 properties are modulated by TRPV1. However, direct interaction between TRPA1 and TRPV1 as well as regulation of TRPA1 intrinsic characteristics by the TRPV1 channel have not been examined. To address these questions, we have studied a complex formation between TRPA1 and TRPV1 and characterized the influence of TRPV1 on single channel TRPA1-mediated currents. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed direct interactions between TRPA1 and TRPV1 in an expression system as well as in sensory\na heterologous expression system.METHODS: Primary sensory neurons were obtained from wild-type or TLR4 knockout mice, and HEK293T cells expressing TRPV1 and TLR4 were prepared by transient transfection. TRPV1 activity was analyzed by calcium imaging, fluorophotometry, and patch-clamp recording. Subcellular protein distribution was tested by immunocytochemistry and cell surface biotinylation assay. Protein interaction was assessed by western blot and immunoprecipitation assay.RESULTS: Direct association between TRPV1 and TLR4 was detected in HEK293T cells upon heterologous TRPV1 and TLR4 expression. In an immunoprecipitation assay using TLR4-deletion mutants and soluble toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) protein, the cytoplasmic TIR domain of TLR4 was required for TLR4-TRPV1 association and TRPV1 potentiation. In TLR4-deficient sensory neurons, the activation-induced desensitization of TRPV1 increased, accompanied by enhanced TRPV1 clearance from the cell membrane upon activation compared to wild-type neurons. In addition, heterologous TLR4 expression inhibited activation-induced TRPV1 endocytosis and lysosomal degradation in HEK293T cells.CONCLUSION: Our data show that direct association\nTRPA1-mediated currents. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed direct interactions between TRPA1 and TRPV1 in an expression system as well as in sensory neurons. Data generated with total internal reflection fluorescence-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer indicate that a TRPA1-TRPV1 complex can be formed on the plasma membrane. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer interaction between TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels is as effective as for TRPV1 or TRPA1 homomers. Single channel analysis in a heterologous expression system and in sensory neurons of wild type and TRPV1 knock-out mice demonstrated that co-expression of TRPV1 with TRPA1 results in outward rectification of single channel mustard oil (I(MO)) current-voltage relationships (I-V) and substantial modulation of the open probability at negative holding potentials. TRPV1 also does not influence the characteristics of single channel I(MO) in Ca(2+)-free extracellular solution. However, association of TRPA1 with TRPV1 was not affected in Ca(2+)-free media. To assess a role of intracellular Ca(2+) in TRPV1-dependent\nlevel of regulation is by subcellular compartmentalization. The membrane form of TRPV1 functions as a nonselective cation channel. On the endoplasmic reticulum, TRPV1 is present in two differentially regulated forms, one of which is inositol triphosphate-dependent whereas the other is not. These three TRPV1 compartments provide a versatile regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) levels. Last, there is a complex and poorly understood regulation of TRPV1 activity via control of gene expression. Factors that downregulate TRPV1 expression include vanilloid treatment and growth factor (notably, nerve growth factor) deprivation. By contrast, TRPV1 appears to be upregulated during inflammatory conditions. Interestingly, following experimental nerve injury and in animal models of diabetic neuropathy TRPV1 is present on neurons that do not normally express TRPV1. Combined, these findings imply an important role for aberrant TRPV1 expression in the development of neuropathic pain and hyperalgesia. In humans, disease-related changes in TRPV1 expression have already been described (e.g.\n(C. elegans) is a model organism expressing vanilloid receptor orthologs (e.g., OSM-9 and OCR-2) that are associated with behavioral and physiological processes, including sensory transduction. We have shown that capsaicin and eugenol hamper the nocifensive response to noxious heat in C. elegans. The objective of this study was to perform proteomics to identify proteins and pathways responsible for the induced phenotype and to identify capsaicin and eugenol targets using a thermal proteome profiling (TPP) strategy. The results indicated hierarchical differences following Reactome Pathway enrichment analyses between capsaicin- and eugenol-treated nematodes. However, both treated groups were associated mainly with signal transduction pathways, energy generation, biosynthesis and structural processes. Wnt signaling, a specific signal transduction pathway, is involved following treatment with both molecules. Wnt signaling pathway is noticeably associated with pain. The TPP results show that capsaicin and eugenol target OCR-2 but not OSM-9. Further protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses showed other targets\nmembers share similar membrane topology with six membrane-spanning helices (S1-S6) and cytosolic N-/C-terminus. Abnormal function or expression of TRP channels is associated with cancer, skeletal dysplasia, immunodeficiency, and cardiac, renal, and neuronal diseases. The majority of TRP members share common functional regulators such as phospholipid PIP2, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), and cannabinoid, while other ligands are more specific, such as allyl isothiocyanate (TRPA1), vanilloids (TRPV1), menthol (TRPM8), ADP-ribose (TRPM2), and ML-SA1 (TRPML1). The mechanisms underlying the gating and regulation of TRP channels remain largely unclear. Recent advances in cryogenic electron microscopy provided structural insights into 19 different TRP channels which all revealed close proximity of the C-terminus with the N-terminus and intracellular S4-S5 linker. Further studies found that some highly conserved residues in these regions of TRPV, -P, -C and -M members mediate functionally critical intramolecular interactions (i.e., within one subunit) between these regions. This review provides an overview on (1)\nsubunit concatemers to search for direct evidence for such an interaction. We found that a TRPV1::TRPV1 concatemer and TRPV1 formed channels with similar properties. A TRPV1::TRPA1 concatemer was responsive to TRPV1 agonists capsaicin, acidic pH and ethanol, but not to TRPA1 agonists. Isolated TRPV1 and TRPV1::TRPA1 imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM) both had molecular volumes consistent with the formation of tetrameric channels. Antibodies decorated epitope tags on TRPV1 with a four-fold symmetry, as expected for a homotetramer. In contrast, pairs of antibodies decorated tags on TRPV1::TRPA1 predominantly at 180\u00b0, indicating the formation of a channel consisting of two TRPV1::TRPA1 concatemers arranged face to face. TRPV1::TRPA1 was sensitized by PKC activation and could be inhibited by a TRPV1 antagonist. TRPV1::TRPA1 was activated by heat and displayed a threshold and temperature coefficient similar to TRPV1. However, the channel formed by TRPV1::TRPA1 has only two binding sites for capsaicin and shows less\nadenylate cyclase activator forskolin significantly increased the multimeric TRPV1 species. Pretreatment with the mu opioid receptor agonist morphine reversed this increased TRPV1 multimerization. FRET analysis revealed that treatment with forskolin did not cause multimerization of pre-existing TRPV1 monomers on the plasma membrane and that intracellular pools of TRPV1 exist mostly as monomers in this model. This suggests that increased TRPV1 multimerization occurred from an intracellular store of inactive TRPV1 monomers. Treatment with forskolin also caused an increase in TRPV1 expression on the plasma membrane not resulting from increased TRPV1 expression, and this rapid TRPV1 translocation was inhibited by treatment with morphine. Thus, potentiation of TRPV1 responses by cAMP-dependent PKA involves plasma membrane insertion of functional TRPV1 multimers formed from an intracellular store of inactive TRPV1 monomers. This potentiation occurs rapidly and can be dynamically modulated by activation of the mu opioid receptor under conditions where cAMP levels are raised, such\nsites are identified in TRPV1: the N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) and a short distal C-terminal (CT) segment. Here, we present the crystal structure of calcium-bound CaM (Ca(2+)-CaM) in complex with the TRPV1-CT segment, determined to 1.95-\u00c5 resolution. The two lobes of Ca(2+)-CaM wrap around a helical TRPV1-CT segment in an antiparallel orientation, and two hydrophobic anchors, W787 and L796, contact the C-lobe and N-lobe of Ca(2+)-CaM, respectively. This structure is similar to canonical Ca(2+)-CaM-peptide complexes, although TRPV1 contains no classical CaM recognition sequence motif. Using structural and mutational studies, we established the TRPV1 C terminus as a high affinity Ca(2+)-CaM-binding site in both the isolated TRPV1 C terminus and in full-length TRPV1. Although a ternary complex of CaM, TRPV1-ARD, and TRPV1-CT had previously been postulated, we found no biochemical evidence of such a complex. In electrophysiology studies, mutation of the Ca(2+)-CaM-binding site on TRPV1-ARD abolished desensitization in response to\naddition, heterologous TLR4 expression inhibited activation-induced TRPV1 endocytosis and lysosomal degradation in HEK293T cells.CONCLUSION: Our data show that direct association between TRPV1 and TLR4 through the TIR domain enhances TRPV1 activity by blocking activation-induced TRPV1 desensitization.",

Regulation of the two-pore domain potassium channel, THIK-1 and THIK-2, by G protein coupled receptors. A member of THIK (two pore domain halothane-inhibited K+) channels, THIK-1, was reported as a target of Gi/o-coupled receptors (Gi/o-Rs) in neurons and microglia. We confirmed that in HEK293T cells the THIK-1 channel is activated by Gi/o-Rs and found that Gq-coupled receptors (Gq-Rs) also activates the channel. The effects of Gi/o-Rs and Gq-Rs were inhibited by the Gi/o inhibitor pertussis toxin and phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor, respectively. The effects of Gi/o-Rs were attenuated when consensus G\u03b2\u03b3 binding motif at the C-tail of the THIK-1 channel was mutated, suggesting that G\u03b2\u03b3 serves as a THIK-1 channel activator upon the stimulation of\nchannel. Interestingly, heterodimeric channels of THIK-1 and THIK-2 responded to Gi/o-R and Gq-R stimulation. Taken together, Gi/o- or Gq-Rs activates the THIK-1 and THIK-2 channels in a G\u03b2\u03b3 or PLC dependent manner, respectively. THIK-1 and THIK-2, a novel subfamily of tandem pore domain K+ channels. Two cDNAs encoding novel K(+) channels, THIK-1 and THIK-2 (tandem pore domain halothane inhibited K(+) channel), were isolated from rat brain. The proteins of 405 and 430 amino acids were 58% identical to each other. Homology analysis showed that the novel channels form a separate subfamily among tandem pore domain K(+) channels. The genes of the human orthologs were identified as human genomic data base entries. They possess one intron each and were assigned to chromosomal region 14q24.1-14q24.3 (human (h) THIK-1) and 2p22-2p21 (hTHIK-2). In rat (r), THIK-1 (rTHIK-1) is expressed ubiquitously; rTHIK-2 expression was found in several tissues including brain and kidney. In situ\npH sensitivity and ruthenium red insensitivity (characteristic of TASK-1), indicating the formation of TASK-1/TASK-3 heterodimers. Expression of a tandem construct in which TASK-3 and TASK-1 were linked together yielded currents with features very similar to those observed when coexpressing the two channels. The tandem construct also responded to AT(1a) angiotensin II receptor stimulation with an inhibition that was weaker than the inhibition of homodimeric TASK-1 and greater than that shown by TASK-3. Expression of epitope-tagged channels in mammalian cells showed their primary presence in the plasma membrane consistent with their function in this location. Heteromerization of two-pore domain potassium channels may provide a greater functional diversity and additional means by which they can be regulated in their native tissues. Tandem pore domain halothane-inhibited K+ channel subunits THIK1 and THIK2 assemble and form active channels. Despite a high level of sequence homology, tandem pore domain halothane-inhibited K(+) channel 1 (THIK1) produces\nrat (r), THIK-1 (rTHIK-1) is expressed ubiquitously; rTHIK-2 expression was found in several tissues including brain and kidney. In situ hybridization of brain slices showed that rTHIK-2 is strongly expressed in most brain regions, whereas rTHIK-1 expression is more restricted. Heterologous expression of rTHIK-1 in Xenopus oocytes revealed a K(+) channel displaying weak inward rectification in symmetrical K(+) solution. The current was enhanced by arachidonic acid and inhibited by halothane. rTHIK-2 did not functionally express. Confocal microscopy of oocytes injected with green fluorescent protein-tagged rTHIK-1 or rTHIK-2 showed that both channel subunits are targeted to the outer membrane. However, coinjection of rTHIK-2 did not affect the currents induced by rTHIK-1, indicating that the two channel subunits do not form heteromers. Formation of functional heterodimers between the TASK-1 and TASK-3 two-pore domain potassium channel subunits. The potassium channels in the two-pore domain family are widely expressed and regulate the excitability of\ninhibits breakdown of cAMP and thus activates protein kinase A (PKA). Surprisingly, THIK-1 current was inhibited when IBMX was applied from the extracellular side of the membrane, but not from the intracellular side. Our results suggest that IBMX binds directly to the channel and that the inhibition of THIK-1 current was not related to activation of PKA. Formation of Functional Heterodimers by TREK-1 and TREK-2 Two-pore Domain Potassium Channel Subunits. Two-pore domain (K2P) potassium channels are the major molecular correlates of the background (leak) K(+) current in a wide variety of cell types. They generally play a key role in setting the resting membrane potential and regulate the response of excitable cells to various stimuli. K2P channels usually function as homodimers, and only a few examples of heteromerization have been previously reported. Expression of the TREK (TWIK-related K(+) channel) subfamily members of K2P channels often overlaps in neurons and in\nchannels. The Phosphodiesterase Inhibitor IBMX Blocks the Potassium Channel THIK-1 from the Extracellular Side. The two-pore domain potassium channel (K2P-channel) THIK-1 has several predicted protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation sites. In trying to elucidate whether THIK-1 is regulated via PKA, we expressed THIK-1 channels in a mammalian cell line (CHO cells) and used the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (IBMX) as a pharmacological tool to induce activation of PKA. Using the whole-cell patch-clamp recording, we found that THIK-1 currents were inhibited by application of IBMX with an IC50 of 120 \u00b5M. Surprisingly, intracellular application of IBMX or of the second messenger cAMP via the patch pipette had no effect on THIK-1 currents. In contrast, extracellular application of IBMX produced a rapid and reversible inhibition of THIK-1. In patch-clamp experiments with outside-out patches, THIK-1 currents were also inhibited by extracellular application of IBMX. Expression of THIK-1 channels in Xenopus oocytes was used to\ndomain potassium channel subunits. The potassium channels in the two-pore domain family are widely expressed and regulate the excitability of neurons and other excitable cells. These channels have been shown to function as dimers, but heteromerization between the various channel subunits has not yet been reported. Here we demonstrate that two members of the TASK subfamily of potassium channels, TASK-1 and TASK-3, can form functional heterodimers when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. To recognize the two TASK channel types, we took advantage of the higher sensitivity of TASK-1 over TASK-3 to physiological pH changes and the discriminating sensitivity of TASK-3 to the cationic dye ruthenium red. These features were clearly observed when the channels were expressed individually. However, when TASK-1 and TASK-3 were expressed together, the resulting current showed intermediate pH sensitivity and ruthenium red insensitivity (characteristic of TASK-1), indicating the formation of TASK-1/TASK-3 heterodimers. Expression of a tandem construct\nTHIK-1 currents were also inhibited by extracellular application of IBMX. Expression of THIK-1 channels in Xenopus oocytes was used to compare wild-type channels with mutated channels. Mutation of the putative PKA phosphorylation sites did not change the inhibitory effect of IBMX on THIK-1 currents. Mutational analysis of all residues of the (extracellular) helical cap of THIK-1 showed that mutation of the arginine residue at position 92, which is in the linker between cap helix 2 and pore helix 1, markedly reduced the inhibitory effect of IBMX. This flexible linker region, which is unique for each K2P-channel subtype, may be a possible target of channel-specific blockers. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The potassium channel THIK-1 is strongly expressed in the central nervous system. We studied the effect of 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (IBMX) on THIK-1 currents. IBMX inhibits breakdown of cAMP and thus activates protein kinase A (PKA). Surprisingly, THIK-1 current was inhibited when IBMX was applied\nHeterodimerization within the TREK channel subfamily produces a diverse family of highly regulated potassium channels. Twik-related K(+) channel 1 (TREK1), TREK2, and Twik-related arachidonic-acid stimulated K(+) channel (TRAAK) form the TREK subfamily of two-pore-domain K(+) (K2P) channels. Despite sharing up to 78% sequence homology and overlapping expression profiles in the nervous system, these channels show major differences in their regulation by physiological stimuli. For instance, TREK1 is inhibited by external acidification, whereas TREK2 is activated. Here, we investigated the ability of the members of the TREK subfamily to assemble to form functional heteromeric channels with novel properties. Using single-molecule pull-down (SiMPull) from HEK cell lysate and subunit counting in the plasma membrane of living cells, we show that TREK1, TREK2, and TRAAK readily coassemble. TREK1 and TREK2 can each heterodimerize with TRAAK, but do so less efficiently than with each other. We functionally characterized the heterodimers and found that all\nFormation of TREK-1/TREK-2 channels was also demonstrated in native dorsal root ganglion neurons indicating that heterodimerization may provide greater diversity of leak K(+) conductances also in native tissues. Modulation of TASK-1 (Kcnk3) and TASK-3 (Kcnk9) potassium channels: volatile anesthetics and neurotransmitters share a molecular site of action. TASK-1 and TASK-3, members of the two-pore-domain channel family, are widely expressed leak potassium channels responsible for maintenance of cell membrane potential and input resistance. They are sites of action for a variety of modulatory agents, including volatile anesthetics and neurotransmitters/hormones, the latter acting via mechanisms that have remained elusive. To clarify these mechanisms, we generated mutant channels and found that alterations disrupting anesthetic (halothane) activation of these channels also disrupted transmitter (thyrotropin-releasing hormone, TRH) inhibition and did so to a similar degree. For both TASK-1 and TASK-3, mutations (substitutions with corresponding residues from TREK-1) in a six-residue sequence at the beginning of\nand form active channels. Despite a high level of sequence homology, tandem pore domain halothane-inhibited K(+) channel 1 (THIK1) produces background K(+) currents, whereas THIK2 is silent. This lack of activity is due to a unique combination of intracellular retention and weak basal activity in the plasma membrane. Here, we designed THIK subunits containing dominant negative mutations (THIK1(DN) and THIK2(DN)). THIK2(DN) mutant inhibits THIK1 currents, whereas THIK1(DN) inhibits an activated form of THIK2 (THIK2-A155P-I158D). In situ proximity ligation assays and F\u00f6rster/fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments support a physical association between THIK1 and THIK2. Next, we expressed covalent tandems of THIK proteins to obtain expression of pure heterodimers. Td-THIK1-THIK2 (where Td indicates tandem) produces K(+) currents of amplitude similar to Td-THIK1-THIK1 but with a noticeable difference in the current kinetics. Unlike Td-THIK2-THIK2 that is mainly detected in the endoplasmic reticulum, Td-THIK1-THIK2 distributes at the plasma membrane, indicating that THIK1 can\nwith TRAAK, but do so less efficiently than with each other. We functionally characterized the heterodimers and found that all combinations form outwardly rectifying potassium-selective channels but with variable voltage sensitivity and pH regulation. TREK1-TREK2 heterodimers show low levels of activity at physiological external pH but, unlike their corresponding homodimers, are activated by both acidic and alkaline conditions. Modeling based on recent crystal structures, along with mutational analysis, suggests that each subunit within a TREK1-TREK2 channel is regulated independently via titratable His. Finally, TREK1/TRAAK heterodimers differ in function from TRAAK homodimers in two critical ways: they are activated by both intracellular acidification and alkalinization and are regulated by the enzyme phospholipase D2. Thus, heterodimerization provides a means for diversifying functionality through an expansion of the channel types within the K2P channels. The Phosphodiesterase Inhibitor IBMX Blocks the Potassium Channel THIK-1 from the Extracellular Side. The two-pore domain potassium channel (K2P-channel)\nC-tail of the THIK-1 channel was mutated, suggesting that G\u03b2\u03b3 serves as a THIK-1 channel activator upon the stimulation of Gi/o-Rs. As to the effects of Gq-Rs on the THIK-1 channel, a protein kinase C inhibitor and calcium chelators failed to inhibit the effect of a Gq coupled muscarinic M1R. Neither the hydrolysis of phosphatidyl inositol bisphosphate induced by voltage sensitive phosphatase nor the application of a diacylglycerol analogue, OAG, increased the channel current. The mediator of Gq-dependent activation of the THIK-1 channel remained unsolved. The effects of Gi/o- and Gq-Rs on the THIK-2 channel were also investigated, by using a THIK-2 mutant channel whose N-terminal domain is deleted to improve the surface membrane expression. We observed that Gi/o- and Gq-Rs activate the mutated THIK-2 channel, similarly to the THIK-1 channel. Interestingly, heterodimeric channels of THIK-1 and THIK-2 responded to Gi/o-R and Gq-R stimulation. Taken together, Gi/o- or Gq-Rs activates\npreviously reported. Expression of the TREK (TWIK-related K(+) channel) subfamily members of K2P channels often overlaps in neurons and in other excitable cells. Here, we demonstrate that heterologous coexpression of TREK-1 and TREK-2 subunits results in the formation of functional heterodimers. Taking advantage of a tandem construct (in which the two different subunits were linked together to enforce heterodimerization), we characterized the biophysical and pharmacological properties of the TREK-1/TREK-2 current. The heteromer was inhibited by extracellular acidification and by spadin similarly to TREK-1, and its ruthenium red sensitivity was intermediate between TREK-1 and TREK-2 homodimers. The heterodimer has also been distinguished from the homodimers by its unique single channel conductance. Assembly of the two different subunits was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged TREK-1 and TREK-2 subunits, coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes. Formation of TREK-1/TREK-2 channels was also demonstrated in native dorsal root ganglion neurons indicating that heterodimerization may provide greater diversity\nFor both TASK-1 and TASK-3, mutations (substitutions with corresponding residues from TREK-1) in a six-residue sequence at the beginning of the cytoplasmic C terminus virtually abolished both anesthetic activation and transmitter inhibition. The only sequence motif identified with a classical signaling mechanism in this region is a potential phosphorylation site; however, mutation of this site failed to disrupt modulation. TASK-1 and TASK-3 differed insofar as a large portion of the C terminus was necessary for the full effects of halothane and TRH on TASK-3 but not on TASK-1. Finally, tandem-linked TASK-1/TASK-3 heterodimeric channels were fully modulated by anesthetic and transmitter, and introduction of the identified mutations either into the TASK-1 or the TASK-3 portion of the channel was sufficient to disrupt both effects. Thus, both anesthetic activation and transmitter inhibition of these channels require a region at the interface between the final transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic C terminus that\nof these channels require a region at the interface between the final transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic C terminus that has not been associated previously with receptor signal transduction. Our results also indicate a close molecular relationship between these two forms of modulation, one endogenous and the other clinically applied. Regulation of two-pore-domain (K2P) potassium leak channels by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Two-pore-domain potassium (K2P) channels mediate potassium background (or 'leak') currents, controlling excitability by stabilizing membrane potential below firing threshold and expediting repolarization. Inhibition of K2P currents permits membrane potential depolarization and excitation. As expected for key regulators of excitability, leak channels are under tight control from a plethora of stimuli. Recently, signalling via protein tyrosine kinases (TKs) has been implicated in ion channel modulation. The objective of this study was to investigate TK regulation of K2P channels.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The two-electrode voltage clamp technique was\nThe objective of this study was to investigate TK regulation of K2P channels.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The two-electrode voltage clamp technique was used to record K2P currents in Xenopus oocytes. In addition, K2P channels were studied in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using the whole-cell patch clamp technique.KEY RESULTS: Here, we report inhibition of human K2P3.1 (TASK-1) currents by the TK antagonist, genistein, in Xenopus oocytes (IC50=10.7 microM) and in CHO cells (IC50=12.3 microM). The underlying molecular mechanism was studied in detail. hK2P3.1 was not affected by genistin, an inactive analogue of genistein. Perorthovanadate, an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatase activity, reduced the inhibitory effect of genistein. Current reduction was voltage independent and did not require channel protonation at position H98 or phosphorylation at the single TK phosphorylation site, Y323. Among functional hK2P family members, genistein also reduced K2P6.1 (TWIK-2), K2P9.1 (TASK-3) and K2P13.1 (THIK-1) currents, respectively.CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Modulation of K2P channels\nUnlike Td-THIK2-THIK2 that is mainly detected in the endoplasmic reticulum, Td-THIK1-THIK2 distributes at the plasma membrane, indicating that THIK1 can mask the endoplasmic reticulum retention/retrieval motif of THIK2. Kinetics and unitary conductance of Td-THIK1-THIK2 are intermediate between THIK1 and THIK2. Altogether, these results show that THIK1 and THIK2 form active heteromeric channels, further expanding the known repertoire of K(+) channels.",

Most members of the AraC/XylS family contain a conserved carboxy-terminal DNA binding domain and a less conserved amino-terminal domain involved in binding small-molecule effectors and dimerization. However, there is no evidence that Rns, a regulator of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli virulence genes, responds to an effector ligand, and in this study we found that the amino-terminal domain of Rns does not form homodimers in vivo. Exposure of Rns to the chemical cross-linker glutaraldehyde revealed that the full-length protein is also a monomer in vitro. Nevertheless, deletion analysis of Rns demonstrated that the first 60 amino acids of the protein are essential for the activation and repression of Rns-regulated promoters in vivo. Amino-terminal truncation of Rns abolished DNA binding in vitro, and two randomly generated mutations, I14T and N16D, that independently abolished Rns autoregulation were isolated. Further analysis of\nin vitro, and two randomly generated mutations, I14T and N16D, that independently abolished Rns autoregulation were isolated. Further analysis of these mutations revealed that they have disparate effects at other Rns-regulated promoters and suggest that they may be involved in an interaction with the carboxy-terminal domain of Rns. Thus, evolution may have preserved the amino terminus of Rns because it is essential for the regulator's activity even though it apparently lacks the two functions, dimerization and ligand binding, usually associated with the amino-terminal domains of AraC/XylS family members. Endocytosis of epidermal growth factor receptor regulated by Grb2-mediated recruitment of the Rab5 GTPase-activating protein RN-tre. The Grb2 adaptor protein is best known for its role in signaling to the small GTPase p21(ras), mediated through its interaction with the SOS guanine nucleotide exchange factor.

Through deletion and site-directed mutagenesis approaches, we identified within the LAE essential sequence motifs required in both leg and antennal tissues. Using genetic and biochemical tests, we establish that in the LAE (i) a key TAAT-rich activator motif interacts with the homeodomain P-D protein Distal-less (Dll) and (ii) a single T-rich activator motif binds the C2H2 zinc-finger P-D protein Rotund (Rn), leading to bab2 up-regulation respectively in all or specifically in the proximal-most ring(s), both in leg and antenna. Joint ectopic expression of Dll and Rn is sufficient to cell-autonomously activate endogenous bab2 and LAE-driven reporter expression in wing and haltere cells. Our findings indicate that accuracy, reliability and robustness of developmental gene expression do not necessarily require cis-regulatory information redundancy.

A fine-tuned spatio-temporal expression of bric-a-brac2 (bab2) along concentric rings is essential for proper proximo-distal (P-D) differentiation of legs and antennae. However, within the genetic interaction landscape governing limb development, no transcription factor directly controlling bab2 expression has been identified to date. Using site-targeted GFP reporter assay and BAC recombineering, we show here that restricted bab2 expression in leg and antennal imaginal discs relies on a single 567-bp-long cis-regulatory module (CRM), termed LAE (for leg and antennal enhancer). We show that this CRM (i) is necessary and sufficient to ensure normal bab2 activity in developing leg and antenna, and (ii) is structurally and functionally conserved among Drosophilidae. Through deletion and site-directed mutagenesis approaches, we identified within the LAE essential sequence\nof the genes in the yeast genome). Among the functions of its targets are: protein folding, degradation, trafficking, cell integrity maintenance, transport, signaling, and transcription. Hsf1 contains DNA binding and trimerization domains and is hyper-phosphorylated in serine and threonine residues in response to heat and oxidative stress, modifications that activate its transcriptional activity. The PKA constitutively represses the activity of Hsf1, thereby inhibiting the expression of small heat shock protein genes. It is documented that, in this regulation, the CS of PKA do not interact directly with Hsf1. Moreover, when the activity of the PKA is low, such as during glucose starvation, Hsf1 is phosphorylated and activated by Yak1 and Rim15 kinases. However, the factors that mediate the regulation of Hsf1 by the PKA in glucose-rich media, and in response to heat shock, are still unknown. In addition to Hsf1, Skn7 also recognizes HSE elements and is part of a\nendocytosis. Strikingly, RN-tre does not block EGF-induced internalization of a Grb2 mutant deficient in RN-tre binding. These results 1) suggest that the ability of RN-tre to inhibit internalization of the EGFR requires Grb2-mediated binding to the receptor and 2) identify Grb2 as a critical regulator of Rab5 and EGFR endocytosis. Complex regulation of Hsf1-Skn7 activities by the catalytic subunits of PKA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: experimental and computational evidences Background The cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory network (PKA-RN) regulates metabolism, memory, learning, development, and response to stress. Previous models of this network considered the catalytic subunits (CS) as a single entity, overlooking their functional individualities. Furthermore, PKA-RN dynamics are often measured through cAMP levels in nutrient-depleted cells shortly after being fed with glucose, dismissing downstream physiological processes.

In support, we show that RN-tre is regulated by cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation peaking at mitosis, which can be antagonized by hCdc14A activity in vitro as well as in vivo. Furthermore, we show that RN-tre phosphorylation is critical for efficient hCdc14A association and that RN-tre binding can be displaced by tungstate, a competitive inhibitor that binds to the active site of hCdc14A. Consistent with the preference of hCdc14A for phosphorylations mediated by proline-directed kinases, we find that RN-tre is a direct substrate of cyclin-dependent kinase. Finally, phosphorylation of RN-tre appears to finely modulate its catalytic activity. Our findings reveal a novel connection between the cell cycle machinery and the endocytic pathway. Drosophila distal-less and Rotund bind a single enhancer ensuring reliable and robust bric-a-brac2 expression in distinct limb morphogenetic fields. Most identified Drosophila appendage-patterning genes encode DNA-binding proteins, whose cross-regulatory interactions remain to be better characterized at the molecular level,\nexchange factor. Here, we demonstrate that Grb2 also signals to Rab5, a small GTPase that plays a key role in early endocytic trafficking. Grb2 functions through association with RN-tre, a GTPase-activating protein for Rab5. Grb2 and RN-tre associate both in vitro and in vivo, with interaction mediated by both SH3 domains of Grb2 and extended proline-rich sequences in RN-tre. Association between Grb2 and RN-tre is constitutive and occurs independently of Eps8, a previously identified binding partner of RN-tre. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates recruitment of RN-tre to the EGF receptor (EGFR) in a Grb2-dependent manner. Grb2 and the EGFR are internalized and co-localized in endocytic vesicles in response to EGF. Overexpression of RN-tre blocks the internalization of both proteins, consistent with its function as a negative regulator of Rab5 and endocytosis. Strikingly, RN-tre does not block EGF-induced internalization of a Grb2 mutant deficient in RN-tre binding. These results 1) suggest\nRegulation of the Rab5 GTPase-activating protein RN-tre by the dual specificity phosphatase Cdc14A in human cells. The Cdc14 family of dual specificity phosphatases regulates key mitotic events in the eukaryotic cell cycle. Although extensively characterized in yeast, little is known about the function of mammalian Cdc14 family members. Here we report a genetic substrate-trapping system designed to identify substrates of the human Cdc14A (hCdc14A) phosphatase. Using this approach, we identify RN-tre, a GTPase-activating protein for the Rab5 GTPase, as a novel physiological target of hCdc14A. As a Rab5 GTPase-activating protein, RN-tre has previously been implicated in control of intracellular membrane trafficking. We find that RN-tre forms a stable complex with the catalytically inactive hCdc14A C278S mutant but not with the wild type protein in human cells, indicative of a substrate/enzyme interaction. In support, we show that RN-tre is regulated by cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation peaking at mitosis, which can be antagonized\nmutants with decreased Hsp70 levels increase the expression of Hsps, enhance thermotolerance, and grow slowly. Additionally, these phenotypes are suppressed by a mutation in HSF1 that decreases its DNA binding affinity. These observations and others from both mammals and yeast reinforce a model that includes an auto-regulatory loop in which Hsp70 represses Hsf1 activity. Moreover, Ssa1 positively controls the PKA-RN by stabilizing Cdc25 at optimal temperatures and, under stress, the Cdc25-Hsp70 complex dissociates leading to a loss of Cdc25 levels and a decrease in the activity of the PKA pathway. Our experiments revealed that deletion of SSA2 increased HSE-dependent gene expression (Fig. 6). Deletion of SSA1 did not affect HSE-dependent gene expression significantly, indicating that SSA2 suffices for maintaining WT activity. Deletion of both SSA1 and SSA2 largely increased the reporter activity, uncovering the contribution of both Hsp70 genes as repressors of HSE-dependent gene expression in WT cells. Interestingly, deletion\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae Complex interactions among members of an essential subfamily of hsp70 genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Deterministic mathematical models of the cAMP pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Heat shock transcription factors: structure and regulation Identifying gene regulatory modules of heat shock response in yeast Repression of heat shock transcription factor HSF1 activation by HSP90 (HSP90 complex) that forms a stress-sensitive complex with HSF1 Identification and structure of the anti-sigma factor-binding domain of the disulphide-stress regulated sigma factor sigma(R) from Streptomyces coelicolor. The extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor sigma(R) is a global regulator of redox homeostasis in the antibiotic-producing bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor, with a similar role in other actinomycetes such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Normally maintained in an inactive state by its bound anti-sigma factor RsrA, sigma(R) dissociates in response to intracellular disulphide-stress to direct core RNA polymerase to transcribe genes, such as trxBA and trxC that encode the enzymes of the thioredoxin\nwere taken before and immediately after the 50 \u00b0C treatment, and dilutions were plated on solid YPD to measure cell viability by colony counting.

Genetic techniques and nucleic acid manipulations DNA manipulations and genetic techniques were performed according to Sambrook, Fritsch & Maniatis and Guthrie & Fink, respectively. DNA sequencing was performed at the Unit for DNA Synthesis and Sequencing of the Instituto de Biotecnolog\u00eda. Yeast transformation was performed following the method\nto direct core RNA polymerase to transcribe genes, such as trxBA and trxC that encode the enzymes of the thioredoxin disulphide reductase pathway, that re-establish redox homeostasis. Little is known about where RsrA binds on sigma(R) or how it suppresses sigma(R)-dependent transcriptional activity. Using a combination of proteolysis, surface-enhanced laser desorption ionisation mass spectrometry and pull-down assays we identify an N-terminal, approximately 10kDa domain (sigma(RN)) that encompasses region 2 of sigma(R) that represents the major RsrA binding site. We show that sigma(RN) inhibits transcription by an unrelated sigma factor and that this inhibition is relieved by RsrA binding, reaffirming that region 2 is involved in binding to core RNA polymerase but also demonstrating that the likely mechanism by which RsrA inhibits sigma(R) activity is by blocking this association. We also report the 2.4A resolution crystal structure of sigma(RN) that reveals extensive structural conservation with the equivalent region of sigma(70) from\nthe Rim15 protein kinase. However, acclimation to high temperatures during the exponential phase requires the concerted action of Hsf1 and Msn2/Msn4 transcription factors, and chromatin remodeling complexes such as SWI/SNF. These factors allow the rapid transcription of genes encoding stress proteins involved in prevention and repair of damages caused by stress. Hsf1 transcription factor is encoded by a single gene and shows high affinity for the heat shock elements (HSE), found in the promoters of the heat shock genes. The essentiality of Hsf1 indicates that \u2014 besides being important for the response to carbon starvation as well as heat, osmotic, and oxidative stress \u2014 it also plays important functions in normal growth. The widespread functions regulated by Hsf1 explain its binding to a large number of promoters (about 3 % of the genes in the yeast genome). Among the functions of its targets are: protein folding, degradation, trafficking, cell integrity\nHsp70s, reducing their positive interaction over Cdc25 and the inhibition of Hsf1. Therefore, heat shock (HS) was introduced into the model as a node of the PKA-RN that affects the functional state of Ssa1 and Ssa2. Its logical function corresponds to a positive auto regulation (see Additional file 3: Supplementary Information, Section 3). This means that whenever this node is active (which corresponds to the 39 \u00b0C condition), it remained active all the time. By contrast, the 25 \u00b0C condition is represented by inactivating the HS node and keeping it inactivated throughout the simulation time.

Background The cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) regulatory network (PKA-RN) is found in protozoa, animals, algae, and fungi. It plays a central role in the control of different inter- and intra- cellular processes such as metabolism, cell proliferation, stress response, and development. In yeast, the PKA-RN is also involved in the control of growth in response to nutrient conditions, which in turn are known to influence the stress response. In S. cerevisiae, the PKA holoenzyme forms an inactive tetramer composed of two regulatory subunits (2 x Bcy1) and two out of three CS (Tpk1, Tpk2, or Tpk3). When intracellular concentrations of cAMP increase, Bcy1 binds cAMP, promoting the activation by",

STIM1 activation of adenylyl cyclase 6 connects Ca2+ and cAMP signaling during melanogenesis. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-plasma membrane (PM) junctions form functionally active microdomains that connect intracellular and extracellular environments. While the key role of these interfaces in maintenance of intracellular Ca2+ levels has been uncovered in recent years, the functional significance of ER-PM junctions in non-excitable cells has remained unclear.

PYG activation required stimulation of both exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 2 (EPAC2) and RAP1 via RAS and ADCY6 phosphorylation, with the latter being mediated by Raf-1 proto-oncogene, Ser/Thr kinase (RAF1). Consistent with this model, PYG activation was EGFR-dependent and may be initiated by the constitutively active form of RAS. Consequently, PYG activation in Kit 225 T cells could be blocked with specific inhibitors of RAS, EPAC, RAP1, RAF1, ADCY6, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Our results establish a new paradigm for the mechanism of PYG activation, which depends on the type of receptor involved.

A homozygous missense mutation in adenylate cyclase 6 gene (ADCY6) was found in another family characterized by a lack of myelin in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) as determined by TEM. Morpholino knockdown of the zebrafish orthologs led to severe and specific defects in peripheral myelin in spite of the presence of Schwann cells. ADCY6 encodes a protein that belongs to the adenylate cyclase family responsible for the synthesis of cAMP. Elevation of cAMP can mimic axonal contact in vitro and upregulates myelinating signals. Our data indicate an essential and so far unknown role of ADCY6 in PNS myelination likely through the cAMP pathway. Mutations of genes encoding proteins of Ranvier domains or involved in myelination of Schwann cells are responsible for novel and severe human axoglial diseases.\nand real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were used to study the interaction between Pur\u03b2 and the Adcy6 promoter.RESULTS: Pur\u03b2 was abnormally elevated in obese mice and was also increased under fasting conditions or via the glucagon signaling pathway, which promoted HGP by increasing Adcy6 expression. Liver-specific knockdown of Pur\u03b2 in db/db mice significantly ameliorated hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance by suppressing the glucagon/ADCY6/cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway. Consistent with this observation, the knockdown of Pur\u03b2 also inhibited glucose production in isolated primary hepatocytes by inhibiting the glucagon/ADCY6/cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway, whereas the overexpression of Pur\u03b2 promoted glucose production by activating this signaling pathway. Mechanistically, Pur\u03b2 directly binds to the promoter of the Adcy6 gene and thereby promotes its transcription.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results illustrate a new model in which Pur\u03b2 functions to regulate the glucagon/ADCY6/cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway to help maintain glucose homeostasis. STIM1 activation of adenylyl cyclase 6\nsuch as helicase with zinc finger 2 (HELZ2), nuclear receptor coactivator 3 (NCOA3), and mediator complex subunit 30 (MED30). Thereinto, HELZ2 was ego gene with hub nodes. Discussion In this study, an ego network was given, which selected subnetworks for predicting genes related to anxiety and nociceptive sensitivity. The main advantage of ego network was to screen potential genes that were not differentially expressed but with important functions by interacting with differentially expressed genes. Based on this method, a total of 11 modules including ego genes and potential genes were identified. Thereinto, module 3 was with highest accuracy, and genes in this module were G protein subunit alpha I1 (GNAI1), DRD2, prepronociceptin (PNOC), and adenylate cyclase 7 (ADCY7). GNAI1 was the ego gene in this module. Similarly, module 36 included genes of C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), DRD2, PNOC, and lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPAR1). CCR2 was the ego\nG-protein-coupled receptor activity. F\u0131nd\u0131kl\u0131 et al. demonstrated that G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 level in serum could be used as an independent predictor for anxiety. In this study, PNOC and DRD2 were found to be with closely relationship (weight = 0.4838). This gene encoded a protein which could generate various protein products, including nociception, nocistatin, and orphanin FQ2. It is widely known that orphanin FQ2 could bind to the nociception receptor and further increase pain sensitivity. Diseases associated with PNOC included neonatal abstinence syndrome and pain agnosia. Thereby, GNAI1, DRD2, and PNOC in module 3 were closely related with anxiety and nociceptive sensitivity. Furthermore, CCR2 encoded two isoforms of a receptor for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, a chemokine which specially mediates monocyte chemotaxis. This protein was associated with monocyte infiltration and inflammatory response. In addition, the receptors of CCR2 mediate agonist-dependent calcium mobilization and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase.

In addition, the receptors of CCR2 mediate agonist-dependent calcium mobilization and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. As shown in previous studies, diabetes might induce changes of calcium mobilization in nociceptive neurons. In addition, the recovery of Ca2+ and Mg2+ could regulate the endoplasmic reticulum and plasmalemma and further affect spinal dorsal horn and dorsal root ganglia neurons. Gover et al. also confirmed that external and internal Ca2+ could alter the pattern of discharge and affect the excitability of sensory neurons. In this study, DRD2 and CCR2 were found to be with association (weight = 0.2327). This gene encodes the D2 subtype of the dopamine receptor. This G-protein-coupled receptor inhibited adenylyl cyclase activity. Mutation in this gene causes myoclonus dystonia and schizophrenia. In mouse model, deficiency in D3 dopamine receptor was confirmed to reduce anxiety. Moreover, chronic deficiency of dopamine receptor D3 might induce depressed spirit and even anxiety. Interestingly, de\ninteraction network. One-side t test was used to calculate the p value of each gene between samples with and without SINE. Then, the weight of each interaction in PPI was calculated by the following formula: Thereinto, V represents the set of nodes. Ego genes identification Topological analysis was processed for PPI network, and genes in this network were ranked based on their degrees. Every network (Gk = (V,Ek) (1 \u2264 k \u2264 M)) had an adjacency matrix (AK = (aijk) n \u00d7 n). The importance of each genes for the network was calculated by the following formula which is shown by g(i) value (g(i) = z-score): Thereinto, Nk(i) was the adjacency node of Gk, and k was the degree normalized weighted adjacency matrix. In addition, k = D\u22121/2AkD1/2, D was the diagonal matrix of Ak. Then, nodes in PPI were ranked based on the z-score. The top 5% genes with\nDRD2, PNOC, ADCY7, NPY, LPAR1, NR4A2, RGS7, RARG, NR1D1, PLCB1, IPMK DRD4 0 Subnetwork for anxiety and nociceptive sensitivity. Note: The nodes represent important genes for anxiety and nociceptive sensitivity, and edges represent their relationships between these genes. The blue and yellow genes represent normal and ego genes, respectively. After module searching and refinement, a total of 11 candidate modules were obtained, including module 14 (accuracy = 0.8), module 51 (accuracy =0.85), and module 9 (accuracy = 0.8). In addition, these 11 modules were confirmed to be with significance. As shown in Table 1 and Figure 2, module 14 contained 10 genes, such as histamine receptor H3 (HRH3), dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2), and C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3). CXCR3 was an ego gene. Similarly, module 51 included six genes, such as helicase with zinc finger 2 (HELZ2), nuclear receptor coactivator 3 (NCOA3), and mediator complex subunit 30 (MED30). Thereinto,\ngenes of C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), DRD2, PNOC, and lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPAR1). CCR2 was the ego gene in this module. Besides, we identified ADCY2 and ADCY6 to be the top five ego genes that are related to anxiety and nociceptive sensitivity. These genes are members of the family of ADCYs, which are membrane-associated enzymes that catalyze the formation of the secondary messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Chen et al. built a mice model and found that ADCY5 was significantly highly expressed in striatum. In addition, the deletion of ADCY1 in mice clearly reduced nociceptive behaviors and chronic pain-induced anxiety. Previous studies also confirmed that ADCY1 contributed chronic pain-induced long-term synaptic plasticity in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice. Moreover, the polymorphism in 3\u2032 untranslated region of ADCY7 was confirmed to be closely related with the risk of anxiety, especially in males. Therefore, ADCYs were closely related with\ndiagnosis and therapeutic intervention. Pur\u03b2 promotes hepatic glucose production by increasing Adcy6 transcription. OBJECTIVE: Enhanced glucagon signaling and hepatic glucose production (HGP) can account for hyperglycemia in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the enhanced HGP in these patients are not fully understood. Here, we identify Pur\u03b2 as a positive regulator of HGP and study its molecular mechanisms in the regulation of HGP both in vivo and in vitro.METHODS: Adenovirus-mediated knockdown or overexpression of Pur\u03b2 was performed in either primary hepatocytes or the livers of db/db mice. Glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and HGP were determined by glucose, insulin, and lactate tolerance tests, respectively. Pur\u03b2/ADCY6 protein levels, glucagon signaling (p-CREB/CREB), and insulin signaling (p-Akt/Akt) were measured by immunoblotting. Gene expression was measured by RNA-seq and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were used to study the interaction between Pur\u03b2\nwas confirmed to be closely related with the risk of anxiety, especially in males. Therefore, ADCYs were closely related with anxiety and nociceptive sensitivity. GNAI1 was a heterotrimeric signal-transducing molecule consisting of alpha, beta, and gamma subnits. The alpha subunit binds guanine nucleotide, could hydrolyze GTP, and also interacts with other proteins. GNAI1 was commonly enriched in GTP binding, signal transducer activity, and peptide ligand-binding receptors. In rat models, both JTC-801 and Ro64-6198 were confirmed to affect GTP\u03b3S binding in brain and to further monitor the anxiety and nociceptive sensitivity. In addition, mice with deficiency in corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 was found to be with lower anxiety sensitivity. Similarly with GNAI1, DRD2 was also mainly enriched in signal transducer activity and peptide ligand-binding receptors. Besides, it was also enriched in G-protein-coupled receptor activity. F\u0131nd\u0131kl\u0131 et al. demonstrated that G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 level in serum could be used as an\nproteomic strategies for understanding alcohol action Significance of Thr182 in the nucleotide-exchange and GTP-hydrolysis reactions of the alpha subunit of GTP-binding protein Gi2 Nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide receptor antagonist JTC-801 reverses pain and anxiety symptoms in a rat model of post-traumatic stress disorder Distribution of nociceptin and Ro64-6198 activated [35S]-GTPgammaS binding in the rat brain Serum levels of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) in drug-naive patients with generalized anxiety disorder Nocistatin and prepro-nociceptin/orphanin FQ 160-187 cause nociception through activation of Gi/o in capsaicin-sensitive and of Gs in capsaicin-insensitive nociceptors, respectively Increased nociceptive sensitivity and nociceptin/orphanin FQ levels in a rat model of PTSD Differential expression of the isoforms for the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 receptor, CCR2, in monocytes Diabetes-induced abnormalities in ER calcium mobilization in primary and secondary nociceptive neurons Role of Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPases in diabetes-induced alterations in calcium homeostasis in input neurons of the nociceptive system D3 dopamine receptor-deficient mouse:\nof classification accuracy not less than 0.8. The selected modules were obtained as candidate ego modules. Statistical analysis of ego networks A total of 1000 randomized tests were processed for ego networks. The classification accuracy of each ego network was obtained in this process. The p value of each ego network was calculated by the following formula: p = SUM possibility (randomized classification accuracy > candidate classification accuracy)/number of randomized tests. Ego network with p \u2264 0.05 was regarded with significance. Results PPI identification The interactions with genes in gene expression profiles were extracted, and PPI was constructed. The PPI included 4639 genes and 43,837 relationships. Ego genes identification Differential co-expression network. Note: The nodes represent important genes for anxiety and nociceptive sensitivity, and edges represent their relationships between these genes. The blue and yellow genes represent normal and ego genes, respectively. Differential co-expression network was constructed (Figure 1). Based\nthe diagonal matrix of Ak. Then, nodes in PPI were ranked based on the z-score. The top 5% genes with higher degree and genes with degree more than 1 were chosen as ego genes. Module searching for ego genes and refinement A known ego gene v \u2208 V was used as a differently expressed module. Then, gene U which was adjacent to v was added in this model, and new model C\u2032 was obtained. The variation of classification accuracy between module V and C\u2032 was calculated by formula of \u0394S(C\u2032,C) = S(C\u2032)\u2212S(C). Gene U increased the degree of module C when \u0394S(C\u2032,C) was more than 0. Following, all genes with \u0394S(C\u2032,C) > 0 was added in module C, until \u0394S was not increased. All modules were refined with the threshold of classification accuracy not less than 0.8. The selected modules were obtained as candidate ego modules. Statistical analysis of ego\nmodules such as module 3 and module 36 were important subnetworks. Potential genes in these modules including ADCYs, GNAI1, DRD2, PNOC, CCR2, DRD2, and LPAR1 might be important genes in the research of anxiety and nociceptive sensitivity.

We found high Tmem43 levels among BXDs with broad variability in expression. Expression of Tmem43 highly negatively correlated with heart mass and heart rate among BXDs, whereas levels of Tmem43 highly positively correlated with plasma high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Through finding differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between Tmem43S358L mutant and wild-type (Tmem43WT) lines, 18 pathways (out of 42 found in BXDs GRP) that are involved in ARVC, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease were verified. We further constructed Tmem43-mediated gene network, in which Ctnna1, Adcy6, Gnas, Ndufs6, and Uqcrc2 were significantly altered in Tmem43S358L mice versus Tmem43WT controls. Our study defined the importance of Tmem43 for cardiac- and metabolism-related pathways, suggesting that cardiovascular disease-relevant risk factors may also increase risk of metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases via TMEM43-mediated pathways. Mutations in CNTNAP1 and ADCY6 are responsible for severe arthrogryposis\nthe normal, and fibromyalgia with Val128Met SNP also showed higher sensitivity to pressure. These data are certainly valued, but differently expressed genes based on expression data were still without higher reliability. Normal bioinformatics always focus on individual genetic index, which could not comprehensively describe the character of network. In this study, a novel method of ego network analysis was used to identify significant networks associated with anxiety and nociceptive sensitivity, and accuracy was applied to predict key genes and their relationships for anxiety and nociceptive sensitivity related to Comt1 genetype. Materials and methods Data source and pretreatment The raw data of E-GEOD-20160 were obtained from ArrayExpress database, which was related to anxiety and nociceptive sensitivity.

Tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor antagonist used in the treatment of breast cancer, inhibits the inward rectifier potassium current (I(K1)) in cardiac myocytes by an unknown mechanism. We characterized the inhibitory effects of tamoxifen on Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3 potassium channels that underlie cardiac I(K1). We also studied the effects of 4-hydroxytamoxifen and raloxifene. All three drugs inhibited inward rectifier K(+) 2.x (Kir2.x) family members. The order of inhibition for all three drugs was Kir2.3 > Kir2.1 approximately Kir2.2. The onset of inhibition of Kir2.x current by these compounds was slow (T(1/2) approximately 6 min) and only partially recovered after washout ( approximately 30%). Kir2.x inhibition was concentration-dependent but voltage-independent. The time course and degree of inhibition was independent of external\nand interference in PIP2 interaction with Kir2.x and Kir6.2 channels. Cardiac inward rectifier potassium currents determine the resting membrane potential and contribute repolarization capacity during phase 3 repolarization. Quinacrine is a cationic amphiphilic drug. In this work, the effects of quinacrine were studied on cardiac Kir channels expressed in HEK 293 cells and on the inward rectifier potassium currents, I(K1) and I(KATP), in cardiac myocytes. We found that quinacrine differentially inhibited Kir channels, Kir6.2 \u223c Kir2.3 > Kir2.1. In addition, we found in cardiac myocytes that quinacrine inhibited I(KATP) > I(K1). We presented evidence that quinacrine displays a double action towards strong inward rectifier Kir2.x channels, i.e., direct pore block and interference in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, PIP(2)-Kir channel interaction. Pore block is evident in Kir2.1 and 2.3 channels as rapid block; channel block involves residues E224 and E299 facing the cytoplasmic pore of Kir2.1.

Finally, using patch-clamp analysis, we validate the functional relevance of PKP4, one of our top BioID interactors, to the modulation of Kir2.1-controlled inward rectifier potassium currents. Our results validate the power of our BioID approach in identifying functionally relevant Kir2.1 interactors and underline the value of our Kir2.1 interactome as a repository for numerous novel biological hypotheses on Kir2.1 and Kir2.1-associated diseases.

The interference of the drug with the interaction of Kir2.x and Kir6.2/SUR2A channels and PIP(2) is suggested from four sources of evidence: (1) Slow onset of current block when quinacrine is applied from either the inside or the outside of the channel. (2) Mutation of Kir2.3(I213L) and mutation of Kir6.2(C166S) increase their affinity for PIP(2) and lowers its sensitivity for quinacrine. (3) Mutations of Kir2.1(L222I and K182Q) which decreased its affinity for PIP(2) increased its sensitivity for quinacrine. (4) Co-application of quinacrine with PIP(2) lowers quinacrine-mediated current inhibition. In conclusion, our data demonstrate how an old drug provides insight into a dual a blocking mechanism of Kir carried inward rectifier channels. IRK-1 potassium channels mediate peptidergic inhibition of C. elegans serotonin neurons via a Go signaling pathway To identify molecular mechanisms that function in G protein signaling,\nKir2.x channels produced both homomeric and heteromeric dominant-negative effects. (v) Kir2.1 and Kir2.3 channels could be coimmunoprecipitated in membrane extracts from isolated guinea pig cardiomyocytes. (vi) Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed interaction between the N- and C-terminal intracellular domains of different Kir2.x subunits. Coexpression of Kir2.1 mutants related to Andersen's syndrome with wild-type Kir2.x channels showed a dominant negative effect, the extent of which varied between different mutants. Our results suggest that differential tetramerization of the mutant allele of Kir2.1 with wild-type Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3 channels represents the molecular basis of the extraordinary pleiotropy of Andersen's syndrome. Kir2.1 Interactome Mapping Uncovers PKP4 as a Modulator of the Kir2.1-Regulated Inward Rectifier Potassium Currents. Kir2.1, a strong inward rectifier potassium channel encoded by the KCNJ2 gene, is a key regulator of the resting membrane potential of the cardiomyocyte and plays an important role in controlling ventricular excitation and action potential duration in\npresent evidence indicates current downregulation and modulation of IKATP seems less promising than that of other inward rectifiers. Multi-ion distributions in the cytoplasmic domain of inward rectifier potassium channels. Inward rectifier potassium (Kir) channels act as cellular diodes, allowing unrestricted flow of potassium (K(+)) into the cell while preventing currents of large magnitude in the outward direction. The rectification mechanism by which this occurs involves a coupling between K(+) and intracellular blockers-magnesium (Mg(2+)) or polyamines-that simultaneously occupy the permeation pathway. In addition to the transmembrane pore, Kirs possess a large cytoplasmic domain (CD) that provides a favorable electronegative environment for cations. Electrophysiological experiments have shown that the CD is a key regulator of both conductance and rectification. In this study, we calculate and compare averaged equilibrium probability densities of K(+) and Cl(-) in open-pore models of the CDs of a weak (Kir1.1-ROMK) and a strong (Kir2.1-IRK) rectifier through explicit-solvent molecular-dynamics\nKAB-2 are characterized with a Walker type-A ATP-binding motif in their carboxyl termini, and may be involved in K+ transport in renal epithelial and brain glial cells. uKATP-1 and BIR form with sulfonylurea receptors, the so-called ATP-sensitive K+ channels. Thus, it is a feature of the Kir channel family that each subfamily plays a specific physiological functional role. The (Na+)-activated Kir channels identified electrophysiologically in neurons and cardiac myocytes have not yet been cloned. In this review, we overviewed the current understandings of the features of the molecular structures and functions of the four main subfamilies of Kir channels. Heteromerization of Kir2.x potassium channels contributes to the phenotype of Andersen's syndrome. Andersen's syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder related to mutations of the potassium channel Kir2.1, is characterized by cardiac arrhythmias, periodic paralysis, and dysmorphic bone structure. The aim of our study was to find out whether heteromerization of Kir2.1 channels\nInward rectifier potassium currents as a target for atrial fibrillation therapy. Subunits of inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir) are expressed in many different tissues of the human body. Inward rectifier currents expressed in the heart are constituted by pore-forming alpha-subunits of Kir2, Kir3, and Kir6 subfamilies. Characteristic properties of inward rectifiers comprise small outward conductances that nevertheless are important to terminal repolarization of cardiac action potentials. There is considerable difference in the regional expression of cardiac Kir channels, and subunits are additionally regulated by specific disease conditions. Resulting changes facilitate occurrence and persistence of atrial fibrillation (AF). For instance, upregulation of Kir2.1 protein and resultant current I K1 is a hallmark of AF-related ionic remodeling. Increased I K1 helps to stabilize atrial rotors, and current inhibition has accordingly been suggested as an antiarrhythmic approach for AF therapy. But there are caveats to I K1 inhibition per se, and there is\nresting membrane potential of the cardiomyocyte and plays an important role in controlling ventricular excitation and action potential duration in the human heart. Mutations in KCNJ2 result in inheritable cardiac diseases in humans, e.g. the type-1 Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS1). Understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern the regulation of inward rectifier potassium currents by Kir2.1 in both normal and disease contexts should help uncover novel targets for therapeutic intervention in ATS1 and other Kir2.1-associated channelopathies. The information available to date on protein-protein interactions involving Kir2.1 channels remains limited. Additional efforts are necessary to provide a comprehensive map of the Kir2.1 interactome. Here we describe the generation of a comprehensive map of the Kir2.1 interactome using the proximity-labeling approach BioID. Most of the 218 high-confidence Kir2.1 channel interactions we identified are novel and encompass various molecular mechanisms of Kir2.1 function, ranging from intracellular trafficking to cross-talk with the insulin-like growth factor receptor\nthat are strongly, but not completely, inwardly rectified. IRK-1 channels have detectable constitutive activity when overexpressed in Xenopus oocytes, as do other members of the Kcnj channel family. Go signaling and IRK-1 channels regulate the excitability of the HSN neurons In vertebrates, inward rectifier potassium channels regulate the excitability of neurons e.g.. Because of the strong genetic interaction between irk 1 and egl-6, we hypothesized that EGL-6 signaling inhibits the excitability of HSN neurons in a manner that depends on IRK-1 channels. To test this hypothesis, we generated transgenic animals that express ChR2 using the egl-6 promoter. This transgene allowed us to deliver defined excitatory stimuli to the HSNs. The egl-6 promoter drives transgene expression in a small number of cells including the HSNs. To ensure that behavioral responses to photostimulation could be attributed to activation of the HSN neurons, we used structured illumination to functionally map the site of\nperiodic paralysis, and dysmorphic bone structure. The aim of our study was to find out whether heteromerization of Kir2.1 channels with wild-type Kir2.2 and Kir2.3 channels contributes to the phenotype of Andersen's syndrome. The following results show that Kir2.x channels can form functional heteromers: (i) HEK293 cells transfected with Kir2.x-Kir2.y concatemers expressed inwardly rectifying K(+) channels with a conductance of 28-30 pS. (ii) Expression of Kir2.x-Kir2.y concatemers in Xenopus oocytes produced inwardly rectifying, Ba(2+) sensitive currents. (iii) When Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 channels were coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes the IC(50) for Ba(2+) block of the inward rectifier current differed substantially from the value expected for independent expression of homomeric channels. (iv) Coexpression of nonfunctional Kir2.x constructs, in which the GYG region of the pore region was replaced by AAA, with wild-type Kir2.x channels produced both homomeric and heteromeric dominant-negative effects. (v) Kir2.1 and Kir2.3 channels could be coimmunoprecipitated in membrane extracts\nand in the secretion and absorption of K+ ions across cell membrane. Recent molecular biological dissection has shown that the DNAs encoding Kir channels constitute a new family of K+ channels whose subunits contain two putative transmembrane domains and a pore-forming region. So far, more than ten cDNAs of Kir channel subunits have been isolated and classified into four subfamilies: 1) IRK subfamily (IRK1-3/Kir1.1-1.3), 2) GIRK subfamily (GIRK1-4/Kir3.1-3.4), 3) ATP-dependent Kir subfamily (ROMK1/Kir1.1, K(AB)-2/Kir4.1), and 4) ATP-sensitive Kir subfamily (uKATP-1/Kir6.1, BIR/Kir6.2). Xenopus oocytes injected with the cRNAs of IRKs elicit classical Kir channel currents. GIRKs, as heteromultimers, compose the G protein-gated Kir (KG) channels, which are regulated by a variety of Gi/Go-coupled inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors such as m2-mus-carinic, serotonergic (5HT1A), GABAB, somatostatin and opioid (mu, delta, kappa) receptors. ROMK1 and KAB-2 are characterized with a Walker type-A ATP-binding motif in their carboxyl termini, and may be involved in K+ transport\nIndeed, sequences required for regulation by G proteins of mammalian inward-rectifier potassium channels are conserved between those channels and IRK-1 (Fig. 3b), suggesting that IRK-1 channels might be directly targeted by G proteins. The failure of irk-1 to enhance suppression of the Egl-6(gf) phenotype by goa-1 suggests that irk-1 and goa-1 function in a common pathway. We tested whether irk-1 mutants have other behavioral defects in common with goa-1 mutants. In addition to hyperactive egg-laying behavior, goa-1 mutants also display hyperactive locomotory behavior. We compared the locomotory behavior of irk-1 mutants to that of goa-1 mutants and found that irk-1 mutants did not display the hyperactivity characteristic of goa-1 mutants (Fig. 3c). The role of irk-1 in Go signaling, therefore, seems to be specific to the egg-laying system of C. elegans. IRK-1 forms homomeric inwardly rectified K+ channels We identified C. elegans IRK channels as candidate effectors of EGL-6 signaling\nfor Go inhibition of locomotory behavior.

The activity of the HSNs is regulated by the Go-coupled receptor EGL-6, which mediates inhibition of the HSNs by neuropeptides. We report here that this inhibition requires one of three inwardly rectifying K+ channels encoded by the C. elegans genome: IRK-1. Using ChannelRhodopsin2-mediated stimulation of HSNs, we observed roles for egl-6 and irk-1 in regulating the excitability of HSNs. Although irk 1 is required for inhibition of HSNs by EGL-6 signaling, we found that other Go signaling pathways that inhibit HSNs involve irk-1 little or not at all. These findings suggest that the neuropeptide receptor EGL-6 regulates the potassium channel IRK 1\nof egl-6(gf) mutants. In the mammalian nervous system, inhibitory GPCRs regulate potassium channels of the Kcnj family, which are inwardly rectified tetrameric potassium channels comprising subunits with two transmembrane domains flanking a pore-forming loop. The C. elegans genome is predicted to encode three such channel subunits: IRK-1, IRK-2 and IRK-3 (Fig. 1a). To determine whether any of these channels is required for inhibitory EGL-6 signaling, we isolated deletion alleles of each irk gene (Fig. 1b) and tested whether loss of IRK channels suppressed the egg-laying defect caused by egl-6(gf). We measured the egg-laying behavior of the wild type, egl-6(gf) and egl-6(gf) irk double mutants by scoring the developmental stage of newly laid eggs, which reflects the time embryos spent in utero before being released. As expected, embryos laid by egl 6(gf) mutants were abnormally late-stage, having developed to the three-fold stage and in some cases having already hatched by the",

Mutations in potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily D member 3 (KCND3), encoding the K+ channel, Kv4.3, are associated with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 19, allelic with SCA22. Mutations in potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily C member 3 (KCNC3), encoding another K+ channel, Kv3.3, cause SCA13. First, a comprehensive phenotype assessment was carried out in a family with autosomal dominant ataxia harboring 2 genetic variants in KCNC3 and KCND3. To evaluate the physiological impact of these variants on channel currents, in vitro studies were performed.METHODS: Clinical and psychometric evaluations, neuroimaging, and genotyping of a family (mother and son) affected by ataxia were carried out. Heterozygous and homozygous Kv3.3 A671V and Kv4.3 V374A variants were evaluated in Xenopus laevis oocytes using 2-electrode voltage-clamp.

Introduction Spinocerebellar ataxia type 19/22 (SCA19/22) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative, clinically heterogeneous disorder caused by mutations in KCND3, which encodes the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv4.3. Currently, all the SCA19/22 mutations that have been reported lead to a loss of Kv4.3 current amplitude in studies focused on single mutant Kv4.3 subunits. Functional Kv4.3 subunits are assembled as tetrameric complexes and controlled by a large variety of regulatory auxiliary proteins, including KChIPs (potassium channel interacting proteins), which interact with the tetrameric channels to form octomeric complexes, thereby regulating the expression and subcellular localization of the functional subunits (Kv4) and modifying their intrinsic properties. Kv4.3 channels exhibit fast activation and inactivation in response to membrane depolarization and recover faster from inactivation than other voltage-gated potassium channels, thus playing an important role in the generation of neuronal transient A-type potassium currents in brain (I A), heart and smooth muscle.

Moreover, BrS and SCA19/22 KCND3 variants associated with a gain of function of Ito, significantly reduced INa, whereas the SCA19/22 KCND3 variants associated with a loss of function (LOF) of Ito significantly increased INa. Auxiliary subunits Nav\u03b21, MiRP3 and KChIP2 also modulated INa/Ito balance. Co-immunoprecipitation and Duolink studies suggested that the two channels interact within the intracellular compartments and biotinylation showed that LOF SCN5A variants can increase Kv4.3 cell-surface expression.CONCLUSION: Nav and Kv4.3 channels modulate each other's function via trafficking and gating mechanisms, which have important implications for improved understanding of these allelic cardiac and neuronal syndromes. Modulation of the voltage-gated potassium channel (Kv4.3) and the auxiliary protein (KChIP3) interactions by the current activator NS5806. KChIP3 (potassium channel interacting protein 3) is a calcium-binding protein that binds at the N terminus of the Kv4 voltage-gated potassium channel through interactions at two contact sites and has been shown to regulate\nthe most common arrhythmia in the clinic. While previous studies have identified AF-associated mutations in several genes, the genetic basis for AF remains unclear. Here, we identified a novel T361S missense mutation in potassium voltage-gated channel, shal-related subfamily, member 3 (KCND3) from a Chinese Han family ancestor with lone AF. The wild-type (WT) or mutant T361S of Kv4.3 protein (encoded by KCND3) were co-expressed with the auxiliary subunit K+ channel-Interacting Protein (KChIP2) in HEK293 cells, and transient outward potassium current (Ito) were recorded using patch-clamp methods, and the surface or total protein levels of Kv4.3 were analyzed by western blot. Ito density, measured at 60 mV, for T361S was significantly higher than that for WT. Both the steady-state activation and inactivation curves showed a remarkable hyperpolarizing shift in T361S. Moreover, recovery from inactivation after a 500-ms depolarizing pulse was significantly delayed for T361S compared with that for WT.

Mutation of Tyr-174 or Phe-218 on KChIP3 abolished the enhancement of Kv4.3 site 1 binding in the apo-state, highlighting the role of these residues in drug and K4.3 binding. Kinetic studies show that NS5806 decreases the rate of dissociation between KChIP3 and the N terminus of KV4.3. Overall, these studies support the idea that NS5806 directly interacts with KChIP3 and modulates the interactions between this calcium-binding protein and the T1 domain of the Kv4.3 channels through reorientation of helix 10 on KChIP3. Structural and functional characterization of Kv6.2 a new gamma-subunit of voltage-gated potassium channel. We have cloned and functionally expressed Kv6.2, a new member of the Kv6 subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channel subunits. The human Kv6.2 (KCNF2) gene was mapped at 18q22-18q23. Kv6.2 mRNA is preferentially expressed in rat and human myocard.

In the experiments with KCND3, which encodes Kv4.3, I(to) was significantly increased for both KCNE5 variants compared to wild type. In contrast, there were no significant changes in current properties reconstructed by KCNQ1+ wild type KCNE5 and the 2 variants. With the simulation model, both variants demonstrated notch-and-dome or loss-of-dome patterns.CONCLUSIONS: KCNE5 modulates I(to), and its novel variants appeared to cause IVF, especially BrS, in male patients through gain-of-function effects on I(to). Screening for KCNE5 variants is relevant for BrS or IVF. In silico investigation of the interaction between the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv4.3 and its auxiliary protein KChIP1. The voltage-gated potassium channel Kv4.3 plays a vital role in shaping the timing, frequency, and backpropagation of electrical signals in the brain and heart by generating fast transient currents at subthreshold membrane potentials in repetitive firing neurons. To achieve its\nwe constructed Markov models of Kv4.3 and Kv4.1 activation gating in the presence of HpTx2. Both models feature a series of voltage-dependent steps leading to a final voltage-independent transition to the open state and closely replicate the experimental data. Interaction with HpTx2 increases the energy barrier for channel opening by slowing activation and accelerating deactivation. The greater degree of voltage-dependence in Kv4.3 occurs because it is the voltage-dependent transitions that are most affected by HpTx2; in contrast, it is the voltage-independent step in Kv4.1 that is most affected by the presence of toxin. These data demonstrate the basis for subtype-specificity of HpTx2 and point the way to a general model of gating modifier toxin interaction with voltage-gated ion channels. V374A KCND3 Pathogenic Variant Associated With Paroxysmal Ataxia Exacerbations. OBJECTIVE: Ataxia channelopathies share common features such as slow motor progression and variable degrees of cognitive dysfunction. Mutations in potassium voltage-gated channel\ntype 19/22 (SCA19/22), revealing a previously unknown role for the voltage-gated potassium channel, Kv4.3, in Purkinje cell survival. However, how mutant Kv4.3 affects wild-type Kv4.3 channel functioning remains unknown. We provide evidence that SCA19/22-mutant Kv4.3 exerts a dominant negative effect on the trafficking and surface expression of wild-type Kv4.3 in the absence of its regulatory subunit, KChIP2. Notably, this dominant negative effect can be rescued by the presence of KChIP2. We also found that all SCA19/22-mutant subunits either suppress wild-type Kv4.3 current amplitude or alter channel gating in a dominant manner. Our findings suggest that altered Kv4.3 channel localization and/or functioning resulting from SCA19/22 mutations may lead to Purkinje cell loss, neurodegeneration and ataxia.

Introduction Spinocerebellar ataxia type 19/22 (SCA19/22) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative, clinically heterogeneous disorder caused by mutations\nwith no effects on channel activation or inactivation. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated adequate cell membrane translocation of the Kv4.3 V374A variant, thus suggesting an impairment of channel function, rather than of expression. Computational modeling predicted an increased Purkinje neuron firing frequency upon reduced Kv4.3 conductance.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that Kv4.3 V374A is likely pathogenic and associated with paroxysmal ataxia exacerbations, a new trait for SCA19/22. The present FDG PET findings contrast with a previous study demonstrating widespread brain hypometabolism in SCA19/22. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 19/22 mutations alter heterocomplex Kv4.3 channel function and gating in a dominant manner The dominantly inherited cerebellar ataxias are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders caused by Purkinje cell loss in the cerebellum. Recently, we identified loss-of-function mutations in the KCND3 gene as the cause of spinocerebellar ataxia type 19/22 (SCA19/22), revealing a previously unknown role for the voltage-gated potassium channel, Kv4.3, in Purkinje cell survival. However, how\nthe Kv4.3 T1 domain. Molecular studies of voltage-gated potassium channels. The cloning and characterization of the voltage-activated Shaker potassium channel gene in Drosophila have led to the identification of structural elements involved in potassium channel gating. As found for the voltage-activated sodium channel, the S4 segment, located in the conserved core of the protein, plays a central role in voltage-dependent activation. Potassium channels appear to be formed by the assembly of several polypeptides into multisubunit channels. This is directly analogous to the proposed folding of the four internally homologous pseudosubunits of sodium and calcium channels. The amino- and carboxy-terminal regions of Shaker channels are specialized for, and appear to interact in, inactivation gating. This interaction probably includes interaction between subunits, as may be said for the role in inactivation gating of the junction between the carboxyl terminus of the third domain and amino terminus of the fourth domain of sodium\nwe investigate through fully atomistic simulations the structure and stability of the human Kv4.3 tetramerization (T1) domain in complex with KChIP1 upon specific mutations located in the first and second interfaces of the complex, as compared to the wild-type (WT). Our results nicely complement the available structural and biophysical information collected so far on these complex variants. In particular, the degree of structural deviations and energetic instability, from small to substantial, observed in these variants with respect to the WT model seems to parallel well the level of channel dysfunction known from electrophysiology data. Our simulations provide an octameric structure of the WT KChIP1-Kv4.3 assembly very similar to the known crystal structures, and, at the same time, highlight the importance of a previously overlooked site of interaction between KChIP1 and the Kv4.3 T1 domain. Molecular studies of voltage-gated potassium channels. The cloning and characterization of the voltage-activated Shaker potassium channel\nthe causal mutation in a large SCA19 family. We then screened 230 ataxia families for mutations located in the same gene (KCND3, also known as Kv4.3) using high-resolution melting. SCA19 brain autopsy material was evaluated, and in vitro experiments using ectopic expression of wild-type and mutant Kv4.3 were used to study protein localization, stability, and channel activity by patch-clamping.RESULTS: We detected a T352P mutation in the third extracellular loop of the voltage-gated potassium channel KCND3 that cosegregated with the disease phenotype in our original family. We identified 2 more novel missense mutations in the channel pore (M373I) and the S6 transmembrane domain (S390N) in 2 other ataxia families. T352P cerebellar autopsy material showed severe Purkinje cell degeneration, with abnormal intracellular accumulation and reduced protein levels of Kv4.3 in their soma. Ectopic expression of all mutant proteins in HeLa cells revealed retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and enhanced protein instability, in\nof defective protein trafficking of a mutant HERG potassium channel in human long QT syndrome. Pharmacological and temperature effects Improved functional expression of recombinant human ether-a-go-go (hERG) K+ channels by cultivation at reduced temperature The stoichiometry and biophysical properties of the Kv4 potassium channel complex with KChIP subunits are variable depending on the relative expression level Truncated KCNQ1 mutant, A178fs/105, forms hetero-multimer channel with wild-type causing a dominant-negative suppression due to trafficking defect The G604S-hERG mutation alters the biophysical properties and exerts a dominant-negative effect on expression of hERG channels in HEK293 cells A novel KCNQ4 pore-region mutation (p.

Using fluorescence spectroscopy, isothermal calorimetry, and docking simulations we show that the novel potassium current activator, NS5806, binds at a hydrophobic site on the C terminus of KChIP3 in a calcium-dependent manner, with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 2-5 \u03bcM in the calcium-bound form. We further determined that the association between KChIP3 and the hydrophobic N terminus of Kv4.3 is calcium-dependent, with an equilibrium dissociation constant in the apo-state of 70 \u00b1 3 \u03bcM and 2.7 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM in the calcium-bound form. NS5806 increases the affinity between KChIP3 and the N terminus of Kv4.3 (Kd = 1.9 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM) in the presence and absence of calcium. Mutation of Tyr-174 or Phe-218 on KChIP3 abolished\nmaterial.

In all our experiments, we expressed Kv4.3/KChIP2 at equal levels. In our first scenario, the assembly of S390N and \u0394F227 mutant homocomplexes, even in the presence of KChIP2, causes partial haploinsufficiency due to almost complete endoplasmic reticulum retention and reduced channel complex stability. Dominant negative effects on the plasma membrane trafficking have also been seen in other potassium channelopathies, such as long QT syndrome type 1 and 2, nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness type 2 and SCA13, which are disorders caused by truncating and missense mutations in other voltage-gated potassium channels Kv7.1, Kv11.1, Kv7.4 and Kv3.3, respectively. The dominant effect on WT protein trafficking exerted by these mutant Kv channels might be due to the existence of a common pathomechanism underlying different Kv-driven diseases induced by temperature-sensitive folding deficits. This mechanism\nKv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels in developmental perspective. Kv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels consist of two types of \u03b1-subunits: (a) electrically-active Kcnb1 \u03b1-subunits and (b) silent or modulatory \u03b1-subunits plus \u03b2-subunits that, similar to silent \u03b1-subunits, also regulate electrically-active subunits. Voltage-gated potassium channels were traditionally viewed, mainly by electrophysiologists, as regulators of the electrical activity of the plasma membrane in excitable cells, a role that is performed by transmembrane protein domains of \u03b1-subunits that form the electric pore. Genetic studies revealed a role for this region of \u03b1-subunits of voltage-gated potassium channels in human neurodevelopmental disorders, such as epileptic encephalopathy. The N- and C-terminal domains of \u03b1-subunits interact to form the cytoplasmic subunit of heterotetrameric potassium channels that regulate electric pores. Subsequent animal studies revealed the developmental functions of Kcnb1-containing voltage-gated potassium channels and illustrated their role during brain development and reproduction. These functions of potassium channels are discussed in this review\nassociation of KV4.3 gain-of-function and early-onset lone AF further supports the hypothesis that increased potassium current enhances AF susceptibility. Inter-Regulation of Kv4.3 and Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels Underlies Predisposition to Cardiac and Neuronal Channelopathies. BACKGROUND: Genetic variants in voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav) encoded by SCNXA genes, responsible for INa, and Kv4.3 channels encoded by KCND3, responsible for the transient outward current (Ito), contribute to the manifestation of both Brugada syndrome (BrS) and spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA19/22). We examined the hypothesis that Kv4.3 and Nav variants regulate each other's function, thus modulating INa/Ito balance in cardiomyocytes and INa/I(A) balance in neurons.METHODS: Bicistronic and other constructs were used to express WT or variant Nav1.5 and Kv4.3 channels in HEK293 cells. INa and Ito were recorded.RESULTS: SCN5A variants associated with BrS reduced INa, but increased Ito. Moreover, BrS and SCA19/22 KCND3 variants associated with a gain of function of Ito, significantly reduced INa, whereas the",

Finally, we provide structural, biochemical, and molecular genetic evidence identifying the Hsp15 homolog (encoded by rqcP) as a novel RQC component that completes the cycle by stabilizing the P-site tRNA conformation. Ala tailing thus follows mechanistic principles surprisingly similar to canonical translation elongation. Bacterial ribosome collision sensing by a MutS DNA repair ATPase paralog Ribosome stalling during translation is detrimental to cellular fitness, but how this is sensed and elicits recycling of ribosomal subunits and quality control of associated mRNA and incomplete nascent-chains is poorly understood. Here we uncover Bacillus subtilis MutS2, a member of the conserved MutS-family of ATPases that function in DNA-mismatch repair as an unexpected ribosome-binding protein with an essential function in translational quality control. Cryo-EM analysis of affinity-purified native complexes reveals that MutS2 functions in sensing collisions between stalled and translating ribosomes and suggests how ribosome collisions can\nlarge subunit. Ancient and conserved NEMF family RQC proteins target these incomplete proteins for degradation by the addition of C-terminal \"tails.\" How such tailing can occur without the regular suite of translational components is, however, unclear. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (EM) of native complexes, we show that C-terminal tailing in Bacillus subtilis is mediated by NEMF protein RqcH in concert with RqcP, an Hsp15 family protein. Our structures reveal how these factors mediate tRNA movement across the ribosomal 50S subunit to synthesize polypeptides in the absence of mRNA or the small subunit. RqcH and RqcP catalyze processive poly-alanine synthesis in a reconstituted ribosome-associated quality control system. In the cell, stalled ribosomes are rescued through ribosome-associated protein quality-control (RQC) pathways. After splitting of the stalled ribosome, a C-terminal polyalanine 'tail' is added to the unfinished polypeptide attached to the tRNA on the 50S ribosomal subunit. In Bacillus subtilis, polyalanine tailing is\nmRNA-independent elongation of nascent chains. In Eukarya, stalled translation induces 40S dissociation and recruitment of the ribosome quality control complex (RQC) to the 60S subunit, which mediates nascent chain degradation. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures revealing that the RQC components Rqc2p (YPL009C/Tae2) and Ltn1p (YMR247C/Rkr1) bind to the 60S subunit at sites exposed after 40S dissociation, placing the Ltn1p RING (Really Interesting New Gene) domain near the exit channel and Rqc2p over the P-site transfer RNA (tRNA). We further demonstrate that Rqc2p recruits alanine- and threonine-charged tRNA to the A site and directs the elongation of nascent chains independently of mRNA or 40S subunits. Our work uncovers an unexpected mechanism of protein synthesis, in which a protein--not an mRNA--determines tRNA recruitment and the tagging of nascent chains with carboxy-terminal Ala and Thr extensions (\"CAT tails\"). Structure of Escherichia coli heat shock protein Hsp15 in complex with the ribosomal 50S\nthe P site, which allows peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase Ptrh1 to cleave NC-tRNA, suggesting the existence of a pathway involving release of non-ubiquitinated NCs. Association with NEMF and Listerin and ubiquitination of NCs results in accommodation of NC-tRNA, rendering 60S RNCs resistant to Ptrh1 but susceptible to ANKZF1, which induces specific cleavage in the tRNA acceptor arm, releasing proteasome-degradable Ub-NCs linked to four 3'-terminal tRNA nucleotides. We also found that TCF25, a poorly characterized RQC component, ensures preferential formation of the K48-ubiquitin linkage. Structural basis for translational surveillance by the large ribosomal subunit-associated protein quality control complex. All organisms have evolved mechanisms to manage the stalling of ribosomes upon translation of aberrant mRNA. In eukaryotes, the large ribosomal subunit-associated quality control complex (RQC), composed of the listerin/Ltn1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and cofactors, mediates the ubiquitylation and extraction of ribosome-stalled nascent polypeptide chains for proteasomal degradation. How RQC recognizes stalled ribosomes and performs\nactivity. This state does not specifically select deacylated tRNA since the interaction is only moderately affected by tRNA aminoacylation. Once bound to the vacant ribosomal A-site, Rel assumes an 'open' conformation, which primes its TGS and Helical domains for specific recognition and stabilization of cognate deacylated tRNA on the ribosome. The tRNA locks Rel on the ribosome in a hyperactivated state that processively synthesises (p)ppGpp while the hydrolysis is suppressed. In stark contrast to non-specific tRNA interactions off the ribosome, tRNA-dependent Rel locking on the ribosome and activation of (p)ppGpp synthesis are highly specific and completely abrogated by tRNA aminoacylation. Binding pppGpp to a dedicated allosteric site located in the N-terminal catalytic domain region of the enzyme further enhances its synthetase activity. Protein synthesis.

In Eukarya, stalled translation induces 40S dissociation and recruitment of the ribosome quality control complex\nbasic module to bind RNA. Mimicry of Canonical Translation Elongation Underlies Alanine Tail Synthesis in RQC. Aborted translation produces large ribosomal subunits obstructed with tRNA-linked nascent chains, which are substrates of ribosome-associated quality control (RQC). Bacterial RqcH, a widely conserved RQC factor, senses the obstruction and recruits tRNAAla(UGC) to modify nascent-chain C termini with a polyalanine degron. However, how RqcH and its eukaryotic homologs (Rqc2 and NEMF), despite their relatively simple architecture, synthesize such C-terminal tails in the absence of a small ribosomal subunit and mRNA has remained unknown. Here, we present cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Bacillus subtilis RQC complexes representing different Ala tail synthesis steps. The structures explain how tRNAAla is selected via anticodon reading during recruitment to the A-site and uncover striking hinge-like movements in RqcH leading tRNAAla into a hybrid A/P-state associated with peptidyl-transfer. Finally, we provide structural, biochemical, and molecular genetic evidence identifying the Hsp15\nMoreover, the in vitro reconstituted system recapitulates our in vivo findings by reproducing the importance of conserved residues of RqcH and RqcP for functionality. Collectively, our findings provide mechanistic insight into the role of RqcH and RqcP in the bacterial RQC pathway. Release of Ubiquitinated and Non-ubiquitinated Nascent Chains from Stalled Mammalian Ribosomal Complexes by ANKZF1 and Ptrh1. The ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway degrades nascent chains (NCs) arising from interrupted translation. First, recycling factors split stalled ribosomes, yielding NC-tRNA/60S ribosome-nascent chain complexes (60S RNCs). 60S RNCs associate with NEMF, which recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase Listerin that ubiquitinates NCs. The mechanism of subsequent ribosomal release of Ub-NCs remains obscure. We found that, in non-ubiquitinated 60S RNCs and 80S RNCs formed on non-stop mRNAs, tRNA is not firmly fixed in the P site, which allows peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase Ptrh1 to cleave NC-tRNA, suggesting the existence of a pathway involving release of\ncontrol and CAT tailing Alanine Tails Signal Proteolysis in Bacterial Ribosome-Associated Quality Control Ribosome states signal RNA quality control Ribosomal stress-surveillance: three pathways is a magic number Collided ribosomes form a unique structural interface to induce Hel2-driven quality control pathways Ribosome Collision Is Critical for Quality Control during No-Go Decay ZNF598 Is a Quality Control Sensor of Collided Ribosomes The E3 ubiquitin ligase and RNA-binding protein ZNF598 orchestrates ribosome quality control of premature polyadenylated mRNAs ZNF598 and RACK1 Regulate Mammalian Ribosome-Associated Quality Control Function by Mediating Regulatory 40S Ribosomal Ubiquitylation The ASC-1 Complex Disassembles Collided Ribosomes RQT complex dissociates ribosomes collided on endogenous RQC substrate SDD1 Ubiquitination of stalled ribosome triggers ribosome-associated quality control NONU-1 Encodes a Conserved Endonuclease Required for mRNA Translation Surveillance The endonuclease Cue2 cleaves mRNAs at stalled ribosomes during No Go Decay Ribosome recycling in mRNA translation, quality control, and homeostasis Ubiquitin signals protein trafficking via\nthe distally located nascent chain tunnel exit. This work provides insights into a mechanism linking translation and protein degradation that targets defective proteins immediately after synthesis, while ignoring nascent chains in normally translating ribosomes. Ribosome association primes the stringent factor Rel for tRNA-dependent locking in the A-site and activation of (p)ppGpp synthesis. In the Gram-positive Firmicute bacterium Bacillus subtilis, amino acid starvation induces synthesis of the alarmone (p)ppGpp by the RelA/SpoT Homolog factor Rel. This bifunctional enzyme is capable of both synthesizing and hydrolysing (p)ppGpp. To detect amino acid deficiency, Rel monitors the aminoacylation status of the ribosomal A-site tRNA by directly inspecting the tRNA's CCA end. Here we dissect the molecular mechanism of B. subtilis Rel. Off the ribosome, Rel predominantly assumes a 'closed' conformation with dominant (p)ppGpp hydrolysis activity. This state does not specifically select deacylated tRNA since the interaction is only moderately affected by tRNA aminoacylation. Once\nprotein S6 kinase 1 and 2 (RPS6KA1, RPS6KA3). Further, loss of Ltn1 function results in hyperactivation of RSK1/2 signaling without impacting RSK1/2 protein turnover. These results suggest that Ltn1-mediated RSK1/2 ubiquitylation is inhibitory and establishes a new role for Ltn1 in regulating mitogen-activated kinase signaling via regulatory RSK1/2 ubiquitylation. Taken together, our results suggest that mammalian RQC interactions are difficult to observe and may be more transient than the homologous complex in S. cerevisiae and that Ltn1 has RQC-independent functions. The ribosome-bound quality control complex remains associated to aberrant peptides during their proteasomal targeting and interacts with Tom1 to limit protein aggregation. Protein quality control mechanisms eliminate defective polypeptides to ensure proteostasis and to avoid the toxicity of protein aggregates. In eukaryotes, the ribosome-bound quality control (RQC) complex detects aberrant nascent peptides that remain stalled in 60S ribosomal particles due to a dysfunction in translation termination. The RQC complex polyubiquitylates\nAla and Thr extensions (\"CAT tails\"). Structure of Escherichia coli heat shock protein Hsp15 in complex with the ribosomal 50S subunit bearing peptidyl-tRNA. In Escherichia coli, the heat shock protein 15 (Hsp15) is part of the cellular response to elevated temperature. Hsp15 interacts with peptidyl-tRNA-50S complexes that arise upon dissociation of translating 70S ribosomes, and is proposed to facilitate their rescue and recycling. A previous structure of E. coli Hsp15 in complex with peptidyl-tRNA-50S complex reported a binding site located at the central protuberance of the 50S subunit. By contrast, recent structures of RqcP, the Hsp15 homolog in Bacillus subtilis, in complex with peptidyl-tRNA-50S complexes have revealed a distinct site positioned between the anticodon-stem-loop (ASL) of the P-site tRNA and H69 of the 23S rRNA. Here we demonstrate that exposure of E. coli cells to heat shock leads to a decrease in 70S ribosomes and accumulation of 50S subunits, thus\nadded to the unfinished polypeptide attached to the tRNA on the 50S ribosomal subunit. In Bacillus subtilis, polyalanine tailing is catalyzed by the NEMF family protein RqcH, in cooperation with RqcP. However, the mechanistic details of this process remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that RqcH is responsible for tRNAAla selection during RQC elongation, whereas RqcP lacks any tRNA specificity. The ribosomal protein uL11 is crucial for RqcH, but not RqcP, recruitment to the 50S subunit, and B. subtilis lacking uL11 are RQC-deficient. Through mutational mapping, we identify critical residues within RqcH and RqcP that are important for interaction with the P-site tRNA and/or the 50S subunit. Additionally, we have reconstituted polyalanine-tailing in vitro and can demonstrate that RqcH and RqcP are necessary and sufficient for processivity in a minimal system. Moreover, the in vitro reconstituted system recapitulates our in vivo findings by reproducing the importance of conserved residues of RqcH\naccession codes PDB-7QV1 [https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7QV1] (\u2018collided disomes\u2019: 70S leading ribosome), PDB-7QV2 [https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7QV2] (\u2018collided disomes\u2019: 70S collided ribosome) and PDB-7QV3 [https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7QV3] (\u2018+MutS2 Conformation 2\u2019: 70S leading ribosome bound to MutS2 in conformation 2).

Ribosome stalling can be detrimental to cellular fitness, among other reasons, for producing aberrant and potentially toxic nascent polypeptides. Bacteria and eukaryotes were initially thought to have evolutionarily unrelated processes for targeting such products of ribosome stalling for degradation\u2014transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA or SsrA) and ribosome-associated quality control (RQC), respectively. More recently, however, it has been discovered that the conserved protein, RqcH, mediates a process in bacteria that is homologous to eukaryotic RQC. There has been great recent interest in understanding how stalled ribosomes are sensed and elicit RQC and other processes (see e.g.,). An emerging notion is that the mRNA location of a stalling site (i.e., at the 3\u2019 end versus at an internal position) confers unique structural features to stalled ribosomal complexes, which in turn dictate alternative\nstates. The leading ribosome is unrotated and associated with a nascent-chain linked tRNA in a canonical P-site conformation (Fig. 2c). The mRNA can be continuously traced throughout the ribosomal mRNA channel including the ribosomal A-site, indicating that the leading ribosomes have stalled in internal sites of endogenous mRNAs. In contrast, the collided ribosome is in a rotated, pre-translocation state, associated with a nascent chain-linked A/P-site tRNA and a P/E-site tRNA (Fig. 2c). The mRNA can be traced throughout the mRNA channel and projects out from the mRNA exit site (Fig. 2c) interacting with the anti-Shine-Dalgarno rRNA (Extended Data Fig. 5a). For ~5 % of disomes we observed density corresponding to a third ribosome collided into the disome unit (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Even though only moderately resolved, the third ribosome is similar to the collided ribosome of the disome unit regarding overall structure. Strikingly, and differently from eukaryotic collided disomes,\nMapping the mammalian ribosome quality control complex interactome using proximity labeling approaches. Previous genetic and biochemical studies from Saccharomyces cerevisiae have identified a critical ribosome-associated quality control complex (RQC) that facilitates resolution of stalled ribosomal complexes. While components of the mammalian RQC have been examined in vitro, a systematic characterization of RQC protein interactions in mammalian cells has yet to be described. Here we utilize both proximity-labeling proteomic approaches, BioID and APEX, and traditional affinity-based strategies to both identify interacting proteins of mammalian RQC members and putative substrates for the RQC resident E3 ligase, Ltn1. Surprisingly, validation studies revealed that a subset of substrates are ubiquitylated by Ltn1 in a regulatory manner that does not result in subsequent substrate degradation. We demonstrate that Ltn1 catalyzes the regulatory ubiquitylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 and 2 (RPS6KA1, RPS6KA3). Further, loss of Ltn1 function results in hyperactivation of RSK1/2 signaling without\nmRNAs A steric block in translation caused by the antibiotic spectinomycin The structural basis for the action of the antibiotics tetracycline, pactamycin, and hygromycin B on the 30S ribosomal subunit High-resolution crystal structures of ribosome-bound chloramphenicol and erythromycin provide the ultimate basis for their competition Mimicry of Canonical Translation Elongation Underlies Alanine Tail Synthesis in RQC Structural Basis for Bacterial Ribosome-Associated Quality Control by RqcH and RqcP RqcH and RqcP catalyze processive poly-alanine synthesis in a reconstituted ribosome-associated quality control system Convergence of mammalian RQC and C-end rule proteolytic pathways via alanine tailing Crystal structure of a 70S ribosome-tRNA complex reveals functional interactions and rearrangements Bacterial RNA Degradosomes: Molecular Machines under Tight Control New vector for efficient allelic replacement in naturally nontransformable, low-GC-content, gram-positive bacteria Construction and Analysis of Two Genome-Scale Deletion Libraries for Bacillus subtilis proGenomes2: an improved database for accurate and consistent habitat, taxonomic and functional annotations of\nnative complexes reveals that MutS2 functions in sensing collisions between stalled and translating ribosomes and suggests how ribosome collisions can serve as platforms to deploy downstream processes: MutS2 has an RNA endonuclease Small MutS-Related (SMR) domain, as well as an ATPase/clamp domain that is properly positioned to promote ribosomal subunit dissociation, which is a requirement both for ribosome recycling and for initiating ribosome-associated protein quality control (RQC). Accordingly, Muts2 promotes nascent chain modification with Alanine-tail degrons\u2014an early step in RQC\u2014in an ATPase domain-dependent manner. The relevance of these observations is underscored by evidence of strong co-occurrence of MutS2 and RQC genes across bacterial phyla. Overall, the findings reveal a deeply-conserved role of ribosome collisions in mounting a complex response to the interruption of translation within open reading frames.

The presence of an ITIM generally correlates with inhibitory activity among NKC lectin-like receptors, as demonstrated by the human NKG2 receptor family. Lanier and his colleagues have recently shown that NKG2 receptors can form heterodimers with the invariant lectin-like receptor CD94. Selective association of CD94 with different NKG2 receptors may explain functional differences for CD94 in different NK clones. Modulation of NK cell function by genetically coupled C-type lectin-like receptor/ligand pairs encoded in the human natural killer gene complex. Functional responses of natural killer (NK) cells including eradication of \"harmful\" cells and modulation of immune responses are regulated by a broad variety of activating and inhibitory NK receptors. Whereas the leukocyte receptor complex (LRC) encodes for NK receptors of the immunoglobulin superfamily, genes of C-type lectin-like NK receptors are clustered in the\nCrystal structure of the C-type lectin-like domain from the human hematopoietic cell receptor CD69. CD69, one of the earliest specific antigens acquired during lymphoid activation, acts as a signal-transducing receptor involved in cellular activation events, including proliferation and induction of specific genes. CD69 belongs to a family of receptors that modulate the immune response and whose genes are clustered in the natural killer (NK) gene complex. The extracellular portion of these receptors represent a subfamily of C-type lectin-like domains (CTLDs), which are divergent from true C-type lectins and are referred to as NK-cell domains (NKDs). We have determined the three-dimensional structure of human CD69 NKD in two different crystal forms. CD69 NKD adopts the canonical CTLD fold but lacks the features involved in Ca(2+) and carbohydrate binding by C-type lectins. CD69 NKD dimerizes noncovalently, both in solution and in crystalline state. The dimer interface consists of a hydrophobic, loosely packed\nresponses were augmented in Clec12A-deficient mice after infection. In contrast, human Clec12A transgenic mice were susceptible to infection with M. tuberculosis. These results suggest that mycobacteria dampen host immune responses by hijacking an inhibitory host receptor through their specific and essential lipids, mycolic acids. The blockade of this interaction might provide a therapeutic option for the treatment or prevention of mycobacterial infection. BACL is a novel brain-associated, non-NKC-encoded mammalian C-type lectin-like receptor of the CLEC2 family. Natural Killer Gene Complex (NKC)-encoded C-type lectin-like receptors (CTLRs) are expressed on various immune cells including T cells, NK cells and myeloid cells and thereby contribute to the orchestration of cellular immune responses. Some NKC-encoded CTLRs are grouped into the C-type lectin family 2 (CLEC2 family) and interact with genetically linked CTLRs of the NKRP1 family. While many CLEC2 family members are expressed by hematopoietic cells (e.g. CD69 (CLEC2C)), others such as the keratinocyte-associated\na set of Ig-SF receptors (p50) homologous to p58 KIRs also display an activating function. CD94-associated molecules belong to the NKG2 family of C-type lectins; the NKG2-A gene encodes for the p43 subunit, which contains cytoplasmic ITIMS. Expression of the different CD94 heterodimeric receptors will enable precise analysis of their putative interaction with HLA class I molecules. MICL controls inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis. BACKGROUND: Myeloid inhibitory C-type lectin-like receptor (MICL, Clec12A) is a C-type lectin receptor (CLR) expressed predominantly by myeloid cells. Previous studies have suggested that MICL is involved in controlling inflammation.OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of this CLR in inflammatory pathology using Clec12A(-/-) mice.METHODS: Clec12A(-/-) mice were generated commercially and primarily characterised using the collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) model.

(C) Statistical analysis: One sample Wilcoxon test ** p < 0.01. Characterisation of murine MICL (CLEC12A) and evidence for an endogenous ligand. Inhibitory receptors are required for the control of cellular activation and they play essential roles in regulating homeostasis and immunity. We previously identified a human inhibitory C-type lectin-like receptor, MICL (CLEC12A), a heavily glycosylated monomer predominantly expressed on myeloid cells. Here we characterise the murine homolog of MICL (mMICL), and demonstrate that the receptor is structurally and functionally similar to the human orthologue (hMICL), although there are some notable differences. mMICL is expressed as a dimer and is not heavily glycosylated; however, like hMICL, the receptor can recruit inhibitory phosphatases upon activation, and is down-regulated on leukocytes following stimulation with selected TLR agonists. Using novel monoclonal antibodies, we demonstrate that, like the human receptor, mMICL is predominantly expressed by myeloid cells. However, mMICL\nlow density lipoprotein receptor-1 expression in endothelial cells Identification of soluble forms of lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1 Soluble lectin-like oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor-1 in type 2 diabetes mellitus Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 facilitates metastasis of gastric cancer through driving epithelial-mesenchymal transition and PI3K/Akt/GSK3\u03b2 activation The lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1: a new potential molecular target in colorectal cancer Lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1 is an enhancer of tumor angiogenesis in human prostate cancer cells Up-regulation of LOX-1 expression by TNF-\u03b1 promotes trans-endothelial migration of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells Lectin-type oxidized LDL receptor-1 distinguishes population of human polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells in cancer patients LOX-1 as a natural IFN-\u03b1-mediated signal for apoptotic cell uptake and antigen presentation in dendritic cells Mincle, the receptor for mycobacterial cord factor, forms a functional receptor complex with MCL and Fc\u03b5RI-\u03b3 A novel LPS-inducible C-type lectin is a transcriptional target of NF-IL6 in macrophages Increased expression\ncomplex with MCL and Fc\u03b5RI-\u03b3 A novel LPS-inducible C-type lectin is a transcriptional target of NF-IL6 in macrophages Increased expression of macrophage-inducible C-type lectin in adipose tissue of obese mice and humans The pattern recognition receptor, Mincle, is essential for maintaining the M1 macrophage phenotype in acute renal inflammation C-Type lectin receptor MCL facilitates mincle expression and signaling through complex formation Mincle suppresses Toll-like receptor 4 activation Mincle signaling promotes con a hepatitis Receptor Mincle promotes skin allergies and is capable of recognizing cholesterol sulfate Involvement of Mincle and Syk in the changes to innate immunity after ischemic stroke Mincle signaling in the innate immune response after traumatic brain injury Isolation and expression profiling of genes upregulated in bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells of rheumatoid arthritis patients C-type lectin receptors Mcl and Mincle control development of multiple sclerosis-like neuroinflammation Macrophage-inducible C-type lectin is associated with anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies-positive rheumatoid arthritis\nDisulfide Bonds as Structure-Forming Units: Insights From Different Domains of Life and the Potential for Characterization by NMR NADPH oxidase: An update The roles of flotillin microdomains\u2013endocytosis and beyond C-Type lectin-like domains in Caenorhabditis elegans: Predictions from the complete genome sequence The Human C-Type Lectin-Like Receptor CLEC-1 is Upregulated by TGF-\u03b2 and Primarily Localized in the Endoplasmic Membrane Compartment Human Lectin-Like Oxidized Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-1 Functions as a Dimer in Living Cells Differential Roles of Cysteine Residues in the Cellular Trafficking, Dimerization, and Function of the High-Density Lipoprotein Receptor, SR-BI Membrane and raft association of reggie-1/flotillin-2: Role of myristoylation, palmitoylation and oligomerization and induction of filopodia by overexpression Stalk domain C118 and C130 residues regulate CLEC12A cell-surface expression and oligomerisation.

All constructs are HA-tagged\nstressed or virally infected cells. NK cell recognition of a target cell is mediated by a receptor \"zipper\" consisting of various activating and inhibitory receptors, including C-type lectin-like receptors. Among this major group of receptors, two of the largest rodent receptor families are the NKR-P1 and the Clr receptor families. Although these families have been shown to encode receptor-ligand pairs involved in MHC-independent self-nonself discrimination and are a target for immune evasion by tumour cells and viruses, structural mechanisms of their mutual recognition remain less well characterized. Therefore, we developed a non-viral eukaryotic expression system based on transient transfection of suspension-adapted human embryonic kidney 293 cells to produce soluble native disulphide dimers of NK cell C-type lectin-like receptor ectodomains. The expression system was optimized using green fluorescent protein and secreted alkaline phosphatase, easily quantifiable markers of recombinant protein production.

However, release of anti-microbial molecules, such as reactive oxygen species by myeloid cells can further damage the tissue. Thus, inflammatory response can cause disease particularly in the case of dysregulated or excessive cell death. Molecules associated with dying/dead cells are detected by diverse receptors that via particular signaling, impact cell function and determine whether death is immunogenic or tolerogenic. Prominent among death sensors are the members of the C-type lectin receptor superfamily expressed mostly by myeloid cells. They constitute transmembrane and soluble receptors containing at least one carbohydrate recognition domain, in the broader sense, a C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD). Via this domain, these receptors usually bind carbohydrates through a Ca2+ dependent conserved motif. However, some of them lack the\ncontexts, including gout, rheumatoid arthritis, and viral infection. In knock-out mouse models of gout and rheumatoid arthritis, a diminution in CLEC12A expression enhances inflammation and disease severity. Similarly, low levels of CLEC12A expression by circulating neutrophils and monocytes from early rheumatoid arthritis patients correlate with higher disease activity. On the other hand, interferon production is significantly downregulated in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infected CLEC12A KO mice, resulting in an increased viral load and liver damage. Thus, CLEC12A differentially regulates myeloid cell responses in a stimulus-dependent manner. CLEC12A has an extracellular C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD), the defining feature of C-type lectin receptors (CLRs). While CTLDs typically bind a diverse array of carbohydrate ligands and some have evolved to bind proteins, endogenous ligands that specifically bind the CLEC12A CTLD remain unidentified. CLEC12A CTLD is linked to the transmembrane domain by a stalk region that mediates receptor oligomerisation in other CLRs The short cytoplasmic\ndata suggest an entirely new mechanism underlying RA pathogenesis, whereby the threshold of myeloid cell activation can be modulated by autoantibodies that bind to cell membrane-expressed inhibitory receptors. Regulation of the Expression, Oligomerisation and Signaling of the Inhibitory Receptor CLEC12A by Cysteine Residues in the Stalk Region CLEC12A is a myeloid inhibitory receptor that negatively regulates inflammation in mouse models of autoimmune and autoinflammatory arthritis. Reduced CLEC12A expression enhances myeloid cell activation and inflammation in CLEC12A knock-out mice with collagen antibody-induced or gout-like arthritis. Similarly to other C-type lectin receptors, CLEC12A harbours a stalk domain between its ligand binding and transmembrane domains. While it is presumed that the cysteines in the stalk domain have multimerisation properties, their role in CLEC12A expression and/or signaling remain unknown. We thus used site-directed mutagenesis to determine whether the stalk domain cysteines play a role in CLEC12A expression, internalisation, oligomerisation, and/or signaling. Mutation of C118\nreporter cell assays did neither indicate interaction of BACL with the KLRG2 ectodomain nor with human NK cell lines or lymphocytes. Along these lines, growth of BACL-expressing tumor cell lines in immunocompetent mice did not provide evidence for an immune-related function of BACL. Altogether, the CLEC2L gene encodes a homodimeric cell surface CTLR that stands out among CLEC2 family members by its conservation in mammals, its biochemical properties and the predominant expression in the brain. Future studies will have to reveal insights into the functional relevance of BACL in the context of its neuronal expression. Structure and function of the CD94 C-type lectin receptor complex involved in recognition of HLA class I molecules. A multigene family of immunoglobulin superfamily (Ig-SF) killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIRs) specifically recognize HLA class I molecules, while the interaction with H-2 products is mediated by members of the murine Ly49 C-type lectin family.

SUMMARY: After binding its natural ligand cluster of differentiation 70 (CD70), CD27, a tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor-binding member of the TNFR family, regulates cellular activity in subsets of T, B, and natural killer cells as well as hematopoietic progenitor cells. In normal immune responses, CD27 signaling appears to be limited predominantly by the restricted expression of CD70, which is only transiently expressed by cells of the immune system upon activation. Studies performed in CD27-deficient and CD70-transgenic mice have defined a non-redundant role of this receptor-ligand pair in shaping adaptive T-cell responses. Moreover, adjuvant properties of CD70 have been exploited for the design of anti-cancer vaccines. However, continuous CD27-CD70 interactions may cause immune dysregulation and immunopathology in conditions of chronic immune activation such as during persistent virus infection and autoimmune disease. We conclude that\nStructural delineation and phase-dependent activation of the costimulatory CD27:CD70 complex. CD27 is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor, which stimulates lymphocytes and promotes their differentiation upon activation by TNF ligand CD70. Activation of the CD27 receptor provides a costimulatory signal to promote T cell, B cell, and NK cell activity to facilitate antitumor and anti-infection immunity. Aberrant increased and focused expression of CD70 on many tumor cells renders CD70 an attractive therapeutic target for direct tumor killing. However, despite their use as drug targets to treat cancers, the molecular basis and atomic details of CD27 and CD70 interaction remain elusive. Here we report the crystal structure of human CD27 in complex with human CD70. Analysis of our structure shows that CD70 adopts a classical TNF ligand homotrimeric assembly to engage CD27 receptors in a 3:3 stoichiometry. By combining structural and rational mutagenesis data with reported disease-correlated mutations, we identified the\nCD27 receptors in a 3:3 stoichiometry. By combining structural and rational mutagenesis data with reported disease-correlated mutations, we identified the key amino acid residues of CD27 and CD70 that control this interaction. We also report increased potency for plate-bound CD70 constructs compared with solution-phase ligand in a functional activity to stimulate T-cells in vitro. These findings offer new mechanistic insight into this critical costimulatory interaction. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells regulate B-cell growth and differentiation via CD70. The ability of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) to promote plasma cell differentiation and immunoglobulin (Ig) secretion through the production of type I interferon and interleukin-6 has been well documented, although the role of additional factors, including tumor necrosis factor receptor-ligand interactions, has not been addressed. On stimulation with the Toll-like receptor ligand CpG (B type, 2006) we found that pDCs exhibit strong and stable expression of CD70, a tumor necrosis factor family ligand that binds\nthis system to obtain suppression, on the other hand, do not need CD27 engagement to exert their suppressor function. CD70-CD27 interactions provide survival and proliferative signals that regulate T cell receptor-driven activation of human \u03b3\u03b4 peripheral blood lymphocytes. Human V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells are potent anti-tumor lymphocytes that specifically respond to pyrophosphate (phospho-) antigens, which constitute the basis of current \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell-based immunotherapy strategies. Despite a clear involvement of the TCR, the costimulation requirements of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells remain ill-defined. Here, we show that the expression of the CD27 receptor by the vast majority of V\u03b39V\u03b42 peripheral blood lymphocytes endows them with enhanced proliferative capacity upon ligation by its unique ligand CD70, a tumor necrosis factor superfamily member expressed on lymphoma B-cells but also on TCR-activated \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Moreover, V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-cell treatment with soluble recombinant CD70 induced calcium signals and increased transcription of anti-apoptotic Bcl2a1 and cell-cycle-promoting Cyclin D2 genes.\noffer an attractive strategy to treat solid tumors. CD27/CD70 interaction contributes to the activation and the function of human autoreactive CD27+ regulatory T cells. CD27, a tumor necrosis factor receptor family member, is a constimulatory molecule for T and B cell activation. We demonstrate here that CD27 signaling is critical for T cell activation in the autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (aMLR) and for aMLR-induced generation of regulatory T cells that suppress pokeweed mitogen-driven immunoglobulin G synthesis by B cells. Moreover, CD27, expressed on CD45RA+ CD4+ T cells, is directly involved in the suppressor function of aMLR-activated CD4+ T cells, probably by interfering with the interaction between CD70, the CD27 ligand, expressed on CD45RO+ CD4+ helper T cells, and CD27, expressed on B cells. CD8+ T cells, which are required in this system to obtain suppression, on the other hand, do not need CD27 engagement to exert their suppressor function. CD70-CD27\npromote cell survival throughout clonal expansion independent of the mTOR and IL-2R pathways. In addition, introduction of the Pim1 gene in Cd27(-/-) CD8(+) T cells partially corrected their defect in clonal expansion and formation of an effector pool. We conclude that CD27 may contribute to the survival of primed CD8(+) T cells by the upregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members but also calls the Pim-1 kinase survival pathway into action. Crystal structure of CD27 in complex with a neutralizing noncompeting antibody. CD27 is a T-cell and B-cell co-stimulatory glycoprotein of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily that is dependent on the availability of the TNF-like ligand CD70. Therapeutic approaches to treating autoimmune diseases and cancers with antagonistic and agonistic anti-CD27 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), respectively, have recently been developed. Mouse anti-human CD27 mAb 2177 shows potency in neutralizing CD70-induced signaling; however, it does not block the binding of soluble CD70.\nwhich are members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily such as CD27, 4-1BB, OX40, HVEM, CD30, and GITR, which have both redundant and unique contributions to the T cell activation process. The timing and location of different costimulatory interactions vary substantially. CD28 acts during early T cell priming and is quickly outcompeted by the coinhibitory receptor CTLA-4, whereas TNFR superfamily members and their ligands have much more complex regulation of expression during an immune response, seemingly regulating its outcome at defined phases. In addition, CD4 and CD8 T cells seem to depend primarily on different TNF/TNFR superfamily members, with CD30/CD30L and OX40/OX40L interactions being more important for CD4 cells and 4-1BB/4-1BBL for CD8 T cells. CD27-CD70 interactions have been implicated in both CD4 and CD8 T cell responses. CD27 exerts its costimulatory activity after engagement by its only known ligand, membrane-bound CD70. CD27 is highly expressed on na\u00efve\nits own levels. Therefore, the ability of CD70 to trigger costimulation is self-regulated when it binds its complementary receptor. Characterization of murine CD70 by molecular cloning and mAb. CD27, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, has been implicated in T cell activation, T cell development and T-dependent antibody production by B cells. Its ligand CD70 has been identified only in humans, and, thus, physiological and pathological roles of the CD70-CD27 interaction remain to be determined in an experimental animal system. In the present study, we identified murine (m) CD70 by molecular cloning, and characterized its expression and function by generating an anti-mCD70 mAb. The mCD70 cDNA encoded a type II transmembrane glycoprotein of the TNF family, having 56.5% identity to the human CD70 amino acid sequence. The mCd70 gene was assigned in the central region of chromosome 17.

Induced on B lymphocytes after antigenic challenge, it is a marker of memory cells. CD70, CD27 ligand, is a TNF related trans-membrane protein induced upon activation on T and B cells. In complement of ligation of CD40, another TNF receptor family member expressed by B cells, CD27/CD70 interaction plays a key role in T dependent B cell responses and is responsible for plasma cell differentiation. B lymphocyte responses appear thus controlled by different T cell subsets expressing CD154 (CD40 ligand), CD27, or CD70 (CD27 ligand).\nsignaling is regulated by the expression of its ligand CD70 on subsets of dendritic cells and lymphocytes. Here, we analyzed the role of the CD27-CD70 interaction in the immunologic control of solid tumors in Cd27-deficient mice. In tumor-bearing wild-type mice, the CD27-CD70 interaction increased the frequency of regulatory T cells (Tregs), reduced tumor-specific T-cell responses, increased angiogenesis, and promoted tumor growth. CD27 signaling reduced apoptosis of Tregs in vivo and induced CD4(+) effector T cells (Teffs) to produce interleukin-2, a key survival factor for Tregs. Consequently, the frequency of Tregs and growth of solid tumors were reduced in Cd27-deficient mice or in wild-type mice treated with monoclonal antibody to block CD27 signaling. Our findings, therefore, provide a novel mechanism by which the adaptive immune system enhances tumor growth and may offer an attractive strategy to treat solid tumors. CD27/CD70 interaction contributes to the activation and the function of human autoreactive\nimportant factor in the regulation of B-cell growth and differentiation by pDCs. Identification of CD70-mediated apoptosis of immune effector cells as a novel immune escape pathway of human glioblastoma. Interactions of CD70, a tumor necrosis factor-related cell surface ligand and its receptor, CD27, are thought to play an important role for T-, B-, and natural killer-cell activation. However, ligation of CD27 can also induce apoptosis. Human glioblastoma is paradigmatic for cancer-associated immunosuppression. We identified CD70 as a radioinducible gene in U87 MG glioma cells. A screening of a panel of human glioma cell lines revealed that 11 of 12 cell lines expressed CD70 mRNA and protein. Two human neuroblastoma cell lines did not express CD70. CD70 mRNA expression was enhanced by irradiation in 8 of 12 glioma cell lines in a p53-independent manner. No alteration in CD70 expression was observed after glioma cell exposure to cytotoxic drugs such as lomustine.\n2006) we found that pDCs exhibit strong and stable expression of CD70, a tumor necrosis factor family ligand that binds to its receptor CD27 expressed on memory B cells and promotes plasma cell differentiation and Ig secretion. Using a pDC/B-cell coculture system, we found that CpG-stimulated pDCs can induce the proliferation of CD40L-activated human peripheral B cells and Ig secretion. This occurs independently of interferon and residual CpG, and requires physical contact between pDCs and B cells. CpG-stimulated pDCs can induce the proliferation of both naive and memory B cells, although Ig secretion is restricted to the memory subset. Blocking the interaction of CD70 with CD27 using an antagonist anti-CD70 antibody reduces the induction of B-cell proliferation and IgG secretion by CpG-stimulated pDCs. We have therefore identified CD70 as an important factor in the regulation of B-cell growth and differentiation by pDCs.

CD27 signaling increases the frequency of regulatory T cells and promotes tumor growth. Signaling of the TNF receptor superfamily member CD27 activates costimulatory pathways to elicit T- and B-cell responses. CD27 signaling is regulated by the expression of its ligand CD70 on subsets of dendritic cells and lymphocytes. Here, we analyzed\nit is conceivable that some other models of rechallenge could perhaps have a different result, we find it unlikely as the endogenous memory recall response to peptide/CFA rechallenge following LCMV infection was also normal. Therefore, our data strongly suggest that CD70 is dispensable for recall responses. CD70 has been established as a prominent factor in generating productive immune responses in several vaccination strategies. Moreover, manipulation of CD70-CD27 axis can break tolerance and enhance T cell-mediated tumor control as well as allograft rejection. Because CD27-CD70 interactions have both beneficial and deleterious effects, to therapeutically exploit this costimulatory pathway a thorough understanding of the underlying biology is of considerable importance. CD70\u2212/\u2212 mice should be a useful tool in further explorations of how this receptor-ligand pair regulates adaptive and, perhaps, innate immune functions.

Expression of CD27-CD70 on early B cell progenitors in the bone marrow: implication for diagnosis and therapy of childhood ALL. OBJECTIVE: CD27, a member of the TNF receptor family, plays an important role in lymphoid proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. This study addresses the expression of CD27 and its ligand, CD70, in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and the possible role of this receptor-ligand pair in the pathogenesis of ALL.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Expression of CD27 and CD70 was evaluated with three-color flow cytometry in blood and bone marrow (BM) samples in children with ALL and controls. The biological role of these molecules on leukemic cell proliferation was studied in an in vitro culture system.RESULTS: The expression of the membrane bound CD27, as well as membrane bound CD70, on CD19(+) cells in the\nFurther studies are required to pin-point the role of this receptor-ligand pair in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. CD70-deficiency impairs effector CD8 T cell generation and viral clearance but is dispensable for the recall response to LCMV CD27 interactions with its ligand, CD70, are thought to be necessary for optimal primary and memory adaptive immune responses to a variety of pathogens. Thus far all studies addressing the function of the CD27-CD70 axis have been performed either in mice lacking CD27, overexpressing CD70, or in which these receptors were blocked or mimicked by antibodies or recombinant soluble CD70. Because these methods have in some cases led to divergent results, we generated CD70-deficient mice to directly assess its role in vivo. We find that lack of CD70-mediated stimulation during primary responses to LCMV lowered the magnitude of CD8 antigen-specific T cell response, resulting in impaired viral clearance, without affecting CD4 T cell responses.\na p53-independent manner. No alteration in CD70 expression was observed after glioma cell exposure to cytotoxic drugs such as lomustine. CD70 protein was also detected by immunocytochemistry in 5 of 12 glioblastomas and 3 of 4 anaplastic astrocytomas in vivo. CD27 expression was not detected in any glioma cell line, and there was no evidence for autocrine or backward signaling of the CD70 system in human glioma cells. Unexpectedly, CD70 expressed on glioma cells did not increase the immunogenicity of glioma cells in vitro. In contrast, CD70-positive glioma cells induced apoptosis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a CD70-dependent manner. Neutralization of CD70 expressed on glioma cells prevented apoptosis and enhanced the release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in cocultures of glioma cells and PBMCs. The effects of CD70-expressing glioma cells on PBMCs were mimicked by agonistic CD27 antibodies. Conversely, the shedding of CD27 by PBMCs was identified as a\nand immunopathology in conditions of chronic immune activation such as during persistent virus infection and autoimmune disease. We conclude that optimal tuning of CD27-CD70 interaction is crucial for the regulation of the cellular immune response. We provide a detailed comparison of costimulation through CD27 with its closely related family members 4-1BB (CD137), CD30, herpes virus entry mediator, OX40 (CD134), and glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related gene, and we argue that these receptors do not have a unique function per se but that rather the timing, context, and intensity of these costimulatory signals determine the functional consequence of their activity. CD27/CD70 interactions regulate T dependent B cell differentiation. CD27 is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family member whose expression is limited to cells of the lymphoid lineage. Constitutively expressed on T lymphocytes, it is a costimulatory molecule for a regulatory subset. Induced on B lymphocytes after antigenic challenge, it is a marker",

        "desc": "G-proteins activate the channels. Canonical transient receptor potential 5. Canonical transient receptor potential 5 TRPC5 (also TrpC5, trp-5 or trp5) is one of the seven mammalian TRPC proteins. Its known functional property is that of a mixed cationic plasma membrane channel with calcium permeability. It is active alone or as a heteromultimeric assembly with TRPC1; TRPC4 and TRPC3 may also be involved. Multiple activators of TRPC5 are emerging, including various G protein-coupled receptor agonists, lysophospholipids, lanthanide ions and, in some contexts, calcium store depletion. Intracellular calcium has complex impact on TRPC5, including a permissive role for other activators, as well as inhibition at high concentrations. Protein kinase C is inhibitory and mediates desensitisation following receptor activation. Tonic TRPC5 activity is detected and may reflect the presence of constitutive activation signals. The channel has voltage dependence but the biological significance of this is unknown; it is partially due to intracellular magnesium\nassay. This screen identified SESTD1, a previously uncharacterized protein containing a lipid-binding SEC14-like domain as well as spectrin-type cytoskeleton interaction domains. SESTD1 was found to associate with TRPC4 and TRPC5 via the channel's calmodulin- and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-binding domain. In functional studies, we demonstrate that SESTD1 binds several phospholipid species in vitro and is essential for efficient receptor-mediated activation of TRPC5. Notably, phospholipid binding to SESTD1 was Ca(2+)-dependent. Because TRPC4 and -5 conduct Ca(2+), SESTD1-channel signaling may be bidirectional and also couple TRPC activity to lipid signaling through SESTD1. The modulation of TRPC channel function by specific lipid-binding proteins, such as SESTD1, adds another facet to the complex regulation of these channels complementary to the previously described effects of direct channel-phospholipid interaction. Emerging Roles of Diacylglycerol-Sensitive TRPC4/5 Channels. Transient receptor potential classical or canonical 4 (TRPC4) and TRPC5 channels are members of the classical or canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC)\nNHERF enables, the DAG sensitivity of the TRPC4 and TRPC5 channels. This leads to the assumption that all of the TRPC channels are DAG sensitive. The identification of the regulatory function of the NHERF proteins in the TRPC4/5-NHERF protein complex offers a new starting point to get deeper insights into the molecular basis of TRPC channel activation. Future studies will have to unravel the physiological and pathophysiological functions of this multi-protein channel complex. Subunit composition of mammalian transient receptor potential channels in living cells. Hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors give rise to calcium entry via receptor-activated cation channels that are activated downstream of phospholipase C activity. Members of the transient receptor potential channel (TRPC) family have been characterized as molecular substrates mediating receptor-activated cation influx. TRPC channels are assumed to be composed of multiple TRPC proteins. However, the cellular principles governing the assembly of TRPC proteins into homo- or heteromeric\nlinked to mental retardation. TRPC5 is a broadly expressed calcium channel with capability to act as an integrator of extracellular and intracellular signals at the level of calcium entry. The phospholipid-binding protein SESTD1 is a novel regulator of the transient receptor potential channels TRPC4 and TRPC5. TRPC4 and TRPC5 are two closely related members of the mammalian transient receptor potential cation channel family that have been implicated in important physiological functions, such as growth cone guidance and smooth muscle contraction. To further unravel the role of TRPC4 and TRPC5 in these processes in vivo, detailed information about the molecular composition of native channel complexes and their association with cellular signaling networks is needed. We therefore searched a human aortic cDNA library for novel TRPC4-interacting proteins using a modified yeast two-hybrid assay. This screen identified SESTD1, a previously uncharacterized protein containing a lipid-binding SEC14-like domain as well as spectrin-type cytoskeleton interaction\nindicator dye or by recording membrane current under voltage clamp. TRPC5 activity could be evoked by carbachol acting at muscarinic receptors, lanthanum, or a reducing agent. However, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) and diethylamine NONOate (DEA-NONOate) failed to stimulate or inhibit TRPC5 at concentrations that generated nitric oxide, caused vasorelaxation, or suppressed activity of TRPC6 via protein kinase G. At high concentrations, SNAP (but not DEA-NONOate) occasionally stimulated TRPC5 but the effect was confounded by background TRPC5-independent Ca(2+) signals. Endogenous Ca(2+)-entry in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) was suppressed by SNAP; TRPC5 blocking antibody or dominant-negative mutant TRPC5 suppressed this Ca(2+) entry and occluded the effect of SNAP. The data suggest that nitric oxide is not a direct modulator of homomeric TRPC5 channels but may inhibit endogenous BAEC channels that contain TRPC5. A sphingosine-1-phosphate-activated calcium channel controlling vascular smooth muscle cell motility. In a screen of potential lipid regulators of transient receptor potential\nTRPC5. Human canonical transient receptor potential channel 5 (TRPC5) has been cloned from the Xq23 region on chromosome X as a suspect in nonsyndromic mental retardation. TRPC5 is a Ca(2+)-permeable cation channel predominantly expressed in the CNS, including the hippocampus, cerebellum, amygdala, sensory neurons, and retina. It also shows more restricted expression in the periphery, notably in the kidney and cardiovascular system. Homotetrameric TRPC5 channels are primarily activated by receptors coupled to Gq and phospholipase C and/or Gi proteins, but TRPC5 channels may also gate in a store-dependent manner, which requires other partner proteins such TRPC1, STIM1, and Orai1. There is an impressive array of other activators of TRPC5 channels, such as nitric oxide, lysophospholipids, sphingosine-1-phosphate, reduced thioredoxin, protons, lanthanides, and calcium, and many can cause its direct activation. Moreover, TRPC5 shows constitutive activity, and it is responsive to membrane stretch and cold. Thus, TRPC5 channels have significant potential for\nsphingosine-1-phosphate-activated calcium channel controlling vascular smooth muscle cell motility. In a screen of potential lipid regulators of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, we identified sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) as an activator of TRPC5. We explored the relevance to vascular biology because S1P is a key cardiovascular signaling molecule. TRPC5 is expressed in smooth muscle cells of human vein along with TRPC1, which forms a complex with TRPC5. Importantly, S1P also activates the TRPC5-TRPC1 heteromultimeric channel. Because TRPC channels are linked to neuronal growth cone extension, we considered a related concept for smooth muscle. We find S1P stimulates smooth muscle cell motility, and that this is inhibited by E3-targeted anti-TRPC5 antibody. Ion permeation involving TRPC5 is crucial because S1P-evoked motility is also suppressed by the channel blocker 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate or a TRPC5 ion-pore mutant. S1P acts on TRPC5 via two mechanisms, one extracellular and one intracellular, consistent with its bipolar signaling functions. The\nwild-type and mutant TRPC5 using co-immunoprecipitation and FRET method, indicating a weak interaction between dimeric partners. These results indicated that the disulfide bond between conserved extracellular cysteines, especially C553, is essential for functional TRPC5 activity by channel multimerization and trafficking. Selective G\u03b1i subunits as novel direct activators of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC)4 and TRPC5 channels. The ubiquitous transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels function as non-selective, Ca(2+)-permeable channels and mediate numerous cellular functions. It is commonly assumed that TRPC channels are activated by stimulation of G\u03b1(q)-PLC-coupled receptors. However, whether the G\u03b1(q)-PLC pathway is the main regulator of TRPC4/5 channels and how other G\u03b1 proteins may regulate these channels are poorly understood. We previously reported that TRPC4/TRPC5 can be activated by G\u03b1(i). In the current work, we found that G\u03b1(i) subunits, rather than G\u03b1(q), are the primary and direct activators of TRPC4 and TRPC5. We report a novel molecular mechanism\nsensing dietary fatty acids and regulating adiponectin. RATIONALE: Calcium entry is pivotal in the heart and blood vessels, but its significance and mechanisms in adipose tissue are largely unknown. An important factor produced by adipocytes is adiponectin, which confers myocardial protection, insulin-sensitization, and antiatherosclerotic effects.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relevance of calcium channels to adipocytes and the production of adiponectin.METHODS AND RESULTS: Microarray analysis led to identification of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC)1 and TRPC5 as channel subunits that are induced when adipocytes mature. Both subunits were found in perivascular fat of patients with atherosclerosis. Intracellular calcium and patch-clamp measurements showed that adipocytes exhibit constitutively active calcium-permeable nonselective cationic channels that depend on TRPC1 and TRPC5. The activity could be enhanced by lanthanum or rosiglitazone, known stimulators of TRPC5 and TRPC5-containing channels. Screening identified lipid modulators of the channels that are relevant to adipose biology. Dietary \u03c9-3 fatty acids (eg, \u03b1-linolenic\nHuntington's disease. Aberrant glutathione or Ca(2+) homeostasis due to oxidative stress is associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. The Ca(2+)-permeable transient receptor potential cation (TRPC) channel is predominantly expressed in the brain, which is sensitive to oxidative stress. However, the role of the TRPC channel in neurodegeneration is not known. Here, we report a mechanism of TRPC5 activation by oxidants and the effect of glutathionylated TRPC5 on striatal neurons in Huntington's disease. Intracellular oxidized glutathione leads to TRPC5 activation via TRPC5 S-glutathionylation at Cys176/Cys178 residues. The oxidized glutathione-activated TRPC5-like current results in a sustained increase in cytosolic Ca(2+), activated calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and the calpain-caspase pathway, ultimately inducing striatal neuronal cell death. We observed an abnormal glutathione pool indicative of an oxidized state in the striatum of Huntington's disease transgenic (YAC128) mice. Increased levels of endogenous TRPC5 S-glutathionylation were observed in the striatum in both transgenic mice and patients\npotential classical or canonical 4 (TRPC4) and TRPC5 channels are members of the classical or canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channel family of non-selective cation channels. TRPC4 and TRPC5 channels are widely accepted as receptor-operated cation channels that are activated in a phospholipase C-dependent manner, following the Gq/11 protein-coupled receptor activation. However, their precise activation mechanism has remained largely elusive for a long time, as the TRPC4 and TRPC5 channels were considered as being insensitive to the second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) in contrast to the other TRPC channels. Recent findings indicate that the C-terminal interactions with the scaffolding proteins Na\u207a/H\u207a exchanger regulatory factor 1 and 2 (NHERF1 and NHERF2) dynamically regulate the DAG sensitivity of the TRPC4 and TRPC5 channels. Interestingly, the C-terminal NHERF binding suppresses, while the dissociation of NHERF enables, the DAG sensitivity of the TRPC4 and TRPC5 channels. This leads to the assumption that all of the\nmutant. S1P acts on TRPC5 via two mechanisms, one extracellular and one intracellular, consistent with its bipolar signaling functions. The extracellular effect appears to have a primary role in S1P-evoked cell motility. The data suggest S1P sensing by TRPC5 calcium channel is a mechanism contributing to vascular smooth muscle adaptation. A TRPC5-regulated calcium signaling pathway controls dendrite patterning in the mammalian brain. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels have been implicated as sensors of diverse stimuli in mature neurons. However, developmental roles for TRP channels in the establishment of neuronal connectivity remain largely unexplored. Here, we identify an essential function for TRPC5, a member of the canonical TRP subfamily, in the regulation of dendrite patterning in the mammalian brain. Strikingly, TRPC5 knockout mice harbor long, highly branched granule neuron dendrites with impaired dendritic claw differentiation in the cerebellar cortex. In vivo RNAi analyses suggest that TRPC5 regulates dendrite morphogenesis in the\ntransgenic (YAC128) mice. Increased levels of endogenous TRPC5 S-glutathionylation were observed in the striatum in both transgenic mice and patients with Huntington's disease. Both knockdown and inhibition of TRPC5 significantly attenuated oxidation-induced striatal neuronal cell death. Moreover, a TRPC5 blocker improved rearing behaviour in Huntington's disease transgenic mice and motor behavioural symptoms in littermate control mice by increasing striatal neuron survival. Notably, low levels of TRPC1 increased the formation of TRPC5 homotetramer, a highly Ca(2+)-permeable channel, and stimulated Ca(2+)-dependent apoptosis in Huntington's disease cells (STHdh(Q111/111)). Taken together, these novel findings indicate that increased TRPC5 S-glutathionylation by oxidative stress and decreased TRPC1 expression contribute to neuronal damage in the striatum and may underlie neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease. Opposite regulatory effects of TRPC1 and TRPC5 on neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. The transient receptor potential (TRPC) family of Ca\u00b2\u207a permeable, non-selective cation channels is abundantly expressed in the brain, and can function\nThe channel has voltage dependence but the biological significance of this is unknown; it is partially due to intracellular magnesium blockade at aspartic acid residue 633. Protein partners include calmodulin, CaBP1, enkurin, Na(+)-H+ exchange regulatory factor (NHERF) and stathmin. TRPC5 is included in local vesicular trafficking regulated by growth factors through phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3-kinase, Rac1 and PIP-5-kinase. Inhibition of myosin light chain kinase suppresses TRPC5, possibly via an effect on trafficking. Biological roles of TRPC5 are emerging but more reports on this aspect are needed. One proposed role is as a mediator of calcium entry and excitation in smooth muscle, another as an inhibitor of neuronal growth cone extension. The latter is intriguing in view of the original cloning of the human TRPC5 gene from a region of the X chromosome linked to mental retardation. TRPC5 is a broadly expressed calcium channel with capability to act as an integrator of extracellular\nfunction for TRPC5 that couples calcium signaling to a ubiquitin ligase pathway at the centrosome and thereby orchestrates dendrite patterning and connectivity in the brain. E3-targeted anti-TRPC5 antibody inhibits store-operated calcium entry in freshly isolated pial arterioles. Smooth muscle cells in arterioles have pivotal roles in the determination of blood pressure and distribution of local blood flow. The cells exhibit calcium entry in response to passive store depletion, but the mechanisms and relevance of this phenomenon are poorly understood. Previously, a role for canonical transient receptor potential 1 (TRPC1) was indicated, but heterologous expression studies showed TRPC1 to have poor function in isolation, suggesting a requirement for additional proteins. Here we test the hypothesis that TRPC5 is such an additional protein, because TRPC5 forms heteromultimeric channels with TRPC1, and RNA encoding TRPC5 is present in arterioles. Recordings were from arteriolar fragments freshly isolated from rabbit pial membrane. Ionic current in\nsubunits, rather than G\u03b1(q), are the primary and direct activators of TRPC4 and TRPC5. We report a novel molecular mechanism in which TRPC4 is activated by several G\u03b1(i) subunits, most prominently by G\u03b1(i2), and TRPC5 is activated primarily by G\u03b1(i3). Activation of G\u03b1(i) by the muscarinic M2 receptors or expression of the constitutively active G\u03b1(i) mutants equally and fully activates the channels. Moreover, both TRPC4 and TRPC5 are activated by direct interaction of their conserved C-terminal SESTD (SEC14-like and spectrin-type domains) with the G\u03b1(i) subunits. Two amino acids (lysine 715 and arginine 716) of the TRPC4 C terminus were identified by structural modeling as mediating the interaction with G\u03b1(i2). These findings indicate an essential role of G\u03b1(i) proteins as novel activators for TRPC4/5 and reveal the molecular mechanism by which G-proteins activate the channels.

Screening identified lipid modulators of the channels that are relevant to adipose biology. Dietary \u03c9-3 fatty acids (eg, \u03b1-linolenic acid) were inhibitory at concentrations that are achieved by ingestion. The adipocyte TRPC1/TRPC5-containing channel was functionally negative for the generation of adiponectin because channel blockade by antibodies, knock-down of TRPC1-TRPC5 in vitro, or conditional disruption of calcium permeability in TRPC5-incorporating channels in vivo increased the generation of adiponectin. The previously recognized capability of \u03b1-linolenic acid to stimulate the generation of adiponectin was lost when calcium permeability in the channels was disrupted.CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that TRPC1 and TRPC5 contribute a constitutively active heteromultimeric channel of adipocytes that negatively regulates adiponectin and through which \u03c9-3 fatty acids enhance the anti-inflammatory adipokine, adiponectin. Increased TRPC5 glutathionylation contributes to striatal neuron loss in Huntington's disease. Aberrant glutathione or Ca(2+) homeostasis due to oxidative stress is associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. The\ntransient receptor potential (TRPC) family of Ca\u00b2\u207a permeable, non-selective cation channels is abundantly expressed in the brain, and can function as store-operated (SOC) and store-independent channels depending on their interaction with the ER Ca\u00b2\u207a sensor STIM1. TRPC1 and TRPC5 have critical roles in neurite outgrowth, however which of their functions regulate neurite outgrowth is unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of TRPC channels and their STIM1-induced SOC activity on neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. We report that PC12 cell differentiation down-regulates TRPC5 expression, whereas TRPC1 expression is retained. TRPC1 and TRPC5 interact with STIM1 through the STIM1 ERM domain. Transfection of TRPC1 and TRPC5 increased the receptor-activated Ca\u00b2\u207a influx that was markedly augmented by the co-expression of STIM1. Topical expression of TRPC1 in PC12 cells markedly increased neurite outgrowth while that of TRPC5 suppressed neurite outgrowth. Suppression of neurite outgrowth by TRPC5 requires the channel function of TRPC5.\noutgrowth by TRPC1 is independent of Ca\u00b2\u207a influx and TRPC1-promoted neurite outgrowth depends on the surface expression of TRPC1. It is likely that TRPC1 acts as a scaffold at the cell surface to assemble a signaling complex to stimulate neurite outgrowth. Extracellular disulfide bridges stabilize TRPC5 dimerization, trafficking, and activity. Crucial cysteine residues can be involved in the modulation of protein activity via the modification of thiol (-SH) groups. Among these reactions, disulfide bonds (S-S) play a key role in the folding, stability, and activity of membrane proteins. However, the regulation of extracellular cysteines in classical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels remains controversial. Here, we examine the functional importance of the extracellular disulfide bond in TRPC5 in modulating channel gating and trafficking. Specifically, we investigated TRPC5 activity in transiently transfected HEK293 cells with wild-type (WT) or cysteine (C553 and C558) mutants in the pore loop. Using reducing agents, we determined\ncontrol of axon guidance and vascular smooth muscle cell migration and contractility. Recent studies of Trpc5 gene knockouts begin to uncover its roles in fear, anxiety, seizures, and cold sensing. Nitric oxide lacks direct effect on TRPC5 channels but suppresses endogenous TRPC5-containing channels in endothelial cells. TRPC5 is a member of the canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) family of proteins that forms cationic channels either through homomultimeric assembly or heteromultimeric coordination with other TRPC proteins. It is expressed in a variety of cells including central neurones and endothelial cells and has susceptibility to stimulation by multiple factors. Here we investigated if TRPC5 is sensitive to nitric oxide. Mouse TRPC5 or human TRPC5 was over-expressed in HEK293 cells, and TRPC5 activity was determined by measuring the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration with an indicator dye or by recording membrane current under voltage clamp. TRPC5 activity could be evoked by carbachol acting at muscarinic",

Identification and characterization of an escorter for two secretory adhesins in Toxoplasma gondii. The intracellular protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii shares with other members of the Apicomplexa a common set of apical structures involved in host cell invasion. Micronemes are apical secretory organelles releasing their contents upon contact with host cells. We have identified a transmembrane micronemal protein MIC6, which functions as an escorter for the accurate targeting of two soluble proteins MIC1 and MIC4 to the micronemes.

Although essential for apicomplexan invasion, the regulatory cascade and protein\u2013protein interactions that mediate host cell detection and engage rhoptry secretion remain poorly understood. Microneme proteins contribute to gliding motility, which supports displacement of parasites in tissues and invasion of host cells. Invasion additionally requires rhoptry discharge. Ca2+ signaling stimulates microneme fusion with the plasma membrane at the apical end of parasites to release proteins that perforate the host cell membrane, interact with the extracellular milieu, and bind host cell proteins (Carruthers & Sibley, ; Bisio & Soldati\u2010Favre, ; Dubois & Soldati\u2010Favre, ). Many microneme proteins remain tethered to the parasite's plasma membrane following secretion and act as adhesins that allow parasites to bind host cells (Tomley & Soldati, ; Cowman et al, ; Fr\u00e9nal et al, ). Some micronemal adhesins enable gliding motility by coupling the parasite's actomyosin system to the host\ndomains. NcMIC3 is a prominent component of Triton X-100 lysates of tachyzoites, and cosedimentation assays employing prefixed Vero cells showed that the protein binds to the Vero cell surface. In addition, the EGF-like domains, expressed as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli, also interacted with the Vero cell surface, while binding of NcSRS2 and NcSAG1, the major immunodominant surface antigens, was not as efficient. Our data are indicative of a functional role of NcMIC3 in host cell infection. Microneme Proteins 1 and 4 From Toxoplasma gondii Induce IL-10 Production by Macrophages Through TLR4 Endocytosis The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii modulates host cell responses to favor its success in the early stage of infections by secreting proteins from its apical organelles.

The TgMIC4-MIC1-MIC6 complex was the first to be identified in T. gondii and has been recently shown to be critical in invasion. This study establishes that the N-terminal thrombospondin type I repeat-like domains (TSR1-like) from TgMIC1 function as an independent adhesin as well as promoting association with TgMIC4. Using the newly solved three-dimensional structure of the C-terminal domain of TgMIC1 we have identified a novel Galectin-like fold that does not possess carbohydrate binding properties and redefines the architecture of TgMIC1. Instead, the TgMIC1 Galectin-like domain interacts and stabilizes TgMIC6, which provides the basis for a highly specific quality control mechanism for successful exit from the early secretory compartments and for subsequent trafficking of the complex to the micronemes.

The parasites were then spun down (4\u00b0C, 1,000 g, 5 min) and the ESA\u2010containing supernatant was pipetted into a protein LoBind tube. The supernatant was then spun down and the supernatant removed a second time to a new protein LoBind tube to ensure removal of all parasites. During the zaprinast incubation, the remaining parasites not used for generation of the ESAs were spun down and lysed by resuspension in Ringer's containing 0.8% Igepal CA\u2010630 (155 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 3 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM HEPES,\nof profilin in activating TLR11 and TLR12. This activation results in release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12. The ability to induce IL-12 secretion via TLR activation has been attributed to other T. gondii components, including glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors and heat shock protein 70 (TgHSP70). Granule dense proteins (GRA) 24 account for cytokine release by macrophages, which occurs through a TLR-independent pathway. Finally, our laboratory has shown that the complex LAC+, containing the microneme proteins (MICs) 1, 4, and 6 from T. gondii induce cytokine release by innate immune cells, which was later confirmed to be happening due to the interaction of MIC1 and MIC4 with both TLR2 and TLR4. We and others have previously reported that MIC1 and MIC4 possess lectin domains that recognize oligosaccharides with terminal \u03b1 -sialyl residues linked to \u03b2-galactosides (MIC1) or terminal \u03b2(1\u20134)- or \u03b2(1\u20133)-galactose (MIC4).

Some micronemal adhesins enable gliding motility by coupling the parasite's actomyosin system to the host cell surface or extracellular matrix. Adhesion complexes are translocated rearward along the parasite surface to produce forward motility (Fr\u00e9nal et al, ). Some microneme proteins have dedicated roles during invasion; the T. gondii microneme protein MIC8 and the P. falciparum proteins EBA175, Ripr, and CyRPA are species\u2010specific microneme proteins required for rhoptry effector secretion, but not parasite motility (Kessler et al, ; Singh et al, ; Volz et al, ; Knuepfer et al, ). Other proteins, like the microneme\u2010associate CRMP complex are required for rhoptry secretion and found across apicomplexans and even in free\u2010living ciliate secretion systems (Sparvoli et al, ; Singer et al, ). After secretion, some rhoptry effectors rewire host cell signaling to suppress innate immune responses, while other effectors, notably the components of the rhoptry neck (RON)\ncells transfected with TLR2 glycomutants were selectively unresponsive to MICs. Following in vitro infection, parasites lacking MIC1 or MIC4, as well as expressing MIC proteins with point mutations in their CRD, failed to induce wild-type (WT) levels of IL-12 secretion by innate immune cells. However, only MIC1 was shown to impact systemic levels of IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 in vivo. Together, our data show that MIC1 and MIC4 interact physically with TLR2 and TLR4 N-glycans to trigger IL-12 responses, and MIC1 is playing a significant role in vivo by altering T. gondii infection competency and murine pathogenesis.

Model of the topology for\nparasites of the phylum Apicomplexa. Regulated protein secretion from micronemes and host cell invasion are inextricably linked and essential processes for the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. TgM2AP is a propeptide-containing microneme protein found in a heterohexameric complex with the microneme protein TgMIC2, a protein that has a demonstrated fundamental role in gliding motility and invasion. TgM2AP function is also central to these processes, because disruption of TgM2AP (m2apKO) results in secretory retention of TgMIC2, leading to reduced TgMIC2 secretion from the micronemes and impaired invasion. Because the TgM2AP propeptide is predicted to be processed in an intracellular site near where TgMIC2 is retained in m2apKO parasites, we hypothesized that the propeptide and its proteolytic removal influence trafficking and secretion of the complex. We found that proTgM2AP traffics through endosomal compartments and that deletion of the propeptide leads to defective trafficking of the complex within or near this site, resulting in",

Brain monoamines include common biogenic amines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin) and trace amines [beta-phenylethylamine (beta-PEA), tyramine, tryptamine, and octopamine]. Common biogenic amines are well established as neurotransmitters, but the roles and functional importance of trace amines remain elusive. Here, we re-evaluated the interaction of trace amines with trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and investigated effects of beta-PEA on monoamine transporter function and influence of monoamine autoreceptors on TAAR1 signaling. We confirmed that TAAR1 was activated by trace amines and demonstrated that TAAR1 activation by beta-PEA significantly inhibited uptake and induced efflux of [3H]dopamine, [3H]norepinephrine, and [3H]serotonin in transfected cells.

The effect of beta-PEA on efflux was blocked by transporter inhibitors in either the transfected cells or wild-type mouse synaptosomes. We also demonstrated that TAAR1 signaling was not affected by monoamine autoreceptors at exposure to trace amines that we show to have poor binding affinity for the autoreceptors relative to common biogenic amines. These results reveal that beta-PEA alters monoamine transporter function via interacting with TAAR1 but not monoamine autoreceptors. The functional profile of beta-PEA may reveal a common mechanism by which trace amines exert modulatory effects on monoamine transporters in brain.",

        "desc": "Long QT and ventricular arrhythmias in transgenic mice expressing the N terminus and first transmembrane segment of a voltage-gated potassium channel. Voltage-gated potassium channels control cardiac repolarization, and mutations of K+ channel genes recently have been shown to cause arrhythmias and sudden death in families with the congenital long QT syndrome. The precise mechanism by which the mutations lead to QT prolongation and arrhythmias is uncertain, however. We have shown previously that an N-terminal fragment including the first transmembrane segment of the rat delayed rectifier K+ channel Kv1.1 (Kv1.1N206Tag) coassembles with other K+ channels of the Kv1 subfamily in vitro, inhibits the currents encoded by Kv1.5 in a dominant-negative manner when coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes, and traps Kv1.5 polypeptide in the endoplasmic reticulum of GH3 cells. Here we report that transgenic mice overexpressing Kv1.1N206Tag in the heart have a prolonged QT interval and ventricular tachycardia. Cardiac myocytes from these mice\ntransgenic mice overexpressing Kv1.1N206Tag in the heart have a prolonged QT interval and ventricular tachycardia. Cardiac myocytes from these mice have action potential prolongation caused by a significant reduction in the density of a rapidly activating, slowly inactivating, 4-aminopyridine sensitive outward K+ current. These changes correlate with a marked decrease in the level of Kv1.5 polypeptide. Thus, overexpression of a truncated K+ channel in the heart alters native K+ channel expression and has profound effects on cardiac excitability. Genetic variation in KCNA5: impact on the atrial-specific potassium current IKur in patients with lone atrial fibrillation. AIMS: Genetic factors may be important in the development of atrial fibrillation (AF) in the young. KCNA5 encodes the potassium channel \u03b1-subunit KV1.5, which underlies the voltage-gated atrial-specific potassium current IKur. KCNAB2 encodes KV\u03b22, a \u03b2-subunit of KV1.5, which increases IKur. Three studies have identified loss-of-function mutations in KCNA5 in patients with idiopathic AF. We\nKCNE2 effects on Kv1.5 voltage dependence and gating kinetics. In contrast, Testin did not prevent KCNE2 regulation of KCNQ1 gating. The data identify a novel role for Testin as a tertiary ion channel regulatory protein. Future studies will address the potential role for KCNE2-Testin interactions in arterial and myocyte physiology and CAD. Amino-terminal determinants of U-type inactivation of voltage-gated K+ channels. The T1 domain is a cytosolic NH2-terminal domain present in all Kv (voltage-dependent potassium) channels, and is highly conserved between Kv channel subfamilies. Our characterization of a truncated form of Kv1.5 (Kv1.5deltaN209) expressed in myocardium demonstrated that deletion of the NH2 terminus of Kv1.5 imparts a U-shaped inactivation-voltage relationship to the channel, and prompted us to investigate the NH2 terminus as a regulatory site for slow inactivation of Kv channels. We examined the macroscopic inactivation properties of several NH2-terminal deletion mutants of Kv1.5 expressed in HEK 293 cells, demonstrating\nchannel subunits that lack protein-protein binding motifs become targeted and covalently modified by cellular signaling enzymes. Here, we show that Src-family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) bind to heteromultimeric Shaker-family voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels by interactions between the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain and the proline-rich SH3 domain ligand sequence in the Shaker-family subunit Kv1.5. Once bound to Kv1.5, Src-family PTKs phosphorylate adjacent subunits in the Kv channel heteromultimer that lack proline-rich SH3 domain ligand sequences. This SH3-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation contributes to significant suppression of voltage-evoked currents flowing through the heteromultimeric channel. These results demonstrate that Kv1.5 subunits function as SH3-dependent adaptor proteins that marshal Src-family kinases to heteromultimeric potassium channel signaling complexes, and thereby confer functional sensitivity upon coassembled channel subunits that are themselves not bound directly to Src-family kinases by allowing their phosphorylation. This is a mechanism for information transfer between subunits in heteromultimeric ion channels that is likely\nfibrillation, lacking traditional risk factors, were evaluated. Genomic DNA scanning revealed a nonsense mutation in KCNA5 that encodes Kv1.5, a voltage-gated potassium channel expressed in human atria. The heterozygous E375X mutation, present in a familial case of atrial fibrillation and absent in 540 unrelated control individuals, introduced a premature stop codon disrupting the Kv1.5 channel protein. The truncation eliminated the S4-S6 voltage sensor, pore region and C-terminus, preserving the N-terminus and S1-S3 transmembrane domains that secure tetrameric subunit assembly. Heterologously expressed recombinant E375X mutant failed to generate the ultrarapid delayed rectifier current I(Kur) vital for atrial repolarization and exerted a dominant-negative effect on wild-type current. Loss of channel function translated into action potential prolongation and early after-depolarization in human atrial myocytes, increasing vulnerability to stress-provoked triggered activity. The pathogenic link between compromised Kv1.5 function and susceptibility to atrial fibrillation was verified, at the organism level, in a murine model. Rescue\ndependent fast potassium channel Kv1.1, which is expressed at appreciable levels. The second ortholog is similar to Kv1.5 but has fewer N-terminal amino acids than other species. The sequence for Kv1.5 in the skate is very strongly aligned with the recently reported sequence for potassium channels in the electroreceptors of the cat shark, S. retifer, which also modulate synaptic transmission. The latter channel was designated as Kv1.3 in the initial report, but we suggest that these channels are actually orthologs of each other, and that Kv1.5 is the prevailing designation. We also found a beta subunit sequence (Kcnab2) which may co-assemble with one or both of the voltage gated channels. The new channels and subunits were verified by RT-PCR and the Kv1.1 sequence was confirmed by cloning. We also searched the RNA-seq repository for accessory subunits of Kcnma1, and found a computer-generated assembly that contained a complete sequence of its\nbetween compromised Kv1.5 function and susceptibility to atrial fibrillation was verified, at the organism level, in a murine model. Rescue of the genetic defect was achieved by aminoglycoside-induced translational read-through of the E375X premature stop codon, restoring channel function. This first report of Kv1.5 loss-of-function channelopathy establishes KCNA5 mutation as a novel risk factor for repolarization deficiency and atrial fibrillation. Impact of ancillary subunits on ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels generate the outward K(+) ion currents that constitute the primary force in ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium channels comprise tetramers of pore-forming alpha subunits and, in probably most cases in vivo, ancillary or beta subunits that help define the properties of the Kv current generated. Ancillary subunits can be broadly categorized as cytoplasmic or transmembrane and can modify Kv channel trafficking, conductance, gating, ion selectivity, regulation, and pharmacology. Because of their often profound effects on Kv channel function, studies of\nsurface expression and channel gating. Voltage-dependent potassium channels (Kv) play a crucial role in the activation and proliferation of leukocytes. Kv channels are either homo- or hetero-oligomers. This composition modulates their surface expression and serves as a mechanism for regulating channel activity. Kv channel interaction with accessory subunits provides mechanisms for channels to respond to stimuli beyond changes in membrane potential. Here, we demonstrate that KCNE4 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E member 4), but not KCNE2, functions as an inhibitory Kv1.3 partner in leukocytes. Kv1.3 trafficking, targeting and activity are altered by the presence of KCNE4. KCNE4 decreases current density, slows activation, accelerates inactivation, increases cumulative inactivation, retains Kv1.3 in the ER and impairs channel targeting to lipid raft microdomains. KCNE4 associates with Kv1.3 in the ER and decreases the number of Kv1.3 channels at the cell surface, which diminishes cell excitability. Kv1.3 and KCNE4 are differentially regulated upon activation\ntheir functional impact on the ventricular action potential and design of specific current-targeted compounds. Here, we discuss current thinking and lines of experimentation aimed at resolving the complexities of the Kv channel complexes that repolarize the human ventricular myocardium. Interactions between the C-terminus of Kv1.5 and Kv\u03b2 regulate pyridine nucleotide-dependent changes in channel gating. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels are tetrameric assemblies of transmembrane Kv proteins with cytosolic N- and C-termini. The N-terminal domain of Kv1 proteins binds to \u03b2-subunits, but the role of the C-terminus is less clear. Therefore, we studied the role of the C-terminus in regulating Kv1.5 channel and its interactions with Kv\u03b2-subunits. When expressed in COS-7 cells, deletion of the C-terminal domain of Kv1.5 did not affect channel gating or kinetics. Coexpression of Kv1.5 with Kv\u03b23 increased current inactivation, whereas Kv\u03b22 caused a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of current activation. Inclusion of NADPH in the\nby allowing their phosphorylation. This is a mechanism for information transfer between subunits in heteromultimeric ion channels that is likely to underlie the generation of combinatorial signaling diversity in the control of cellular electrical excitability. Structural and functional characterization of Kv6.2 a new gamma-subunit of voltage-gated potassium channel. We have cloned and functionally expressed Kv6.2, a new member of the Kv6 subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channel subunits. The human Kv6.2 (KCNF2) gene was mapped at 18q22-18q23. Kv6.2 mRNA is preferentially expressed in rat and human myocard. Rat and human Kv6.2 subunits appear to be unable to form functional Kv channels in a heterologous expression system, but, when coexpressed with Kv2.1 alpha subunits, heteromultimeric Kv channels were formed mediating voltage-activated delayed-rectifier type outward currents. Their kinetics and conductance-voltage relationship were different from those mediated by homomultimeric Kv2.1 channels. Yeast two-hybrid reporter assays indicated that Kv6.2 amino-termini are able to interact specifically\nwere used to confirm phylogenetic inferences. Further research should focus on the subcellular locations of these channels, their gating behavior, and the effects of accessory subunits on gating. Heteromeric complexes of aldo-keto reductase auxiliary KV\u03b2 subunits (AKR6A) regulate sarcolemmal localization of KV1.5 in coronary arterial myocytes. Redox-sensitive potassium channels consisting of the voltage-gated K+ (KV) channel pore subunit KV1.5 regulate resting membrane potential and thereby contractility of vascular smooth muscle cells. Members of the KV1 family associate with cytosolic auxiliary \u03b2 subunits, which are members of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily (AKR6A subfamily). The Kv\u03b2 subunits have been proposed to regulate Kv1 gating via pyridine nucleotide cofactor binding. However, the molecular identity of KV\u03b2 subunits that associate with native KV1.5 channels in the vasculature is unknown. Here, we examined mRNA and protein expression of KV\u03b2 subunits and tested whether KV\u03b2 isoforms interact with KV1.5 channels in murine coronary arteries. We\nat risk and contribute to improved therapeutic approaches. KCNE2 is a functionally versatile, ubiquitously expressed potassium channel \u03b2 subunit associated with CAD and cardiac arrhythmia susceptibility in humans and mice. Here, to identify novel KCNE2 interaction partners, we employed yeast two-hybrid screening of adult and fetal human heart libraries using the KCNE2 intracellular C-terminal domain as bait. Testin (encoded by TES), an endothelial cell-expressed, CAD-associated, focal adhesion protein, was identified as a high-confidence interaction partner for KCNE2. We confirmed physical association between KCNE2 and Testin in vitro by co-immunoprecipitation. Whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology revealed that KCNE2 negative-shifts the voltage dependence and increases the rate of activation of the endothelial cell and cardiomyocyte-expressed Kv channel \u03b1 subunit, Kv1.5 in CHO cells, whereas Testin did not alter Kv1.5 function. However, Testin nullified KCNE2 effects on Kv1.5 voltage dependence and gating kinetics. In contrast, Testin did not prevent KCNE2 regulation of KCNQ1 gating.\nalso induces significant clustering of STIM2. Furthermore, activation of Notch attenuates whole cell K+ currents in KCNA5- and KCNA2-transfected cells. Together, these results suggest that Notch activation enhances CaSR-mediated increases in [Ca2+]cyt by enhancing store-operated Ca2+ entry and inhibits KCNA5/KV1.5 and KCNA2/KV1.2, ultimately leading to voltage-activated Ca2+ entry. Further studies of ion channels in the electroreceptor of the skate through deep sequencing, cloning and cross species comparisons. Our comparative studies seek to understand the structure and function of ion channels in cartilaginous fish that can detect very low voltage gradients in seawater. The principal channels of the electroreceptor include a calcium activated K channel whose \u03b1 subunit is Kcnma1, and a voltage-dependent calcium channel, Cacna1d. It has also been suggested based on physiological and pharmacological evidence that a voltage-gated K channel is present in the basal membranes of the receptor cells which modulates synaptic transmitter release. Large conductance calcium-activated K\nsurface expression and loss-of-function in patch-clamp studies, whereas E48G, A305T, and D322H showed preserved surface expression and gain-of-function for KV1.5.CONCLUSION: This study is the first to present gain-of-function mutations in KCNA5 in patients with early-onset lone AF. We identified three gain-of-function and three loss-of-function mutations. We report a high prevalence of variants in KCNA5 in these patients. This supports the hypothesis that both increased and decreased potassium currents enhance AF susceptibility. Four and a half LIM protein 1: a partner for KCNA5 in human atrium. AIMS: Protein-protein interactions are critical for the normal membrane trafficking, localization, and function of voltage-gated ion channels. In human heart, the Shaker-related voltage-gated K(+) channel KCNA5 alpha-subunit forms the major basis of an atrial-specific, ultra-rapid delayed rectifier K(+) current, I(Kur). We sought to identify proteins that interact with KCNA5 in human atrium and investigate their role in the I(Kur) complex.METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a glutathione-S-transferase\nand protein expression of KV\u03b2 subunits and tested whether KV\u03b2 isoforms interact with KV1.5 channels in murine coronary arteries. We detected KV\u03b21 (AKR6A3), KV\u03b22 (AKR6A5) and KV\u03b23 (AKR6A9) transcripts and KV\u03b21 and KV\u03b22 protein in left anterior descending coronary arteries by real time quantitative PCR and Western blot, respectively. In situ proximity ligation assays indicated abundant protein-protein interactions between KV1.5/KV\u03b21, KV1.5/KV\u03b22 and KV\u03b21/\u03b22 in coronary arterial myocytes. Confocal microscopy and membrane fractionation analyses suggest that arterial myocytes from KV\u03b22-null mice have reduced abundance of sarcolemmal KV1.5. Together, data suggest that in coronary arterial myocytes, KV1.5 channels predominantly associate with KV\u03b21 and KV\u03b22 proteins and that KV\u03b22 performs a chaperone function for KV1.5 channels in arterial myocytes, thereby facilitating Kv1\u03b1 trafficking and membrane localization. KCNE4 suppresses Kv1.3 currents by modulating trafficking, surface expression and channel gating. Voltage-dependent potassium channels (Kv) play a crucial role in the activation and proliferation of leukocytes.\nchannel is present in the basal membranes of the receptor cells which modulates synaptic transmitter release. Large conductance calcium-activated K channels (BK) are comprised of four \u03b1 subunits, encoded by Kcnma1 and modulatory \u03b2 subunits of the Kcnmb class. We recently cloned and published the skate Kcnma1 gene and most of Kcnmb4 using purified mRNA of homogenized electroreceptors. Bellono et al. have recently performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on purified mRNA from skate electroreceptors and found several ion channels including Kcnma1. We searched the Bellono et al. RNA-seq repository for additional channels and subunits. Our most significant findings are the presence of two Shaker type voltage dependent K channel sequences which are grouped together as isoforms in the data repository. The larger of these is a skate ortholog of the voltage dependent fast potassium channel Kv1.1, which is expressed at appreciable levels. The second ortholog is similar to Kv1.5 but has\nterminus of Kv1.5 to the transmembrane core of Kv2.1 decelerated Kv2.1 inactivation and abolished the U-shaped voltage dependence of inactivation normally observed in Kv2.1. These data suggest that intersubunit T1 domain interactions influence U-type inactivation in Kv1 channels, and suggest a generalized influence of the T1 domain on U-type inactivation between Kv channel subfamilies.\nthat a specific region of the C-terminus (Arg543-Val583) is required for Kv\u03b2 binding. These results suggest that the C-terminal domain of Kv1.5 interacts with \u03b2-subunits and that this interaction is essential for the differential regulation of Kv currents by oxidized and reduced nucleotides. Tetramerization domain mutations in KCNA5 affect channel kinetics and cause abnormal trafficking patterns. The activity of voltage-gated K(+) (K(V)) channels plays an important role in regulating pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) contraction, proliferation, and apoptosis. The highly conserved NH(2)-terminal tetramerization domain (T1) of K(V) channels is important for proper channel assembly, association with regulatory K(V) beta-subunits, and localization of the channel to the plasma membrane. We recently reported two nonsynonymous mutations (G182R and E211D) in the KCNA5 gene of patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, which localize to the T1 domain of KCNA5. To study the electrophysiological properties and expression patterns of the mutants compared with\nchannels. We examined the macroscopic inactivation properties of several NH2-terminal deletion mutants of Kv1.5 expressed in HEK 293 cells, demonstrating that deletion of residues up to the T1 boundary (Kv1.5deltaN19, Kv1.5deltaN91, and Kv1.5deltaN119) did not alter Kv1.5 inactivation, however, deletion mutants that disrupted the T1 structure consistently exhibited inactivation phenotypes resembling Kv1.5deltaN209. Chimeric constructs between Kv1.5 and the NH2 termini of Kv1.1 and Kv1.3 preserved the inactivation kinetics observed in full-length Kv1.5, again suggesting that the Kv1 T1 domain influences slow inactivation. Furthermore, disruption of intersubunit T1 contacts by mutation of residues Glu(131) and Thr(132) to alanines resulted in channels exhibiting a U-shaped inactivation-voltage relationship. Fusion of the NH2 terminus of Kv2.1 to the transmembrane segments of Kv1.5 imparted a U-shaped inactivation-voltage relationship to Kv1.5, whereas fusion of the NH2 terminus of Kv1.5 to the transmembrane core of Kv2.1 decelerated Kv2.1 inactivation and abolished the U-shaped voltage dependence of inactivation\nnumber of Kv1.3 channels at the cell surface, which diminishes cell excitability. Kv1.3 and KCNE4 are differentially regulated upon activation or immunosuppression in macrophages. Thus, lipopolysaccharide-induced activation increases Kv1.3 and KCNE4 mRNA, whereas dexamethasone triggers a decrease in Kv1.3 with no changes in KCNE4. The channelosome composition determines the activity and affects surface expression and membrane localization. Therefore, KCNE4 association might play a crucial role in controlling immunological responses. Our results indicate that KCNE ancillary subunits could be new targets for immunomodulation. The focal adhesion protein Testin modulates KCNE2 potassium channel \u03b2 subunit activity. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) typically kills more people globally each year than any other single cause of death. A better understanding of genetic predisposition to CAD and the underlying mechanisms will help to identify those most at risk and contribute to improved therapeutic approaches. KCNE2 is a functionally versatile, ubiquitously expressed potassium channel \u03b2 subunit associated",

Smad4 enhances Pemigatinib efficiency, and Smad4 knockdown results in Pemigatinib resistance. In conclusion, coexpression of Smad4 and MYO18A is a favorable prognostic indicator for iCCA and pCCA. The Smad4-MYO18A-PP1A complex dephosphorylates PAK1-T423 and thus inhibits \u03b2-catenin-S675 phosphorylation and its intranuclear localization. Smad4 suppresses CCA proliferation, migration, invasion, and sensitivity to Pemigatinib by governing the phosphorylation and intracellular localization of \u03b2-catenin. The Putative Roles and Functions of Indel, Repetition and Duplication Events in Alphavirus Non-Structural Protein 3 Hypervariable Domain (nsP3 HVD) in Evolution, Viability and Re-Emergence. Alphavirus non-structural proteins 1-4 (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4) are known to be crucial for alphavirus RNA replication and translation. To date, nsP3 has been demonstrated to mediate many virus-host protein-protein interactions in several fundamental alphavirus mechanisms, particularly during the early stages of replication. However, the molecular pathways and proteins\nprotein, ORF8, ORF8a, ORF9b, ORF14) found in the Y2H system eight could be confirmed by CoIP (nsp2, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14, E protein). Nsp 8 and nsp12 proteins interacted with ORF9b and nsp13, respectively, in both directions in the Y2H. This was also the case for the interaction between nsp14 and ORF9b, which could also be confirmed by CoIP. Interactions of structural proteins Of the \u201cclassical\u201d structural proteins S, E, M and N, only the E protein showed a number of interactions with the non-structural proteins nsp1, nsp8, nsp11, as well as with the accessory proteins ORF3b, ORF7b and ORF9b. Interestingly, M and S reacted with the only recently described accessory structural proteins ORF 3a and ORF7a. Self-interaction of the E protein was seen in both assays. The interaction between the structural proteins N and M, which has been described in two recent reports, was found positive by\nFour CoIPs were detected in both directions: non-structural proteins nsp12 (RdRNAP) and nsp13 (C/H, NTPAse, dNTPAse, 5\u2032- to 3\u2032 RNA helicase, DNA Helicase, RNA 5\u2032- triphosphatase), nsp8 and accessory protein ORF9b, nsp14 (C/H, 3\u2032- to 5\u2032 exoribonuclease) and ORF9b, and accessory proteins ORF8a and ORF8b. Six of the proteins, including nsp7, nsp8, nsp13, \u201cE\u201d, ORF9b and ORF14 interacted with themselves indicating the formation of dimeric or multimeric complexes. Four of the self-interactions including nsp8, \u201cE\u201d, ORF9b and ORF14 self-interactions were also found in the CoIP assay. Two non-structural proteins nsp2 and nsp8, and the accessory protein ORF9b showed a rather large number of interactions (8, 14 and 15 interactions, respectively).

All ORFs were tested against each other. Positive interactions in yeast (black and grey squares) were retested by CoIP in mammalian cells (293cells) using anti- HA (preys) and anti-c-myc (baits) antibodies. Interactions tested positive in 293 cells by CoIP are encircled in red. Interactions of non-structural proteins Six interactions of the non-structural proteins nsp2 could be confirmed by CoIP including the non-structural proteins nsp3N, nsp6, nsp8, nsp11 and nsp16 and ORF 3a, which only recently had been described to be a novel structural protein. Figure 2A shows IP and CoIP results with anti-HA and anti-c-myc antibodies: 293 cells were transfected with HA-tagged nsp2 and c-myc-tagged nsp2-, nsp3N-, nsp6- or nsp8. The lysates were split into two and immunoprecipitated in the presence of protein G with the anti- HA (left\ncomplexes consist of intricate macromolecular structures in which many of the non-structural replicase proteins are involved. One of the most interesting interactor proteins found in our study is nsp8, which interacts with replicase proteins nsp2, nsp5, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14. The importance of this protein is supported by recently reported crystallization studies, which described the multimeric association of various of the non-strucutural proteins. Nsp 8 seems to be one of the proteins involved in these complexes. Nsp8 deletion or irreversible fusion to nsp7 or nsp 9 by mutagenesis of the corresponding cleavage site results in a lethal phenotype supporting the idea that nsp8 is absolutely essential for virus replication (Deming et al., submitted). Evidence has been presented for interaction with nsp9, a ssRNA-binding protein, by analytical ultracentrifugation experiments and by a decrease of the disorder of the nsp8 N-terminal region after the addition of nsp9. Furthermore, a\npredicted to encode 14 functional open reading frames, leading to the expression of up to 30 structural and non-structural protein products. The functions of a large number of viral ORFs are poorly understood or unknown. In order to gain more insight into functions and modes of action and interaction of the different proteins, we cloned the viral ORFeome and performed a genome-wide analysis for intraviral protein interactions and for intracellular localization. 900 pairwise interactions were tested by yeast-two-hybrid matrix analysis, and more than 65 positive non-redundant interactions, including six self interactions, were identified. About 38% of interactions were subsequently confirmed by CoIP in mammalian cells. Nsp2, nsp8 and ORF9b showed a wide range of interactions with other viral proteins. Nsp8 interacts with replicase proteins nsp2, nsp5, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14, indicating a crucial role as a major player within the replication complex machinery. It was shown\ndegradation (t 1/2 = 13 h) than its homodimers or monomers (t 1/2 < 20 min), indicating an evolutionary advantage of the more complex structure. The proteomic analysis of Pseudomyrmex penetrator venom and in-depth characterization of \u0394-PSDTX-Pp1a provide novel insights in the structural complexity of ant venom and further exemplifies how nature exploits disulfide-bond formation and dimerization to gain an evolutionary advantage via improved stability, a concept that is highly relevant for the design and development of peptide therapeutics, molecular probes, and bioinsecticides. Mutations at the palmitoylation site of non-structural protein nsP1 of Semliki Forest virus attenuate virus replication and cause accumulation of compensatory mutations. The replicase of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) consists of four non-structural proteins, designated nsP1-4, and is bound to cellular membranes via an amphipathic peptide and palmitoylated cysteine residues of nsP1. It was found that mutations preventing nsP1 palmitoylation also attenuated virus replication. The replacement of\ncomplex with PP1a using microcystin sepharose affinity purification, Using a lymphoblastoid cell line in which EBNA3C protein levels are conditional on hydroxytamoxifen, surprisingly, we found that (i) EBNA3C maintains phosphorylation of eIF2alpha at serine 51, and (ii) protects against ER stress induced activation of the unfolded protein response as measured by XBP1 (u) versus XBP1(s) protein expression and N-terminal ATF6 cleavage. In reporter assays, overexpression of Gadd34 enhances EBNA3C's ability to co-activate EBNA2 activation of the LMP1 promoter. Collectively the data suggest that EBNA3C interacts with Gadd34, activating the upstream component of the UPR (eIF2alpha phosphorylation) while preventing downstream UPR events (XBP1 activation and ATF6 cleavage). Non-structural proteins 2 and 3 interact to modify host cell membranes during the formation of the arterivirus replication complex.

The\ngenome containing the two overlapping ORF1a and ORF1b, which are connected by a ribosomal frameshift. The two polyproteins expressed are predicted to encode and to be cleaved by a papain-like proteinase 2 (PL-Pro = part of nsp3) and a 3C-like proteinase (3CL-Pro = nsp5) to 16 mature replicase proteins. They are well conserved between SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses. It is suggested that they are required for the synthesis of the full-length genome and subgenomic RNA synthesis as well as for virus replication. Functions of the processed proteins include a single-stranded RNA-binding protein (nsp9) an RNA-dependendent RNA polymerase (RdRp = nsp12) as well as a non-canonical RdRp (nsp8) synthesizing short primers for nsp12, a superfamily 1-like helicase (HEL1 = nsp13), and a uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU = nsp15). Nsp3, nsp14, nsp16 are thought to have ADP-ribose 1\u2032-phosphatase, 3\u2032->5\u2032 exonuclease and 2\u2032-O-ribose methyltransferase activities, respectively.

Crystal structure of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) papain-like protease bound to ubiquitin facilitates targeted disruption of deubiquitinating activity to demonstrate its role in innate immune suppression. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly emerging human pathogen that was first isolated in 2012. MERS-CoV replication depends in part on a virus-encoded papain-like protease (PL(pro)) that cleaves the viral replicase polyproteins at three sites releasing non-structural protein 1 (nsp1), nsp2, and nsp3. In addition to this replicative function, MERS-CoV PL(pro) was recently shown to be a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) and to possess deISGylating activity, as previously reported for\nRNA-RNA interaction with the TRSB upstream of each ORF and skipping of the viral genome in between them to produce individual sgRNAs. Abundance of individual sgRNAs and viral gRNA synthesized in the infected cells depend on the location and read-through efficiency of each TRSB. Although more studies are needed, the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has taught the world a painful lesson that is to invest and proactively prepare future emergence of other types of coronaviruses and any other possible biological horrors. The nsp9 replicase protein of SARS-coronavirus, structure and functional insights. As part of a high-throughput structural analysis of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) proteins, we have solved the structure of the non-structural protein 9 (nsp9). This protein, encoded by ORF1a, has no designated function but is most likely involved with viral RNA synthesis. The protein comprises a single beta-barrel with a fold previously unseen in single domain proteins. The fold superficially resembles an\nnon-structural proteins nsp2 and nsp8. 293 cells were infected with vaccinia virus vTF-7 and subsequently co-transfected with HA- and c-myc- tagged plasmids carrying the respective SARS-CoV ORFs. After 20 hours half of the cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA, the other half with anti- c-myc antibody. Bound proteins were subjected twice to 12,5% SDS-PAGE and Western Blot transfer, and probed cross-wise with the two antibodies. Co-precipitated proteins are indicated in the right panels. HA and c-myc tags are expressed as N-terminal fusions with the corresponding SARS-CoV ORF in plasmids pGADT7 and pGBKT7, respectively. Stars indicate expression products by IP, arrows by CoIP. The second-most connected protein of the replicase complex is nsp8 (figure 2A, 2B). Of the 14 interacting proteins (nsp2, nsp5, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14, E protein, ORF8, ORF8a, ORF9b, ORF14) found in the Y2H system eight could be confirmed by CoIP (nsp2, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9,\nthe replicase gene polyprotein of mouse hepatitis virus colocalize in the cell periphery and adjacent to sites of virion assembly.

Systematic subcellular localization\nthe experiments in Vero cells revealed that the C-terminal part of nsp2 interacts with nsp3. Most EAV nsps localize to virus-induced double-membrane structures in the perinuclear region of the infected cell, where virus RNA synthesis takes place. It is now shown that, in an expression system, the co-expression of nsp2 and nsp3 is both necessary and sufficient to induce the formation of double-membrane structures that strikingly resemble those found in infected cells. Thus, the nsp2 and nsp3 cleavage products play a crucial role in two processes that are common to positive-strand RNA viruses that replicate in mammalian cells: controlled proteolysis of replicase precursors and membrane association of the virus replication complex. Analysis of Intraviral Protein-Protein Interactions of the SARS Coronavirus ORFeome The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome is predicted to encode 14 functional open reading frames, leading to the expression of up to 30 structural and non-structural protein\nDBT-nsp2 (MHV) expressing cells. Many of the non-structural proteins are involved in the replication of the virus and locate to virus-induced cytoplasmic double-membrane vesicular complexes as the sites of viral replication. It is therefore important to take into account that the localization patterns of nsps might be quite different when expressed individually in cells as compared to the situation of viral infection where various viral proteins might help to recruit each other to the sites of active replication. Accessory protein 3a, for which a number of effects on cellular functions were described, we located in our Flag-tagged versions to the Golgi complex as Yuan et al. observed using EGFP-tagged constructs. As a structural protein ORF3a interacts with the M protein which was also clearly found in the Golgi as Flag fusion proteins. The nuclear localization of ORF3b is also reasonable because it induces cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase\nFor the elucidation of molecular mechanisms during the course of viral growth and propagation there is a need to systematically examine possible interactions of all viral proteins. We therefore cloned the SARS-CoV ORFeome by recombinatorial cloning (GATEWAY technology) and performed a genome-wide analysis for viral protein interactions by yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) matrix screen. Results Generation of a SARS-CoV ORFeome We have designed a set of nested PCR primers to amplify all viral non-structural, structural and accessory ORFs at the predicted protease cleavage sites or at the respective start and stop codons (Table 1). For cloning reasons, nsp3 was subdivided into a N-terminal (nsp3N, nt positions 2719\u20134431) and a C-terminal (nsp3C, nt positions 4885\u20138484) fragment containing the ADP-ribose-1\u201dmonophosphatase domain and the Papain-like proteinase, respectively. An accessory ORF14 described only by Marra et al. was also included. Primers were designed such that they contained gene-specific sequences for the amplification of the respective ORFs.\nnsp8. The lysates were split into two and immunoprecipitated in the presence of protein G with the anti- HA (left upper panel) or with the anti- c-myc (right upper panel) antibody. The bound proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE Western blot analysis. Expressed HA-tagged proteins are indicated by stars and coprecipitated proteins by arrows. Although the nature of the additional protein species with higher molecular weight in the anti-HA WB of the anti-c-myc CoIP is unclear, they might reflect a multimeric nsp2 band that is not present in the other lanes, further supporting the nsp2-nsp2 interaction. But they could also be a result of post-translational modification upon binding to other proteins. In the reciprocal analysis (lower left and right panel) nsp2 proteins coprecipitated with itself and with nsp3N. CoIPs of non-structural proteins nsp2 and nsp8. 293 cells were infected with vaccinia virus vTF-7 and subsequently co-transfected with HA- and c-myc-\nprocessing of the two precursor polyproteins of the viral replicase and are also thought to modulate host cell functions to facilitate infection. The papain-like protease 1 (PL1(pro)) domain is present in nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) of alphacoronaviruses and subgroup 2a betacoronaviruses. It participates in the proteolytic processing of the N-terminal region of the replicase polyproteins in a manner that varies among different coronaviruses and remains poorly understood. Here we report the first structural and biochemical characterization of a purified coronavirus PL1(pro) domain, that of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Its tertiary structure is compared with that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus PL2(pro), a downstream paralog that is conserved in the nsp3's of all coronaviruses. We identify both conserved and unique structural features likely controlling the interaction of PL1(pro) with cofactors and substrates, including the tentative mapping of substrate pocket residues. The purified recombinant TGEV PL1(pro) was shown to cleave",

The transport mechanism of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier. The mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier imports ADP from the cytosol and exports ATP from the mitochondrial matrix, which are key transport steps for oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotic organisms. The transport protein belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family, a large transporter family in the inner membrane of mitochondria. It is one of the best studied members of the family and serves as a paradigm for the molecular mechanism of mitochondrial carriers. Structurally, the carrier consists of three homologous domains, each composed of two transmembrane \u03b1-helices linked with a loop and short \u03b1-helix on the matrix side. The transporter cycles between a cytoplasmic and matrix state in which a central substrate binding site is alternately accessible to these compartments for binding of ADP or ATP.

Sequence analysis shows that MTCH2 is present in all examined multicellular Metazoa as well as unicellular Choanoflagellata, and is a highly derived member of the mitochondrial carrier family. Mitochondrial carriers are monomeric transport proteins that are usually found in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where they exchange small substrates between the mitochondrial matrix and intermembrane space. There are extensive differences between the protein sequences of MTCH2 and other mitochondrial carriers that may explain the ability of MTCH2 to associate with tBID and thus its role in apoptosis. We review the experimental evidence for the role of MTCH2 in apoptosis and suggest that the original transport function of the ancestral MTCH2 mitochondrial carrier has been co-opted by the apoptotic machinery to provide a receptor and signaling mechanism.

This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Mitochondrial Channels edited by Pierre Sonveaux, Pierre Maechler and Jean-Claude Martinou. The mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier exists and functions as a monomer. For more than 40 years, the oligomeric state of members of the mitochondrial carrier family (SLC25) has been the subject of debate. Initially, the consensus was that they were dimeric, based on the application of a large number of different techniques. However, the structures of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier, a member of the family, clearly demonstrated that its structural fold is monomeric, lacking a conserved dimerisation interface. A re-evaluation of previously published data, with the advantage of hindsight, concluded that technical errors were at the basis of the earlier dimer claims. Here, we revisit this topic, as new claims for the existence of dimers of the bovine ADP/ATP carrier have emerged using native mass spectrometry of mitochondrial membrane vesicles.\nin galactose due to a lack of substrate in de novo purine biosynthesis. GxG analysis highlights a buffering interaction between the iron transporter SLC25A37 (A37) and the poorly characterized SLC25A39 (A39). Mitochondrial metabolite profiling, organelle transport assays, and structure-guided mutagenesis identify A39 as critical for mitochondrial glutathione (GSH) import. Functional studies reveal that A39-mediated glutathione homeostasis and A37-mediated mitochondrial iron uptake operate jointly to support mitochondrial OXPHOS. Our work underscores the value of studying family-wide genetic interactions across different metabolic environments. Combinatorial Gene\u00d7Gene\u00d7Environment CRISPR screen targeting human SLC25 transporter family enables the identification of SLC25A39 in mitochondrial glutathione import and its coordination with mitochondrial iron import in supporting OXPHOS. Introduction The SLC25 family transporters play a critical role in shuttling metabolites into and out of mitochondria. The protein family is evolutionarily conserved in nearly all eukaryotes, only missing in a few, highly diverged eukaryotes such as Giardia lamblia and Encephalitozoon\nconventional mitochondrial carrier-like mechanism. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is an integral membrane protein found in the mitochondrial inner membrane of brown adipose tissue, and facilitates the process of non-shivering thermogenesis in mammals. Its activation by fatty acids, which overcomes its inhibition by purine nucleotides, leads to an increase in the proton conductance of the inner mitochondrial membrane, short-circuiting the mitochondrion to produce heat rather than ATP. Despite 40 years of intense research, the underlying molecular mechanism of UCP1 is still under debate. The protein belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family of transporters, which have recently been shown to utilise a domain-based alternating-access mechanism, cycling between a cytoplasmic and matrix state to transport metabolites across the inner membrane. Here, we review the protein properties of UCP1 and compare them to those of mitochondrial carriers. UCP1 has the same structural fold as other mitochondrial carriers and, in contrast to past claims, is\nnotably the ADP/ATP carrier (AAC), often demonstrated the importance of CL. Over the past decade, the significance of CL in the organization of components of the electron transport chain into higher order assemblies, termed respiratory supercomplexes, has been established. Another protein required for oxidative phosphorylation, AAC, has received comparatively little attention likely stemming from the fact that AACs were thought to function in isolation as either homodimers or monomers. Recently however, AACs have been demonstrated to interact with the respiratory supercomplex, other members of the mitochondrial carrier family, and the TIM23 translocon. Interestingly, many if not all of these interactions depend on CL. As the paradigm for the mitochondrial carrier family, these discoveries with AAC suggest that other members of this large group of important proteins may be more gregarious than anticipated. Moreover, it is proposed that AAC and perhaps additional members of the mitochondrial carrier family might represent downstream\nthan anticipated. Moreover, it is proposed that AAC and perhaps additional members of the mitochondrial carrier family might represent downstream targets of pathological states involving alterations in CL. Mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 (MTCH2): the recruitment and evolution of a mitochondrial carrier protein to a critical player in apoptosis. Recent studies report mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 (MTCH2) as a novel and uncharacterized protein that acts as a receptor-like protein for the truncated BH3-interacting domain death agonist (tBID) protein in the outer membrane of mitochondria. These studies, using mouse embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts as well as mice with a conditional knockout of MTCH2 in the liver, showed that deletion of MTCH2 hindered recruitment of tBID to the mitochondria with subsequent reductions in the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and apoptosis. Sequence analysis shows that MTCH2 is present in all examined multicellular Metazoa as well as unicellular Choanoflagellata, and\nmitochondrial GSH import is necessary for cell proliferation in vitro and red blood cell development in mice. Heterologous expression of an engineered bifunctional bacterial GSH biosynthetic enzyme (GshF) in mitochondria enables mitochondrial GSH production and ameliorates the metabolic and proliferative defects caused by its depletion. Finally, GSH availability negatively regulates SLC25A39 protein abundance, coupling redox homeostasis to mitochondrial GSH import in mammalian cells. Our work identifies SLC25A39 as an essential and regulated component of the mitochondrial GSH-import machinery. Cardiolipin, a critical determinant of mitochondrial carrier protein assembly and function. The ability of phospholipids to act as determinants of membrane protein structure and function is probably best exemplified by cardiolipin (CL), the signature phospholipid of mitochondria. Early efforts to reconstitute individual respiratory complexes and members of the mitochondrial carrier family, most notably the ADP/ATP carrier (AAC), often demonstrated the importance of CL. Over the past decade, the significance of CL in\nCombinatorial GxGxE CRISPR screen identifies SLC25A39 in mitochondrial glutathione transport linking iron homeostasis to OXPHOS The SLC25 carrier family consists of 53 transporters that shuttle nutrients and co-factors across mitochondrial membranes. The family is highly redundant and their transport activities coupled to metabolic state. Here, we use a pooled, dual CRISPR screening strategy that knocks out pairs of transporters in four metabolic states \u2014 glucose, galactose, OXPHOS inhibition, and absence of pyruvate \u2014 designed to unmask the inter-dependence of these genes. In total, we screen 63 genes in four metabolic states, corresponding to 2016 single and pair-wise genetic perturbations. We recover 19 gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions and 9 gene-by-gene (GxG) interactions. One GxE interaction hit illustrates that the fitness defect in the mitochondrial folate carrier (SLC25A32) KO cells is genetically buffered in galactose due to a lack of substrate in de novo purine biosynthesis. GxG analysis highlights a buffering interaction between\nan inner mitochondrial membrane protein known to transport glutathione in liver and kidney. After cotransfection of CHO cells, Bcl-2 was coimmunoprecipitated with OGC and this novel interaction was significantly enhanced by glutathione monoethyl ester. Similarly, recombinant Bcl-2 interacted with recombinant OGC in the presence of GSH. Bcl-2 and OGC cotransfection in CHO cells significantly increased the mitochondrial glutathione pool. Finally, the ability of Bcl-2 to protect CHO cells from apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide was significantly attenuated by the OGC inhibitor phenylsuccinate. These data suggest that GSH binding by Bcl-2 enhances its affinity for the OGC. Bcl-2 and OGC appear to act in a coordinated manner to increase the mitochondrial glutathione pool and enhance resistance of cells to oxidative stress. We conclude that regulation of mitochondrial glutathione transport is a principal mechanism by which Bcl-2 suppresses MOS. The transport mechanism of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier. The mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier imports\n(c-state) and matrix-open states (m-state) locked by two inhibitors bound at the solute binding site, carboxyatractyloside and bongkrekic acid respectively, highlighted a conserved alternating-access transport mechanism enabled by the conformational change upon solute binding at the central cavity. The high-level sequence homology and structural similarity among the SLC25 transporters enable both identification of solute-binding residues and prediction of the transporting solute based on the putative chemical groups. A major challenge for the systematic interrogation of SLC25 transporter functions and their metabolic regulations lies in the high level of redundancy within the family. For instance, 36 members are part of paralogous subgroups, including four ANT (exchanging ATP for ADP) and four calcium-binding mitochondrial carrier proteins SCaMCs (enabling net adenylate transport). Previously, in our genome-wide CRISPR screen in galactose, a low glucose condition designed to discover genes required for mitochondrial OXPHOS, none of the four ANTs scored as hits.

A novel route for ATP\na novel interaction between recombinant Bcl-2 and reduced glutathione (GSH), which was antagonized by either Bcl-2 homology-3 domain (BH3) mimetics or a BH3-only protein, recombinant Bim. These previous findings prompted us to investigate if this novel Bcl-2/GSH interaction might play a role in regulating mitochondrial glutathione transport. Incubation of primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) with the BH3 mimetic HA14-1 induced MOS and caused specific depletion of the mitochondrial glutathione pool. Bcl-2 was coimmunoprecipitated with GSH after chemical cross-linking in CGNs and this Bcl-2/GSH interaction was antagonized by preincubation with HA14-1. Moreover, both HA14-1 and recombinant Bim inhibited GSH transport into isolated rat brain mitochondria. To further investigate a possible link between Bcl-2 function and mitochondrial glutathione transport, we next examined if Bcl-2 associated with the 2-oxoglutarate carrier (OGC), an inner mitochondrial membrane protein known to transport glutathione in liver and kidney.

Glutathione (GSH) is a small-molecule thiol that is abundant in all eukaryotes and has key roles in oxidative metabolism1. Mitochondria, as the major site of oxidative reactions, must maintain sufficient levels of GSH to perform protective and biosynthetic functions2. GSH is synthesized exclusively in the cytosol, yet the molecular machinery involved in mitochondrial GSH import remains unknown. Here, using organellar proteomics and metabolomics approaches, we identify SLC25A39, a mitochondrial membrane carrier of unknown function, as a regulator of GSH transport into mitochondria. Loss of SLC25A39 reduces mitochondrial GSH import and abundance without affecting cellular GSH levels. Cells lacking both SLC25A39 and its paralogue SLC25A40 exhibit defects in the activity and stability of proteins containing iron-sulfur clusters. We find that mitochondrial GSH import is necessary for cell proliferation in vitro and red blood cell development in mice.

Follow-up studies combining mitochondrial metabolite profiling, organelle transport assay and structure-guided mutagenesis identified a critical role of SLC25A39 in mitochondrial glutathione uptake, a discovery that has also been independently reached by a recent report. The buffering genetic interaction revealed from our CRISPR screen allowed further extending the finding by demonstrating a functional coordination of mitochondrial glutathione uptake (mediated by SLC25A39) and mitochondrial iron import (mediated by SLC25A37) in supporting OXPHOS.

UCP1 has the same structural fold as other mitochondrial carriers and, in contrast to past claims, is a monomer, binding one purine nucleotide and three cardiolipin molecules tightly. The protein has a single substrate binding site, which is similar to those of the dicarboxylate and oxoglutarate carriers, but also contains a proton binding site and several hydrophobic residues. As found in other mitochondrial carriers, UCP1 has two conserved salt bridge networks on either side of the central cavity, which regulate access to the substrate binding site in an alternating way. The conserved domain structures and mobile inter-domain interfaces are consistent with an alternating access mechanism too.

Unlike fadD, a member of the Vibrio fad regulon, VC2105 played no role in bacterial growth and expression of the two virulence-associated genes (ctxAB and tcpA). Therefore, since transcriptional regulation of vc2105 fits the criteria for fad genes, it seems likely that vc2105 acts as a new auxiliary member of the Vibrio fad regulon. The respiratory lipoquinone, menaquinone, functions as an inducer of genes regulated by the Mycobacterium smegmatis repressor MSMEG_2295. A previous study reported that the Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msm) protein MSMEG_2295 is a repressor controlling the expression of several genes, including that for MSMEG_5125, a putative isoprenoid binding protein belonging to the YceI family, and DinB2, a DNA damage repair enzyme. This repressor is encoded by the first gene of the operon that also expresses the gene for DinB2. Targeted inhibition of MSMEG_5125 using CRISPRi technology resulted\nYqjH is transcriptionally regulated by the ferric uptake regulator and a newly discovered regulator encoded by yqjI. The apo-form of YqjI is a transcriptional repressor of both the yqjH and yqjI genes. YqjI repressor function is disrupted upon binding of nickel. The YqjI N-terminus is homologous to nickel-binding proteins, implicating this region as a nickel-binding domain. Based on function, yqjI and yqjH should be renamed Ni-responsive Fe-uptake regulator (nfeR) and Ni-responsive Fe-uptake flavoprotein (nfeF), respectively. X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy was employed to characterize the nickel binding site(s) within YqjI. Putative nickel binding ligands were targeted by site-directed mutagenesis and resulting variants were analyzed in vivo for repressor function. Isothermal titration calorimetry and competitive binding assays were used to further quantify nickel interactions with wild-type YqjI and its mutant derivatives. Results indicate plasticity in the nickel binding domain of YqjI.

These results highlight that 'sequence encoded \u03baB DNA-geometry' regulates gene expression by exerting allosteric effect on binding of Rel proteins which in turn regulates interaction with co-regulators. Further, we identified and characterized putative repressor motifs in Dl-target genes, which can potentially aid in functional annotation of Dorsal gene regulatory network. Role of co-activators and co-repressors in the mechanism of steroid/thyroid receptor action. Steroid/thyroid hormone receptors are ligand-dependent transcription factors that regulate diverse aspects of growth, development, and homeostasis by binding as homodimers or heterodimers to their cognate DNA response elements to modulate transcription of target genes. Transactivation by steroid/ thyroid hormone receptors involves a conserved AF-2 domain located in the distal carboxy-terminus of the receptors. The existence\nA strongly reduced repressor activity was observed when two of the zinc-coordinating cysteine residues were exchanged against serine or alanine, demonstrating the role of zinc in Mlc-mediated repressor function. The structures of a putative fructokinase from Bacillus subtilis, the glucokinase from Escherichia coli, and a glucomannokinase from Arthrobacter sp. showed high structural homology to the ROK family part of Mlc. Conserved cysteine residues are necessary for nickel-induced allosteric regulation of the metalloregulatory protein YqjI (NfeR) in E. coli. Transition metal homeostasis is necessary to sustain life. First row transition metals act as cofactors within the cell, performing vital functions ranging from DNA repair to respiration. However, intracellular metal concentrations exceeding physiological requirements may be toxic. In E. coli, the YqjH flavoprotein is thought to play a role in iron homeostasis. YqjH is transcriptionally regulated by the ferric uptake regulator and a newly discovered regulator encoded by yqjI. The apo-form of\nthe VC2105 protein played no role in bacterial growth and virulence-associated gene expression of ctxAB (cholera toxin A/B) and tcpA (toxin coregulated pilus A). Given that the transcriptional regulation of vc2105 fits the criteria for fatty acid degradation (fad) genes, we suggested that it is a new member of the Vibrio fad regulon.IMPORTANCE: The Vibrio FadR regulator is unusual in that it has two ligand-binding sites. Different versions of the FadR regulatory proteins were prepared and characterized in vitro and in vivo. An auxiliary fad gene (vc2105) from Vibrio was proposed that encodes a putative thioesterase and has a predicted FadR-binding site (AAC TGG TA A GAG CAC TT). The function of this putative binding site was proved using both EMSA and SPR. Further in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that the Vibrio FadR is a repressor for the vc2105 gene. Unlike fadD, a member of the Vibrio fad\nRole of sequence encoded \u03baB DNA geometry in gene regulation by Dorsal. Many proteins of the Rel family can act as both transcriptional activators and repressors. However, mechanism that discerns the 'activator/repressor' functions of Rel-proteins such as Dorsal (Drosophila homologue of mammalian NF\u03baB) is not understood. Using genomic, biophysical and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that the underlying principle of this functional specificity lies in the 'sequence-encoded structure' of the \u03baB-DNA. We show that Dorsal-binding motifs exist in distinct activator and repressor conformations. Molecular dynamics of DNA-Dorsal complexes revealed that repressor \u03baB-motifs typically have A-tract and flexible conformation that facilitates interaction with co-repressors. Deformable structure of repressor motifs, is due to changes in the hydrogen bonding in A:T pair in the 'A-tract' core. The sixth nucleotide in the nonameric \u03baB-motif, 'A' (A(6)) in the repressor motifs and 'T' (T(6)) in the activator motifs, is critical to confer this functional specificity as\npromote the expression of downstream negative components that are putative transcription factors/regulators or ubiquitin E2/E3 enzymes. In addition, one of the putative DELLA targets, XERICO, promotes accumulation of abscisic acid (ABA) that antagonizes GA effects. Therefore, DELLA may restrict GA-promoted processes by modulating both GA and ABA pathways.\ndirectly to DELLA proteins and targeting them for rapid degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Therefore, elucidating the signaling events immediately downstream of DELLA is key to our understanding of how GA controls plant development. Two sets of microarray studies followed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis allowed us to identify 14 early GA-responsive genes that are also early DELLA-responsive in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Chromatin immunoprecipitation provided evidence for in vivo association of DELLA with promoters of eight of these putative DELLA target genes. Expression of all 14 genes was downregulated by GA and upregulated by DELLA. Our study reveals that DELLA proteins play two important roles in GA signaling: (1) they help establish GA homeostasis by direct feedback regulation on the expression of GA biosynthetic and GA receptor genes, and (2) they promote the expression of downstream negative components that are putative transcription factors/regulators or ubiquitin E2/E3 enzymes. In addition, one of\nor antagonistic potential of different compounds. These co-activators and co-repressors appear to act as an accelerator and/or a brake that modulates transcriptional regulation of hormone-responsive target gene expression. Thus, the recent discovery of co-activators and co-repressors expands our knowledge of the mechanisms of steroid receptor action. Transcriptional Repression of the VC2105 Protein by Vibrio FadR Suggests that It Is a New Auxiliary Member of the fad Regulon. UNLABELLED: Recently, our group along with others reported that the Vibrio FadR regulatory protein is unusual in that, unlike the prototypical fadR product of Escherichia coli, which has only one ligand-binding site, Vibrio FadR has two ligand-binding sites and represents a new mechanism for fatty acid sensing. The promoter region of the vc2105 gene, encoding a putative thioesterase, was mapped, and a putative FadR-binding site (AA CTG GTA AGA GCA CTT) was proposed. Different versions of the FadR regulatory proteins were prepared and\nsystem (PTS), including ptsG and manXYZ, the specific enzyme II for glucose and mannose PTS transporters. In addition, Mlc controls the transcription of malT, the gene of the global activator of the mal regulon. The inactivation of Mlc as a repressor is mediated by binding to an actively transporting PtsG (EIICB(Glc)). Here we report the crystal structure of Mlc at 2.7 A resolution representing the first described structure of an ROK (repressors, open reading frames, and kinases) family protein. Mlc forms stable dimers thus explaining its binding affinity to palindromic operator sites. The N-terminal helix-turn-helix domain of Mlc is stabilized by the amphipathic C-terminal helix implicated earlier in EIICB(Glc) binding. Furthermore, the structure revealed a metal-binding site within the cysteine-rich ROK consensus motif that coordinates a structurally important zinc ion. A strongly reduced repressor activity was observed when two of the zinc-coordinating cysteine residues were exchanged against serine or alanine,\nby steroid/ thyroid hormone receptors involves a conserved AF-2 domain located in the distal carboxy-terminus of the receptors. The existence of co-factors, termed co-activators or adapters, was first suggested by transcriptional squelching between progesterone receptors and estrogen receptors. Co-repressors were also postulated to contribute to the silencing function of unliganded thyroid hormone receptor (TR). The yeast two-hybrid system and Far-Western blotting have been used to identify several proteins that interact with members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily in a ligand-sensitive manner. Our laboratory cloned the first functional co-activator, termed steroid receptor co-activator-one (SRC-1), that appears to be a general co-activator for all steroid receptors tested and enhances transactivation of steroid hormone-dependent target genes. Subsequently, many more putative co-activators have been reported, including the SRC-1 related proteins, TIF2 and GRIP1, and other putative and unrelated co-activators such as ARA70, Trip1, RIP140, and TIF1. In addition, another co-activator, CREB-binding protein (CBP),\nit is likely to mediate the feedback mechanism. This result also strengthens our hypothesis that the functions of menaquinone and MSMEG_5125 are interrelated. Menaquinone also induced the MSMEG_2295-controlled operon MSMEG_2295-2294 (dinB2) not induced following the inactivation of MSMEG_5125. Therefore, the activation mechanism of MSMEG_2295-regulated genes may not be the same for all, although derepression is likely to be a common feature. In vitro, menaquinone abolished MSMEG_2295's DNA binding activity by interacting with it, confirming its role as an inducer. Therefore, a menaquinone-MSMEG_5125-regulated gene expression circuit controls Msm respiration and possibly oxidative stress-induced DNA damage repair. The crystal structure of Mlc, a global regulator of sugar metabolism in Escherichia coli. Mlc from Escherichia coli is a transcriptional repressor controlling the expression of a number of genes encoding enzymes of the phosphotransferase system (PTS), including ptsG and manXYZ, the specific enzyme II for glucose and mannose PTS transporters. In addition, Mlc controls\nFadR-binding site (AA CTG GTA AGA GCA CTT) was proposed. Different versions of the FadR regulatory proteins were prepared and purified to homogeneity. Both electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) determined the direct interaction of the vc2105 gene with FadR proteins of various origins. Further, EMSAs illustrated that the addition of long-chain acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) species efficiently dissociates the vc2105 promoter from the FadR regulator. The expression level of the Vibrio cholerae vc2105 gene was elevated 2- to 3-fold in a fadR null mutant strain, validating that FadR is a repressor for the vc2105 gene. The \u03b2-galactosidase activity of a vc2105-lacZ transcriptional fusion was increased over 2-fold upon supplementation of growth medium with oleic acid. Unlike the fadD gene, a member of the Vibrio fad regulon, the VC2105 protein played no role in bacterial growth and virulence-associated gene expression of ctxAB (cholera toxin A/B) and tcpA\nand other putative and unrelated co-activators such as ARA70, Trip1, RIP140, and TIF1. In addition, another co-activator, CREB-binding protein (CBP), has been shown to enhance steroid receptor-dependent target gene transcription. CBP and SRC-1 interact and synergistically enhance transcriptional activation by the ER and PR. Therefore, a ternary complex-consisting of CBP, SRC-1, and liganded steroid receptors-may form to increase the rate of hormone-responsive gene transcription. Similarly, co-repressors, such as SMRT and N-CoR, for TR and retinoic acid receptors (RAR) have been identified. The unliganded TR and RAR have been shown to inhibit basal promoter activity; this silencing of target gene transcription by unliganded receptors is mediated by these co-repressors. Collectively, available evidence supports the following model of steroid-responsive gene transcription. Upon binding of agonist the receptor changes its conformation in the ligand-binding domain that enables recruitment of co-activators, which allows the receptor to interact with the basal transcriptional machinery more efficiently\nligand-binding domain that enables recruitment of co-activators, which allows the receptor to interact with the basal transcriptional machinery more efficiently and to activate transcription. In contrast, binding of antagonists induces a different conformational change in the receptor. Although some antagonist-bound receptor can dimerize and bind to its cognate DNA element, it fails to dislodge the associated co-repressors, which results in a nonproductive interaction with the basal transcriptional machinery. Similarly, the TR and RAR associate with co-repressors in the absence of ligand, thereby resulting in a negative interaction with the transcriptional machinery that silences target gene expression. In the case of mixed agonist/antagonists, such as 4-hydroxytamoxifen, activation of gene transcription may depend on the relative ratio of co-activators and co-repressors in the cell or cell-specific factors that determine the relative agonistic or antagonistic potential of different compounds. These co-activators and co-repressors appear to act as an accelerator and/or a brake that\nfirst gene of the operon that also expresses the gene for DinB2. Targeted inhibition of MSMEG_5125 using CRISPRi technology resulted in a significant loss of Msm's respiratory activity and viability. Since this protein has been predicted to be an isoprenoid binding protein, we suspected a role of menaquinones, which are isoprenoid naphthoquinones, in the observed phenomenon. Accordingly, we tested whether MSMEG_5125's deficiency-induced lethality could be reversed by adding menaquinone. The result was positive, implying cooperation between MSMEG_5125 and menaquinone in bringing about respiration. Inhibition of MSMEG_5125 expression led to the induction of MSMEG_0089 and 2296, two hallmark genes of the MSMEG_2295 regulon. This result suggests that when MSMEG_5125 becomes limiting, a feedback-loop derepresses the MSMEG_2295 regulon genes, including its own. Interestingly, menaquinone functioned as an inducer of MSMEG_5125, indicating that it is likely to mediate the feedback mechanism. This result also strengthens our hypothesis that the functions of menaquinone and\nplasticity in the nickel binding domain of YqjI. Residues C42 and C43 were found to be required for in vivo response of YqjI to nickel stress, though these residues are not required for in vitro nickel binding. We propose that YqjI may contain a vicinal disulfide bond between C42 and C43 that is important for nickel-responsive allosteric interactions between YqjI domains. Global analysis of della direct targets in early gibberellin signaling in Arabidopsis. Bioactive gibberellins (GAs) are phytohormones that regulate growth and development throughout the life cycle of plants. DELLA proteins are conserved growth repressors that modulate all aspects of GA responses. These GA-signaling repressors are nuclear localized and likely function as transcriptional regulators. Recent studies demonstrated that GA, upon binding to its receptor, derepresses its signaling pathway by binding directly to DELLA proteins and targeting them for rapid degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

Our results showed that carnosine restored the onset and clinical symptoms as well as renal tubular injury in DN. Furthermore, carnosine decreased kidney inflammation and fibrosis in DN mice. These results were consistent with high glucose (HG)-treated mice tubular epithelial cells (MTECs). Using web-prediction algorithms, cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) and molecular docking, we identified glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) as a carnosine target. Importantly, we found that GNMT, a multiple functional protein that regulates the cellular pool of methyl groups by controlling the ratio of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), was down-regulated significantly in the serum of Type 1 DM patients and renal tissues of DN mice. Moreover, using cultured TECs, we confirmed that the increased GNMT expression by transient transfection mimicked the protective role of carnosine in reducing inflammation and\nSubstrate Recognition Mechanism of the Putative Yeast Carnosine N-methyltransferase. Anserine (\u03b2-alanyl-N(Pi)-methyl-l-histidine) is a natural metabolite present in skeletal muscle and the central nervous system of vertebrates and plays important physiological roles in living organisms. The production of anserine is catalyzed by carnosine N-methyltransferases, which transfer a methyl group to carnosine (\u03b2-alanyl-l-histidine). However, the structural basis of the substrate recognition for the enzymes is unknown. We present the crystal structure of the putative carnosine N-methyltransferase from yeast named YNL092W in complex with SAH, solved by the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) method. The protein contains a typical Rossmann domain and a characteristic N-terminal helical domain. At the cofactor-binding site, SAH forms an extensive interaction network with the enzyme. The individual contribution of each residue to ligand affinity and enzyme activity was assessed by ITC and methyltransferase assays after mutagenesis of the key residues. Additionally, docking studies and activity assays were conducted in\nintroduced \"substrate trapping\" to enrich HDAC1 substrates using an inactive mutant. Herein, we performed a series of proteomics studies to test the robustness of HDAC1 substrate trapping. Based on our recent results documenting that different HDAC1 mutants preferentially bound different substrates, which suggested that multiple mutants could be used for efficient trapping, trapping with three single point mutants simultaneously identified several potential substrates uniquely compared to a single mutant alone. However, a greater number of biologically interesting hits were observed using only a single mutant, which suggests that the C151A HDAC1 mutant is the optimal trap. Importantly, comparing independent trials with a single mutant performed by different experimentalists and HEK293 cell populations, trapping was robust and reproducible. Based on the reproducible trapping data, carnosine N-methyltransferase 1 (CARNMT1) was validated as an HDAC1 substrate. The data document that mutant trapping is an effective method for discovery of unanticipated HDAC substrates. SIGNIFICANCE:\nwe confirmed that the increased GNMT expression by transient transfection mimicked the protective role of carnosine in reducing inflammation and fibrosis. Conversely, the inhibition of GNMT expression abolished the protective effects of carnosine. In conclusion, carnosine might serve as a promising therapeutic agent for DN and GNMT might be a potential therapeutic target for DN. Proteomics-based trapping with single or multiple inactive mutants reproducibly profiles histone deacetylase 1 substrates. Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) plays a key role in diverse cellular processes. With the aberrant expression of HDAC1 linked to many diseases, including cancers, HDAC inhibitors have been used successfully as therapeutics. HDAC1 has been predominantly associated with histone deacetylation and gene expression. Recently, non-histone substrates have revealed diverse roles of HDAC1 beyond epigenetics. To augment discovery of non-histone substrates, we introduced \"substrate trapping\" to enrich HDAC1 substrates using an inactive mutant. Herein, we performed a series of proteomics studies to\nby ITC and methyltransferase assays after mutagenesis of the key residues. Additionally, docking studies and activity assays were conducted in order to identify the binding site for carnosine, and a plausible complex model was proposed. Furthermore, we discovered that two disulfide bridges might be functionally important to the enzyme. By comparison to structure- and sequence-similar methyltransferases, we deduce that the enzyme most likely acts on a protein substrate. Our structural analyses shed light on the catalytic mechanism and substrate recognition by YNL092W. Role of aldose reductase in the metabolism and detoxification of carnosine-acrolein conjugates. Oxidation of unsaturated lipids generates reactive aldehydes that accumulate in tissues during inflammation, ischemia, or aging. These aldehydes form covalent adducts with histidine-containing dipeptides such as carnosine and anserine, which are present in high concentration in skeletal muscle, heart, and brain. The metabolic pathways involved in the detoxification and elimination of these conjugates are, however, poorly\nskeletal muscle, heart, and brain. The metabolic pathways involved in the detoxification and elimination of these conjugates are, however, poorly defined, and their significance in regulating oxidative stress is unclear. Here we report that conjugates of carnosine with aldehydes such as acrolein are produced during normal metabolism and excreted in the urine of mice and adult human non-smokers as carnosine-propanols. Our studies show that the reduction of carnosine-propanals is catalyzed by the enzyme aldose reductase (AR). Carnosine-propanals were converted to carnosine-propanols in the lysates of heart, skeletal muscle, and brain tissue from wild-type (WT) but not AR-null mice. In comparison with WT mice, the urinary excretion of carnosine-propanols was decreased in AR-null mice. Carnosine-propanals formed covalent adducts with nucleophilic amino acids leading to the generation of carnosinylated proteins. Deletion of AR increased the abundance of proteins bound to carnosine in skeletal muscle, brain, and heart of aged mice and promoted\nAR increased the abundance of proteins bound to carnosine in skeletal muscle, brain, and heart of aged mice and promoted the accumulation of carnosinylated proteins in hearts subjected to global ischemia ex vivo. Perfusion with carnosine promoted post-ischemic functional recovery in WT but not in AR-null mouse hearts. Collectively, these findings reveal a previously unknown metabolic pathway for the removal of carnosine-propanal conjugates and suggest a new role of AR as a critical regulator of protein carnosinylation and carnosine-mediated tissue protection. Carnosine alleviates diabetic nephropathy by targeting GNMT, a key enzyme mediating renal inflammation and fibrosis. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common microvascular complication of diabetes and the main cause of end-stage nephropathy (ESRD). Inflammation and fibrosis play key roles in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. By using in vivo and in vitro DN models, our laboratory has identified the protective role of carnosine (CAR) on renal tubules.\nan HDAC1 substrate. The data document that mutant trapping is an effective method for discovery of unanticipated HDAC substrates. SIGNIFICANCE: Histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins are well established epigenetic transcriptional regulators that deacetylate histone substrates to control gene expression. More recently, deacetylation of non-histone substrates has linked HDAC activity to functions outside of epigenetics. Given the use of HDAC inhibitor drugs as anti-cancer therapeutics, understanding the full functions of HDAC proteins in cell biology is essential to future drug design. To discover unanticipated non-histone substrates and further characterize HDAC functions, inactive mutants have been used to \"trap\" putative substrates, which were identified with mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis. Here multiple trapping studies were performed to test the robustness of using inactive mutants and proteomics for HDAC substrate discovery. The data confirm the value of trapping mutants as effective tools to discover HDAC substrates and link HDAC activity to unexpected biological functions.",

Thus, the precise cellular functions of selenos and their interconnectivity have only recently begun to emerge. This review aims to summarize recent insights into the structure, interactome, and cellular roles of selenos. Biology and Roles in Diseases of Selenoprotein I Characterized by Ethanolamine Phosphotransferase Activity and Antioxidant Potential. Selenoprotein I (SELENOI) has been demonstrated to be an ethanolamine phosphotransferase (EPT) characterized by a nonselenoenzymatic domain and to be involved in the main synthetic branch of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, defects of SELENOI may affect the health status through the multiple functions of PE. On the other hand, selenium (Se) is covalently incorporated into SELENOI as selenocysteine (Sec) in its peptide, which forms a Sec-centered domain as in the other members of the selenoprotein family. Unlike other selenoproteins, Sec-containing\nits peptide, which forms a Sec-centered domain as in the other members of the selenoprotein family. Unlike other selenoproteins, Sec-containing SELENOI was formed at a later stage of animal evolution, and the high conservation of the structural domain for PE synthesis across a wide range of species suggests the importance of EPT activity in supporting the survival and evolution of organisms. A variety of factors, such as species characteristics (age and sex), diet and nutrition (dietary Se and fat intakes), SELENOI-specific properties (tissue distribution and rank in the selenoproteome), etc., synergistically regulate the expression of SELENOI in a tentatively unclear interaction. The N- and C-terminal domains confer 2 distinct biochemical functions to SELENOI, namely PE regulation and antioxidant potential, which may allow it to be involved in numerous physiological processes, including neurological diseases (especially hereditary spastic paraplegia), T cell activation, tumorigenesis, and adipocyte differentiation. In this review, we summarize advances\nSelenoprotein S: A versatile disordered protein. Selenoprotein S (selenos) is a small, intrinsically disordered membrane protein that is associated with various cellular functions, such as inflammatory processes, cellular stress response, protein quality control, and signaling pathways. It is primarily known for its contribution to the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which governs the extraction of misfolded proteins or misassembled protein complexes from the ER to the cytosol for degradation by the proteasome. However, selenos's other cellular roles in signaling are equally vital, including the control of transcription factors and cytokine levels. Consequently, genetic polymorphisms of selenos are associated with increased risk for diabetes, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular diseases, while high expression levels correlate with poor prognosis in several cancers. Its inhibitory role in cytokine secretion is also exploited by viruses. Since selenos binds multiple protein complexes, however, its specific contributions to various cellular pathways and diseases have been difficult to establish. Thus,\nincluding neurological diseases (especially hereditary spastic paraplegia), T cell activation, tumorigenesis, and adipocyte differentiation. In this review, we summarize advances in the biology and roles of SELENOI, shedding light on the precise regulation of SELENOI expression and PE homeostasis by dietary Se intake and pharmaceutical or transgenic approaches to modulate the corresponding pathological status.",

        "desc": "The hybrid channels displayed characteristics of heterotetrameric channels with kinetics that more closely resembled a native cardiac transient outward current. The inactivation and recovery from inactivation of the heteromeric channels indicated that the presence of a single inactivating subunit (Kv1.4) was probably sufficient to cause channel inactivation. The results demonstrate that expression of different K+ channel genes can produce channel protein subunits that assemble as heteromultimers with unique properties. It is shown that certain combinations of voltage-gated K+ channels probably do not contribute to native transient outward current. However, one combination of subunits could not be excluded. Therefore, this mechanism of channel assembly may underlie some of the functional diversity of potassium channels found in the cardiovascular system. KCNA4 deficiency leads to a syndrome of abnormal striatum, congenital cataract and intellectual disability. BACKGROUND: Voltage-gated potassium channels are highly diverse proteins representing the most complex class of voltage-gated ion channels from\nfuture studies. Using this approach we identify and confirm six novel LNX1 binding partners: KCNA4, PAK6, PLEKHG5, PKC-alpha1, TYK2 and PBK, and suggest that LNX1 functions as a signalling scaffold. KCNE4 suppresses Kv1.3 currents by modulating trafficking, surface expression and channel gating. Voltage-dependent potassium channels (Kv) play a crucial role in the activation and proliferation of leukocytes. Kv channels are either homo- or hetero-oligomers. This composition modulates their surface expression and serves as a mechanism for regulating channel activity. Kv channel interaction with accessory subunits provides mechanisms for channels to respond to stimuli beyond changes in membrane potential. Here, we demonstrate that KCNE4 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E member 4), but not KCNE2, functions as an inhibitory Kv1.3 partner in leukocytes. Kv1.3 trafficking, targeting and activity are altered by the presence of KCNE4. KCNE4 decreases current density, slows activation, accelerates inactivation, increases cumulative inactivation, retains Kv1.3 in the ER and\ncomplexes that repolarize the human ventricular myocardium. KCNE1 and KCNE2 inhibit forward trafficking of homomeric N-type voltage-gated potassium channels. Potassium currents generated by voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels comprising \u03b1-subunits from the Kv1, 2, and 3 subfamilies facilitate high-frequency firing of mammalian neurons. Within these subfamilies, only three \u03b1-subunits (Kv1.4, Kv3.3, and Kv3.4) generate currents that decay rapidly in the open state because an N-terminal ball domain blocks the channel pore after activation-a process termed N-type inactivation. Despite its importance to shaping cellular excitability, little is known of the processes regulating surface expression of N-type \u03b1-subunits, versus their slowly inactivating (delayed rectifier) counterparts. Here we found that currents generated by homomeric Kv1.4, Kv3.3, and Kv3.4 channels are all strongly suppressed by the single transmembrane domain ancillary (\u03b2) subunits KCNE1 and KCNE2. A combination of electrophysiological, biochemical, and immunofluorescence analyses revealed this suppression is due to KCNE1 and KCNE2 retaining Kv1.4 and\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder. Our study highlights potassium channels' role in ocular and neuronal genetics. Identification of an evolutionarily conserved extracellular threonine residue critical for surface expression and its potential coupling of adjacent voltage-sensing and gating domains in voltage-gated potassium channels. The dynamic expression of voltage-gated potassium channels (Kvs) at the cell surface is a fundamental factor controlling membrane excitability. In exploring possible mechanisms controlling Kv surface expression, we identified a region in the extracellular linker between the first and second of the six (S1-S6) transmembrane-spanning domains of the Kv1.4 channel, which we hypothesized to be critical for its biogenesis. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, patch clamp electrophysiology, and mutagenesis, we identified a single threonine residue at position 330 within the Kv1.4 S1-S2 linker that is absolutely required for cell surface expression. Mutation of Thr-330 to an alanine, aspartate, or lysine prevented surface expression. However, surface expression occurred upon co-expression of\nThe KCNE1/2-enforced checkpoint ensures N-type \u03b1-subunits only reach the cell surface as part of intra-subfamily mixed-\u03b1 complexes, thereby governing channel composition, inactivation rate, and-by extension-cellular excitability. Structural and functional characterization of Kv6.2 a new gamma-subunit of voltage-gated potassium channel. We have cloned and functionally expressed Kv6.2, a new member of the Kv6 subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channel subunits. The human Kv6.2 (KCNF2) gene was mapped at 18q22-18q23. Kv6.2 mRNA is preferentially expressed in rat and human myocard. Rat and human Kv6.2 subunits appear to be unable to form functional Kv channels in a heterologous expression system, but, when coexpressed with Kv2.1 alpha subunits, heteromultimeric Kv channels were formed mediating voltage-activated delayed-rectifier type outward currents. Their kinetics and conductance-voltage relationship were different from those mediated by homomultimeric Kv2.1 channels. Yeast two-hybrid reporter assays indicated that Kv6.2 amino-termini are able to interact specifically with the Kv2.1 amino-terminus. It is proposed that this\nand ADAM23 are transmembrane proteins that bind the secreted synaptic protein LGI1 and associate with Kv1.1/Kv1.4 potassium channels. However, the roles of these proteins in regulated voltage-gated potassium currents are poorly understood. Methods Cultured cells were transfected to express ADAM22, ADAM23, and Kv1.1/Kv1.4. Voltage-gated potassium currents were measured by whole-cell patch-clamp. Immunostaining Kv1.1 with fluorescent antibodies and fluorescently tagged Kv1.1 subunits was used to measure the effects of ADAM proteins on cell-surface and total expression of Kv1.1 channels. LGI1-conditioned media was added to assess the effect on LGI1 on Kv1.1 currents. Results Cells transfected with Kv1.1/Kv1.4 showed voltage-gated potassium currents (Kv1.1 currents). ADAM23 was a powerful negative regulator of Kv1.1 currents and caused decreased surface expression of Kv1.1 subunits. This decrease in current was not mediated by clathrin-dependent endocytosis. LGI1-conditioned media did not affect the negative regulation of Kv1.1 currents by ADAM23. ADAM22 had no significant effect on Kv1.1 currents\nthe voltage-gated potassium channel gene KCNA1 (hKv1.1), which alter the delayed-rectifier function of the channel. Shaker-like channels of different cell types may be formed by unique hetero-oligomeric complexes comprising Kv1.1, Kv1.4 and Kvbeta1.x subunits. Here we show that the human Kvbeta1.1 and Kvbeta1.2 subunits modulated the functional properties of tandemly linked Kv1.4-1.1 wild-type channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes by (i) increasing the rate and amount of N-type inactivation, (ii) slowing the recovery rate from inactivation, (iii) accelerating the cumulative inactivation of the channel and (iv) negatively shifting the voltage dependence of inactivation. To date, the role of the human Kv1.4-1.1, Kv1.4-1.1/Kvbeta1.1 and Kv1.4-1.1/Kvbeta1.2 channels in the aetiopathogenesis of EA1 has not been investigated. Here we also show that the EA1 mutations E325D, V404I and V408A, which line the ion-conducting pore, and I177N, which resides within the S1 segment, alter the fast inactivation and repriming properties of the channels by\naction potential dome, predicting an increased ventricular transmural Ito gradient. The previously described KCNJ8-S422L mutation was not identified in this cohort of patients with ECG evidence of J-wave syndrome.CONCLUSIONS: These findings are the first to implicate the KCND2 gene as a novel cause of J-wave syndrome associated with sudden cardiac arrest. However, genetic defects in I(to)-encoding genes seem to be an uncommon cause of sudden cardiac arrest in patients with apparent J-wave syndromes. Episodic ataxia type 1 mutations in the KCNA1 gene impair the fast inactivation properties of the human potassium channels Kv1.4-1.1/Kvbeta1.1 and Kv1.4-1.1/Kvbeta1.2. Episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) is an autosomal dominant neurological disorder characterized by constant muscle rippling movements (myokymia) and episodic attacks of ataxia. Several heterozygous point mutations have been found in the coding sequence of the voltage-gated potassium channel gene KCNA1 (hKv1.1), which alter the delayed-rectifier function of the channel. Shaker-like channels of different cell\nKv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels in developmental perspective. Kv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels consist of two types of \u03b1-subunits: (a) electrically-active Kcnb1 \u03b1-subunits and (b) silent or modulatory \u03b1-subunits plus \u03b2-subunits that, similar to silent \u03b1-subunits, also regulate electrically-active subunits. Voltage-gated potassium channels were traditionally viewed, mainly by electrophysiologists, as regulators of the electrical activity of the plasma membrane in excitable cells, a role that is performed by transmembrane protein domains of \u03b1-subunits that form the electric pore. Genetic studies revealed a role for this region of \u03b1-subunits of voltage-gated potassium channels in human neurodevelopmental disorders, such as epileptic encephalopathy. The N- and C-terminal domains of \u03b1-subunits interact to form the cytoplasmic subunit of heterotetrameric potassium channels that regulate electric pores. Subsequent animal studies revealed the developmental functions of Kcnb1-containing voltage-gated potassium channels and illustrated their role during brain development and reproduction. These functions of potassium channels are discussed in this review\nanalysis of these disease modules showed novel molecular pathological mechanisms of RE, such as the novel enriched pathways (e.g., \"presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors\", \"signaling by insulin receptor\"). Further analysis on the relationships between current drug targets and the RE-related disease genes showed the rational mechanisms of most antiepileptic drugs. In addition, we detected ten potential novel drug targets (e.g., KCNA1, KCNA4-6, KCNC3, KCND2, KCNMA1, CAMK2G, CACNB4 and GRM1) located in three RE related disease modules, which might provide novel insights into the new drug discovery for RE therapy. KCNE1 and KCNE2 provide a checkpoint governing voltage-gated potassium channel \u03b1-subunit composition. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) currents generated by N-type \u03b1-subunit homotetramers inactivate rapidly because an N-terminal ball domain blocks the channel pore after activation. Hence, the inactivation rate of heterotetrameric channels comprising both N-type and non-N-type (delayed rectifier) \u03b1-subunits depends upon the number of N-type \u03b1-subunits in the complex. As Kv channel\nexpression. We propose that Thr-330 serves to interlock the voltage-sensing and gating domains of adjacent monomers, thereby yielding a structure competent for the surface expression of functional tetramers. Impact of ancillary subunits on ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels generate the outward K(+) ion currents that constitute the primary force in ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium channels comprise tetramers of pore-forming alpha subunits and, in probably most cases in vivo, ancillary or beta subunits that help define the properties of the Kv current generated. Ancillary subunits can be broadly categorized as cytoplasmic or transmembrane and can modify Kv channel trafficking, conductance, gating, ion selectivity, regulation, and pharmacology. Because of their often profound effects on Kv channel function, studies of the molecular correlates of ventricular repolarization must take into account ancillary subunits as well as alpha subunits. Cytoplasmic ancillary subunits include the Kv beta subunits, which regulate a range of Kv channels\nchannel gating and reduced functional expression of Kv1 channels, which may account for some of the phenotypes of the EA1 patient. Heteromultimeric assembly of human potassium channels. Molecular basis of a transient outward current? To gain insight into the molecular basis of cardiac repolarization, we have expressed K+ channels cloned from ventricular myocardium in Xenopus oocytes. A recently identified human cardiac K+ channel isoform (human Kv1.4) has properties similar to the 4-aminopyridine-sensitive calcium-insensitive component of the cardiac transient outward current. However, these channels recovered from inactivation much slower than native channels. Hybrid channels consisting of subunits from different K+ channel clones (delayed rectifier channels [Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.5] and Kv1.4) were created by coinjection of cRNAs in oocytes. Multimeric channels consisting of Kv1.4:Kv1.1, Kv1.4:Kv1.2, and Kv1.4:Kv1.5 were expressed and compared. The hybrid channels displayed characteristics of heterotetrameric channels with kinetics that more closely resembled a native cardiac transient outward current.\nintellectual disability. BACKGROUND: Voltage-gated potassium channels are highly diverse proteins representing the most complex class of voltage-gated ion channels from structural and functional perspectives. Deficiency of these channels usually results in various human disorders.OBJECTIVES: To describe a novel autosomal recessive syndrome associated with KCNA4 deficiency leading to congenital cataract, abnormal striatum, intellectual disability and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.METHODS: We used SNP arrays, linkage analyses, autozygosity mapping, whole-exome sequencing, RT-PCR and two-electrode voltage-clamp recording.RESULTS: We identified a missense variant (p.Arg89Gln) in KCNA4 in four patients from a consanguineous family manifesting a novel syndrome of congenital cataract, abnormal striatum, intellectual disability and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The variant was fully segregated with the disease and absent in 747 ethnically matched exomes. Xenopus oocytes were injected with human Kv1.4 wild-type mRNA, R89Q and WT/R89Q channels. The wild type had mean current amplitude that was significantly greater than those recorded from the cells expressing\nother MiRPs (1-4) in regulating cardiac Kv channels such as KCNQ1 and hERG in vivo are under debate. MiRP1 alters hERG function and pharmacology, and inherited MiRP1 mutations are associated with inherited and acquired arrhythmias, but controversy exists over the native role of MiRP1 in regulating hERG (and therefore ventricular I(Kr)) in vivo. Some ancillary subunits may exhibit varied expression to shape spatial Kv current variation, for example, KChIP2 and the epicardial-endocardial I(to) current density gradient. Indeed, it is likely that most native ventricular Kv channels exhibit temporal and spatial heterogeneity of subunit composition, complicating both modeling of their functional impact on the ventricular action potential and design of specific current-targeted compounds. Here, we discuss current thinking and lines of experimentation aimed at resolving the complexities of the Kv channel complexes that repolarize the human ventricular myocardium. KCNE1 and KCNE2 inhibit forward trafficking of homomeric N-type voltage-gated potassium channels. Potassium\nreporter assays indicated that Kv6.2 amino-termini are able to interact specifically with the Kv2.1 amino-terminus. It is proposed that this protein protein interaction underlies Kv2.1/Kv6.2 subunit assembly and the expression of functional heteromultimeric Kv2.1/Kv6.2 channels. The most resiliant feature of the Kv2.1/Kv6.2 channels was their submicromolar sensitivity to the antiarrhythmic drug propafenone. The data suggest that delayed-rectifier type channels containing Kv6.2 subunits may contribute to cardiac action potential repolarization. The episodic ataxia type 1 mutation I262T alters voltage-dependent gating and disrupts protein biosynthesis of human Kv1.1 potassium channels. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels are essential for setting neuronal membrane excitability. Mutations in human Kv1.1 channels are linked to episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1). The EA1-associated mutation I262T was identified from a patient with atypical phenotypes. Although a previous report has characterized its suppression effect, several key questions regarding the impact of the I262T mutation on Kv1.1 as well as other members\npresence of KCNE4. KCNE4 decreases current density, slows activation, accelerates inactivation, increases cumulative inactivation, retains Kv1.3 in the ER and impairs channel targeting to lipid raft microdomains. KCNE4 associates with Kv1.3 in the ER and decreases the number of Kv1.3 channels at the cell surface, which diminishes cell excitability. Kv1.3 and KCNE4 are differentially regulated upon activation or immunosuppression in macrophages. Thus, lipopolysaccharide-induced activation increases Kv1.3 and KCNE4 mRNA, whereas dexamethasone triggers a decrease in Kv1.3 with no changes in KCNE4. The channelosome composition determines the activity and affects surface expression and membrane localization. Therefore, KCNE4 association might play a crucial role in controlling immunological responses. Our results indicate that KCNE ancillary subunits could be new targets for immunomodulation. ADAM23 is a negative regulator of Kv1.1/Kv1.4 potassium currents. Background ADAM22 and ADAM23 are transmembrane proteins that bind the secreted synaptic protein LGI1 and associate with Kv1.1/Kv1.4 potassium channels. However, the\nboth N-type and non-N-type (delayed rectifier) \u03b1-subunits depends upon the number of N-type \u03b1-subunits in the complex. As Kv channel inactivation and inactivation recovery rates regulate cellular excitability, the composition and expression of these heterotetrameric complexes are expected to be tightly regulated. In a companion article, we showed that the single transmembrane segment ancillary (\u03b2) subunits KCNE1 and KCNE2 suppress currents generated by homomeric Kv1.4, Kv3.3, and Kv3.4 channels, by trapping them early in the secretory pathway. Here, we show that this trapping is prevented by coassembly of the N-type \u03b1-subunits with intra-subfamily delayed rectifier \u03b1-subunits. Extra-subfamily delayed rectifier \u03b1-subunits, regardless of their capacity to interact with KCNE1 and KCNE2, cannot rescue Kv1.4 or Kv3.4 surface expression unless engineered to interact with them using N-terminal A and B domain swapping. The KCNE1/2-enforced checkpoint ensures N-type \u03b1-subunits only reach the cell surface as part of intra-subfamily mixed-\u03b1 complexes, thereby governing channel\nits suppression effect, several key questions regarding the impact of the I262T mutation on Kv1.1 as well as other members of the Kv1 subfamily remain unanswered. Herein we show that the dominant-negative effect of I262T on Kv1.1 current expression is not reversed by co-expression with Kv\u03b21.1 or Kv\u03b22 subunits. Biochemical examinations indicate that I262T displays enhanced protein degradation and impedes membrane trafficking of Kv1.1 wild-type subunits. I262T appears to be the first EA1 mutation directly associated with impaired protein stability. Further functional analyses demonstrate that I262T changes the voltage-dependent activation and Kv\u03b21.1-mediated inactivation, uncouples inactivation from activation gating, and decelerates the kinetics of cumulative inactivation of Kv1.1 channels. I262T also exerts similar dominant effects on the gating of Kv1.2 and Kv1.4 channels. Together our data suggest that I262T confers altered channel gating and reduced functional expression of Kv1 channels, which may account for some of the phenotypes of the EA1\nWT/R89Q channels. The wild type had mean current amplitude that was significantly greater than those recorded from the cells expressing the same amount of mutant mRNA. Co-expression of the wild type and mutant mRNAs resulted in mean current amplitude that was significantly different from that of the wild type. RT-PCR indicated that KCNA4 is present in mouse brain, lens and retina. KCNA4 interacts with several molecules including synaptotagmin I, DLG1 and DLG2. The channel co-localises with cholinergic amacrine and rod bipolar cells in rats and is widely distributed in the central nervous system. Based on previous studies, the channel is highly expressed in outer retina, rod inner segments, hippocampus and concentrated in axonal membranes.CONCLUSION: KCNA4 (Kv1.4) is implicated in a novel syndrome characterised by striatal thinning, congenital cataract and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Our study highlights potassium channels' role in ocular and neuronal genetics. Identification of an evolutionarily conserved extracellular\nas well as alpha subunits. Cytoplasmic ancillary subunits include the Kv beta subunits, which regulate a range of Kv channels and may link channel gating to redox potential, and the KChIPs, which appear most often associated with Kv4 subfamily channels that generate the ventricular I(to) current. Transmembrane ancillary subunits include the MinK-related proteins (MiRPs) encoded by KCNE genes, which modulate members of most Kv alpha subunit subfamilies, and the putative 12-transmembrane domain KCR1 protein, which modulates hERG. In some cases, such as the ventricular I(Ks) channel complex, it is well established that the KCNQ1 alpha subunit must coassemble with the MinK (KCNE1) single-transmembrane domain ancillary subunit for recapitulation of the characteristic, unusually slowly-activating I(Ks) current. In other cases, it is not so clear-cut, and in particular, the roles of the other MiRPs (1-4) in regulating cardiac Kv channels such as KCNQ1 and hERG in vivo are under debate. MiRP1 alters",

Western analysis and immunohistochemistry were performed using antibodies raised against two peptide sequences conserved among odorant receptors and using fusion protein antibodies to G-protein receptor kinase 3 (GRK3/beta ARK2) and beta-arrestin2.RESULTS: We detected transcripts encoding putative odorant receptors in both testis and round spermatids of the adult rat. Restriction digests of the PCR products demonstrated the existence of multiple gene products. Two anti-odorant receptor antibodies specifically recognized a 64 kD band in rat sperm preparations by Western blot. The proteins GRK3 and beta-arrestin2, implicated in olfactory desensitization, were detected in sperm cytosolic extracts using Western analysis. Immunohistochemistry colocalized putative odorant receptors, GRK3 and beta-arrestin2 to elongating spermatids\nwere detected in sperm cytosolic extracts using Western analysis. Immunohistochemistry colocalized putative odorant receptors, GRK3 and beta-arrestin2 to elongating spermatids in the testis and to the midpiece of mature sperm.CONCLUSIONS: The specific localization of odorant receptors to the respiratory center of mature sperm is consistent with a role for these proteins in transducing chemotactic signals. Based on the colocalization, it is plausible that GRK3 and beta-arrestin2 function in sperm to regulate putative chemoreceptor responses. Length analyses of Drosophila odorant receptors. Odorant receptors comprise a unique family of G-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptors both in mammals and insects. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, all 61 candidate odorant receptor genes have been identified based on the complete genome sequence, and their expression patterns have been examined. A given odorant receptor is expressed in the antenna or maxillary palp, or not expressed at all. Here we have applied a set of statistical analyses to\nand 143 within TMS3 altered odorant sensitivity. Our results identify the involvement of the extracellular half of TMS3 in Drosophila OR85b in odorant activation of the receptor. This finding can serve as a starting point for future detailed analysis of the molecular basis for odorant recognition by insect ORs, a novel class of ligand-gated channel. Probing olfactory receptors with sequence-specific antibodies. Molecular cloning has revealed the structure of several putative odorant receptors. Chemically synthesized peptides, that correspond to a predicted extracellular domain of the encoded proteins, were employed to generate receptor-specific antibodies. Immunohistological approaches as well as Western-blot analysis confirmed the specificity of the antipeptide sera. Furthermore, deglycosylation experiments explained the observed discrepancy between the molecular mass of odorant receptors, as determined by SDS/PAGE and Western-blot analysis of ciliary proteins (M(r) 50,000), and the predicted protein size based on the deduced primary structure from cloned receptor genes (M(r) 30,000-35,000). Receptor\nsmaller population size. PCA together with histograms also revealed that receptors with an abnormal length configuration tended not to be expressed, suggesting that LT length deviations are related to transcriptional silencing of odorant receptor genes. Rank transformation tests pointed out possible LTs that could have different length between differently expressed receptors at the population level. Taken together, length analyses provide us with a general picture, i.e. \"length configuration,\" of Drosophila odorant receptors at the population level that could point out putatively important functional sites for experimental studies. Transmembrane segment 3 of Drosophila melanogaster odorant receptor subunit 85b contributes to ligand-receptor interactions. The OR class insect odorant receptors are ligand-gated ion channels comprised of at least one common subunit (OR83b in Drosophila) and at least one putative odorant-binding subunit. However, little else is known about the molecular details of insect OR architecture. For example, nothing is known about how these receptors\nachieved by the neuropeptide NLP-9 produced in AWB, which acts with its putative receptor NPR-18, and by the neuropeptide NLP-1 produced in AWC. In addition, another set of sensory neurons inhibits food-odor preference. These mechanistic logics, together with a previously mapped neural circuit underlying food-odor preference, provide a functional network linking sensory response, transduction, and downstream receptors to process complex olfactory information and generate the appropriate behavioral decision essential for survival. Odorant receptors and desensitization proteins colocalize in mammalian sperm. BACKGROUND: The identification of transcripts encoding putative olfactory receptors in mammalian germ cells (1) has generated the hypothesis that olfactory receptors may serve a chemosensory role in sperm chemotaxis during fertilization. We have sought to identify and localize these receptors and their regulatory machinery in rat sperm in order to gain further insight into mammalian sperm chemotaxis and odorant receptor physiology.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)\nand compounds of different chemical classes revealed that distinct receptor subtypes respond to certain odorants but not to others. Graded responses to only a subset of odorants indicate that the heterologous expressed receptor types have a selective but relatively broad ligand specificity. The easily manipulated bacterial system was employed to produce olfactory receptor proteins in large quantities. It was solubilized from inclusion bodies and upon reconstitution in liposomes displayed specific interaction with odor ligands. Expression patterns of two putative odorant-binding proteins in the olfactory organs of Drosophila melanogaster have different implications for their functions. The aqueous medium bathing the dendrites of olfactory neurons contains high concentrations of odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) whose role is still unclear. OBPs may facilitate interactions between odorants and their membrane-bound receptors, perhaps by increasing the water solubility of hydrophobic molecules. Alternatively, OBPs may be involved in the inactivation of odorants and other volatile molecules, preventing desensitization\nat the cytoplasmic membrane of the HEK293 cell and assays enabling large-scale deorphanization, and to characterize the interaction between chemical odorants and ORs is described. The family of human ORs includes ca. 400 putatively functional ORs which are GPCRs (G protein-coupled receptors); to date over 100 human ORs have been deorphanized. Calmodulin modulates insect odorant receptor function. Insect odorant receptors (ORs) are heteromeric complexes of an odor-specific receptor protein (OrX) and a ubiquitous co-receptor protein (Orco). The ORs operate as non-selective cation channels, also conducting Ca(2+) ions. The Orco protein contains a conserved putative calmodulin (CaM)-binding motif indicating a role of CaM in its function. Using Ca(2+) imaging to monitor OR activity we investigated the effect of CaM inhibition on the function of OR proteins. Ca(2+) responses elicited in Drosophila olfactory sensory neurons by stimulation with the synthetic OR agonist VUAA1 were reduced and prolonged by CaM inhibition with the\na multigene family. Although circumstantial evidence suggests that the identified genes encode odorant receptors, unequivocal proof requires demonstration that the resulting proteins should be able to interact with odorous molecules and couple via G proteins onto second messenger cascades. This goal can be achieved by heterologous expression of receptor proteins in surrogate eucaryotic cells, although the task is complicated by the diversity of putative odorous ligands and the large size of the receptor family. Employing the baculovirus/Sf9 cell system it was found that receptor proteins can be expressed at high levels. Stimulating receptor-expressing Sf9 cells with a mixture of numerous odorous compounds elicited a significant and dose-dependent second messenger response, which was never observed in control cells. Assaying a large panel of odorous compounds, including representatives of different odor classes and compounds of different chemical classes revealed that distinct receptor subtypes respond to certain odorants but not to others. Graded\nof odorants remains poorly understood on the structural level of the receptor. Using site-directed mutagenesis we transferred ligand specificity between two functionally related ORs and thereby revealed amino acid residues of central importance for odorant recognition and discrimination of the two receptors. By exchanging two of three residues, differing at equivalent positions of the putative odorant binding site between the mouse OR paralogs Olfr73 (mOR-EG) and Olfr74 (mOR-EV), we selectively changed ligand preference but remarkably also signaling activation strength in both ORs. Computer modeling proposed structural details at atomic resolution how the very same odorant molecule might interact with different contact residues to induce different functional responses in two related receptors. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation of how the olfactory system distinguishes different molecular aspects of a given odorant molecule, and unravel important molecular details of the combinatorial encoding of odorant identity at the OR level. Functional analysis of\n(M(r) 50,000), and the predicted protein size based on the deduced primary structure from cloned receptor genes (M(r) 30,000-35,000). Receptor proteins become phosphorylated upon odorant stimulation of olfactory cilia preparations; this was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation experiments employing the sequence-directed, receptor-specific antibodies. Functional assays revealed that the receptor-specific antibodies significantly attenuate second messenger signalling elicited by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-inducing odorants, whereas activation of the cAMP cascade by appropriate odorants was not affected. These observation indicate that the sequence-specific antibodies not only recognize odorant receptors, but also discriminate between receptor subtypes coupling to different second-messenger pathways. Expression and functional analysis of olfactory receptors. The olfactory system recognizes and discriminates myriads of odorants of diverse molecular structure. This task is supposed to be accomplished by a large array of seven-transmembrane domain receptors encoded by a multigene family. Although circumstantial evidence suggests that the identified genes encode odorant receptors, unequivocal proof requires demonstration that the\nelse is known about the molecular details of insect OR architecture. For example, nothing is known about how these receptors bind odorants, greatly limiting efforts to develop insect OR-targeted compounds for the control of insects involved in disease propagation and agricultural damage. Here we identify a portion of a Drosophila OR that is involved in odorant activation of the receptor. Using the substituted cysteine accessibility method, we identified residues 146-150 of OR85b, located at the predicted interface between transmembrane segment 3 (TMS3) and extracellular loop 2 (ECL2), as playing a role in odorant (2-heptanone) activation. We found that occupation of the receptor by the competitive antagonist 2-nonanone protected the receptor from methanethiosulfonate action at position 148, placing this region close to the odorant-binding site. In addition, mutations at positions 142 and 143 within TMS3 altered odorant sensitivity. Our results identify the involvement of the extracellular half of TMS3 in Drosophila\nhydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs)-potent dietary antioxidants abundant in fruit-via olfactory cues. Flies are unable to smell HCAs directly but are equipped with dedicated olfactory sensory neurons detecting yeast-produced ethylphenols that are exclusively derived from HCAs. These neurons are housed on the maxillary palps, express the odorant receptor Or71a, and are necessary and sufficient for proxy detection of HCAs. Activation of these neurons in adult flies induces positive chemotaxis, oviposition, and increased feeding. We further demonstrate that fly larvae also seek out yeast enriched with HCAs and that larvae use the same ethylphenol cues as the adults but rely for detection upon a larval unique odorant receptor (Or94b), which is co-expressed with a receptor (Or94a) detecting a general yeast volatile. We also show that the ethylphenols act as reliable cues for the presence of dietary antioxidants, as these volatiles are produced--upon supplementation of HCAs--by a wide range of yeasts known to be\nand functional data, we conclude that the product of the Orco gene in this mosquito is crucial for transmitting olfactory signaling and conventional ORs contribute directly to odorant recognition. Our results provide insight into the linkage between odorant receptors and host-seeking in this important vector species. Ric-8B promotes functional expression of odorant receptors. Odorants are detected by a large family of odorant receptors (ORs) expressed in the nose. The information provided by the ORs is transmitted to specific regions of the brain, leading to odorant perception. The determination of the odorant specificities of the different ORs will contribute to the understanding of how odorants are discriminated by the olfactory system. However, to date only a few ORs have been linked to odorants they recognize, because ORs are poorly expressed on the cell surface of heterologous cells. Here we show that Ric-8B, a putative guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Galphaolf, promotes\nsensory receptors, although direct in vivo experimental evidences are lacking. Here we verified the role of an extracellular carboxylesterase, esterase-6 (Est-6), in the sensory physiological and behavioral dynamics of Drosophila melanogaster response to its pheromone, cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA). Est-6 was previously linked to post-mating effects in the reproductive system of females. As Est-6 is also known to hydrolyze cVA in vitro and is expressed in the main olfactory organ, the antenna, we tested here its role in olfaction as a putative odorant-degrading enzyme.RESULTS: We first confirm that Est-6 is highly expressed in olfactory sensilla, including cVA-sensitive sensilla, and we show that expression is likely associated with non-neuronal cells. Our electrophysiological approaches show that the dynamics of olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) responses is strongly influenced by Est-6, as in Est-6\u00b0 null mutants (lacking the Est-6 gene) cVA-sensitive ORN showed increased firing rate and prolonged activity in response to cVA. Est-6\u00b0 mutant\nmolecule, and unravel important molecular details of the combinatorial encoding of odorant identity at the OR level. Functional analysis of Orco and odorant receptors in odor recognition in Aedes albopictus. BACKGROUND: Aedes albopictus is a globally invasive mosquito and a major vector of arboviruses, including dengue, Zika and Chikungunya. Olfactory-related behaviors, particularly host-seeking, offer opportunities to disrupt the disease-transmission process. A better understanding of odorant receptors (ORs) may assist in explaining host selection and location, and contribute to novel strategy of vector control.METHODS: Based on previous prediction of 158 putative odorant receptors by Ae. albopictus genome analysis, 29 AalORs were selected for tissue-specific expression profiles in the present study. AalOrco (AalOR7), AalOR10 and AalOR88, highly expressed in female olfactory tissues, were chosen for further structure predictions as well as functional validation including calcium imaging assay in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and RNA interference assay in Ae. albopictus. We also\nand mediate olfactory responses to a wide range of odorants. In contrast, PBPRP2 is present in the space immediately below the antennal cuticle and in the outer cavity of approximately 30% of the double-walled coeloconic sensilla on the antennal surface. In neither case is PBPRP2 in contact with the dendritic membranes of olfactory neurons, making a carrier function unlikely for this protein. Instead, PBPRP2 may act as a sink, binding to odorants and other volatile chemicals and limiting their interactions with olfactory neurons. Exchanging ligand-binding specificity between a pair of mouse olfactory receptor paralogs reveals odorant recognition principles. A multi-gene family of ~1000 G protein-coupled olfactory receptors (ORs) constitutes the molecular basis of mammalian olfaction. Due to the lack of structural data its remarkable capacity to detect and discriminate thousands of odorants remains poorly understood on the structural level of the receptor. Using site-directed mutagenesis we transferred ligand specificity between\nis critical for survival. Many animals, including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, use sensorimotor systems to detect and locate preferred food sources. However, the signaling mechanisms underlying food-choice behaviors are poorly understood. Here, we characterize the molecular signaling that regulates recognition and preference between different food odors in C. elegans. We show that the major olfactory sensory neurons, AWB and AWC, play essential roles in this behavior. A canonical G\u03b1-protein, together with guanylate cyclases and cGMP-gated channels, is needed for the recognition of food odors. The food-odor-evoked signal is transmitted via glutamatergic neurotransmission from AWC and through AMPA and kainate-like glutamate receptor subunits. In contrast, peptidergic signaling is required to generate preference between different food odors while being dispensable for the recognition of the odors. We show that this regulation is achieved by the neuropeptide NLP-9 produced in AWB, which acts with its putative receptor NPR-18, and by the neuropeptide NLP-1\nolfactory sensory neurons by stimulation with the synthetic OR agonist VUAA1 were reduced and prolonged by CaM inhibition with the potent antagonist W7 but not with the weak antagonist W5. A similar effect was observed for Orco proteins heterologously expressed in CHO cells when CaM was inhibited with W7, trifluoperazine or chlorpromazine, or upon overexpression of CaM-EF-hand mutants. With the Orco CaM mutant bearing a point mutation in the putative CaM site (K339N) the Ca(2+) responses were akin to those obtained for wild type Orco in the presence of W7. There was no uniform effect of W7 on Ca(2+) responses in CHO cells expressing complete ORs (Or22a/Orco, Or47a/Orco, Or33a/Orco, Or56a/Orco). For Or33a and Or47a we observed no significant effect of W7, while it caused a reduced response in cells expressing Or22a and a shortened response for Or56a. An antennal carboxylesterase from Drosophila melanogaster, esterase 6, is a candidate odorant-degrading enzyme\nOr22a and a shortened response for Or56a. An antennal carboxylesterase from Drosophila melanogaster, esterase 6, is a candidate odorant-degrading enzyme toward food odorants. Reception of odorant molecules within insect olfactory organs involves several sequential steps, including their transport through the sensillar lymph, interaction with the respective sensory receptors, and subsequent inactivation. Odorant-degrading enzymes (ODEs) putatively play a role in signal dynamics by rapid degradation of odorants in the vicinity of the receptors, but this hypothesis is mainly supported by in vitro results. We have recently shown that an extracellular carboxylesterase, esterase-6 (EST-6), is involved in the physiological and behavioral dynamics of the response of Drosophila melanogaster to its volatile pheromone ester, cis-vaccenyl acetate. However, as the expression pattern of the Est-6 gene in the antennae is not restricted to the pheromone responding sensilla, we tested here if EST-6 could play a broader function in the antennae. We found that recombinant\nthe antenna or maxillary palp, or not expressed at all. Here we have applied a set of statistical analyses to the length of the extra- and intracellular loops and terminals (LTs) of Drosophila odorant receptors to examine possible inter- and intramolecular relations at the population level. We have first provided some useful statistical information such as mean length values and length histograms to depict a general nature of Drosophila odorant receptors at the population level, after focusing on discrepancy on assigning transmembrane domains between researchers. In a preferable transmembrane assignment, all extracellular LTs, especially the second extracellular loops, were relatively large in length, suggesting their functional significance. Somewhat surprisingly, principle component analysis (PCA) indicated that the maxillary palp receptors were almost as diverse as the antenna receptors despite their much smaller population size. PCA together with histograms also revealed that receptors with an abnormal length configuration tended not to be",

Production of yeast (m2G10) methyltransferase (Trm11 and Trm112 complex) in a wheat germ cell-free translation system. Transfer RNA (guanine-N(2)-)-methyltransferase [tRNA (m(2)G10) methyltransferase] catalyzes a methyl-transfer from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to N(2)-atom of guanine at position 10 (G10) in tRNA and generates N(2)-methylguanine at position 10 (m(2)G10). Yeast enzyme contains two protein subunits (Trm11 and Trm112). Trm11 protein is expected to be a catalytic subunit and Trm112 contains a Zinc-finger. In yeast cells, Trm112 binds not only\npurine N1-methyltransferase and ribonuclease P complexes Mitochondrial tRNAs are transcribed as long polycistronic transcripts of precursor tRNAs and undergo posttranscriptional modifications such as endonucleolytic processing and methylation required for their correct structure and function. Among them, 5\u2032-end processing and purine 9 N1-methylation of mitochondrial tRNA are catalyzed by two proteinaceous complexes with overlapping subunit composition. The Mg2+-dependent RNase P complex for 5\u2032-end cleavage comprises the methyltransferase domain\u2013containing protein tRNA methyltransferase 10C, mitochondrial RNase P subunit (TRMT10C/MRPP1), short-chain oxidoreductase hydroxysteroid 17\u03b2-dehydrogenase 10 (HSD17B10/MRPP2), and metallonuclease KIAA0391/MRPP3. An MRPP1\u2013MRPP2 subcomplex also catalyzes the formation of 1-methyladenosine/1-methylguanosine at position 9 using S-adenosyl-l-methionine as methyl donor. However, a lack of structural information has precluded insights into how these complexes methylate and process mitochondrial tRNA. Here, we used a combination of X-ray crystallography, interaction and activity assays, and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to gain structural insight into the two tRNA modification complexes and their\npresence of MRPP1N alone (Fig. 4C), indicating that this domain is involved in tRNA binding. tRNA binding and activity of MRPP1\u0394MTS and MRPP2.

Methyltransferases from the m(1)A(58) tRNA methyltransferase (TrmI) family catalyze the S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent N(1)-methylation of tRNA adenosine 58. The crystal structure of Thermus thermophilus TrmI, in complex with S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, was determined at 1.7 A resolution. This structure is closely related to that of Mycobacterium tuberculosis TrmI, and their comparison enabled us to enlighten two grooves in the TrmI structure that are large enough and electrostatically compatible to accommodate one tRNA per face of TrmI tetramer. We have then conducted a biophysical study based on electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, site-directed mutagenesis, and molecular docking. First, we confirmed the tetrameric oligomerization state of TrmI, and we showed that this protein remains tetrameric upon tRNA binding, with formation of complexes involving one to two molecules of tRNA per TrmI tetramer.

TRMT10A installs N1-methylguanosine (m1G) in tRNA, and FTO performs demethylation on N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) in mRNA. We show that TRMT10A ablation not only leads to decreased m1G in tRNA but also significantly increases m6A levels in mRNA. Cross-linking and immunoprecipitation, followed by high-throughput sequencing results show that TRMT10A shares a significant overlap of associated mRNAs with FTO, and these mRNAs have accelerated decay rates potentially through the regulation\nunits; RS-Rg, real-space radius of gyration; Porod V, Porod volume; Dmax, maximal intraparticle dimension. a.u., absorbance unit.

A small increase in the dissociation constant (KD) of MRPP1 toward the mature (mt)tRNA with the addition of MRPP2 was observed previously using an EMSA. Therefore, MRPP2 may account for the KD change by 1) assisting in direct interaction with (mt)tRNA, 2) stabilizing a catalytically important structural element in MRPP1 (e.g. the N domain shown to be involved in pre-(mt)tRNA binding), or 3) \u201cremolding\u201d the catalytic components of the MRPP1 MT domain. Future studies are required to further explore these possible mechanisms. The MRPP1\u2013MRPP2\u2013MRPP3 complex is formed only in the presence of the pre-(mt)tRNA substrate. This reconstituted ternary complex, but not MRPP3 alone, exhibited RNase P activity toward the tested pre-(mt)tRNAIle substrate. No RNase P activity was observed for the ternary complex in the absence of either the PPR-domain or the core/NYN domains of MRPP3, but partial removal of the N extension (43 residues) still left\nab initio model generated from the scattering data with no enforced symmetry reveals a lobe adjacent to the putative MRPP2 and tRNA regions, which can accommodate one MRPP3\u0394MTS molecule (Fig. 6G). Thus, our model proposes a stoichiometry of 2 MRPP1\u0394MTS, 4 MRPP2, 1 MRPP3\u0394MTS, and 1 pre-(mt)tRNAIle molecule. This model would suggest a direct interaction between MRPP2 and MRPP3\u0394MTS, possibly without MRPP1\u0394MTS involvement. Nevertheless, size-exclusion chromatography of a mixture containing MRPP2 and MRPP3\u0394MTS (in the absence of pre-(mt)tRNAIle substrate) did not reveal the presence of a stable subcomplex (Fig. S4E). Discussion In this study, we characterized biochemically and structurally the MRPP1 protein and its interaction with MRPP2, MRPP3, and tRNA. This work reveals the first structural models for the unique binary and ternary complexes that are responsible for mitochondrial tRNA processing. The eukaryote-only MRPP1 appears to exist as both monomer and dimer in solution, with dimerization taking place via the\nstudies are warranted to determine whether the 2-fold reduced Km (allopregnanolone) of the complex, compared with MRPP2 alone, would indicate enhancement of MRPP2 activity by MRPP1. In summary, MRPP2 is required for methyltransferase activity of MRPP1, but MRPP2 within the MRPP1\u2013MRPP2 complex is still fully functional as an SDR. MRPP1\u2013MRPP2 complex interacts with MRPP3 in the presence of tRNA The MRPP1\u2013MRPP2 complex interacts with the Mg2+-dependent endoribonuclease MRPP3, resulting in the ternary RNase P complex that performs 5\u2032-end pre-(mt)tRNA processing. The mature MRPP3 protein (MRPP3\u0394MTS) contains an N extension (aa 51\u2013206), a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) domain (aa 207\u2013328), the first half of a core domain (aa 329\u2013360), a catalytic NYN domain (aa 360\u2013541), and the second half of the core domain (aa 342\u2013583) (Fig. 5A). MRPP3 is expected to be the catalytic subunit of this RNase P complex, although it is unclear how MRPP3 interacts with the binary complex of\n(4JWJ, 23.6, 1.9 \u212b, 23%), and Trm10 from S. acidocaldarius (5A7T, 14.0, 2.5 \u212b, 16%).

        "desc": "cap-dependent and the viral IRES-mediated translation through interacting with eukaryotic elongation factor 1A Summary The genomic RNA of hepatitis C virus (HCV) encodes the viral polyprotein precursor that undergoes proteolytic cleavage into structural and nonstructural proteins by cellular and the viral NS3 and NS2-3 proteases. Nonstructural protein 4A (NS4A) is a cofactor of the NS3 serine protease and has been demonstrated to inhibit protein synthesis. In this study, GST pull-down assay was performed to examine potential cellular factors that interact with the NS4A protein and are involved in the pathogenesis of HCV. A trypsin digestion followed by LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that one of the GST-NS4A-interacting proteins to be eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A). Both the N-terminal domain of NS4A from amino acid residues 1\u201320, and the central domain from residues 21\u201334 interacted with eEF1A, but the central domain was the key player involved in the NS4A-mediated translation inhibition.

Very recent findings from our group have established up-regulation of the serine-threonine kinase Akt in pituitary tumours compared to normal pituitary, which may cause phosphorylation of p27 on Thr157 and cytoplasmic retention of p27. PTTG protein is highly expressed in various human tumours, including pituitary tumours. While its mRNA levels are low in normal pituitary, increases in PTTG transcripts from more than 50% to more than 10-fold were recorded in the majority of a series of pituitary adenomas. Control of the cell cycle is a vital part of the cell's replication machinery. Disruption of this process is commonly seen in pituitary tumours and we are now beginning to identify regulatory elements which are likely to play a major role in pituitary oncogenesis. Hepatitis E virus ORF1 encoded non structural protein-host protein interaction network. Hepatitis E\nplay a major role in pituitary oncogenesis. Hepatitis E virus ORF1 encoded non structural protein-host protein interaction network. Hepatitis E virus ORF1 encoded non-structural polyprotein (nsP) consist of multiple domains, namely: Methyltransferase, Y-domain, Protease, X-domain, Helicase and RNA dependent RNA polymerase. We have attempted to identify human liver cell proteins that are interacting with HEV ORF1 encoded functional domains by using Y2H screening. A total of 155 protein-protein interactions between HEV-ORF1 and human proteins were identified. Comparative analysis of the HEV-ORF1-Human interaction network with reconstructed human interactome showed that the cellular proteins interacting with HEV-ORF1 are central and interconnected. Enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology and cellular pathways showed that the viral proteins preferentially interacted with the proteins of metabolism and energy generation along with host immune response and ubiquitin proteasomal pathways. The mTOR and focal adhesion pathways were also targeted by the virus. These interactions suggest that HEV probably utilizes\nmechanism of VPg uridylylation, we show that the active complex contains polymerase, oriI, and 3C(D) at stoichiometry of 1:1:2. Dimerization of 3C(D) is supported by physical and structural data. Polymerase recruitment to and retention in this complex require a protein-protein interaction between the polymerase and 3C(D). Physical and functional data for this interaction are provided for three picornaviruses. VPg association with this complex is weak, suggesting that formation of a complex containing all necessary components of the reaction is rate-limiting for the reaction. We suggest that assembly of this complex in vivo would be facilitated by use of precursor proteins instead of processed proteins. These data provide a glimpse into the organization of the ribonucleoprotein complex that catalyzes this key step in picornavirus genome replication. Hepatitis C virus NS4A inhibits cap-dependent and the viral IRES-mediated translation through interacting with eukaryotic elongation factor 1A Summary The genomic RNA of hepatitis C\nof the VPg uridylylation ribonucleoprotein (initiation) complex. All picornaviruses have a protein, VPg, covalently linked to the 5'-ends of their genomes. Uridylylated VPg (VPg-pUpU) is thought to serve as the protein primer for RNA synthesis. VPg-pUpU can be produced in vitro by the viral polymerase, 3Dpol, in a reaction in which a single adenylate residue of a stem-loop structure, termed oriI, templates processive incorporation of UMP into VPg by using a \"slide-back\" mechanism. This reaction is greatly stimulated by viral precursor protein 3CD or its processed derivative, 3C; both contain RNA-binding and protease activities. We show that the 3C domain encodes specificity for oriI, and the 3D domain enhances the overall affinity for oriI. Thus, 3C(D) stimulation exhibits an RNA length dependence. By using a minimal system to evaluate the mechanism of VPg uridylylation, we show that the active complex contains polymerase, oriI, and 3C(D) at stoichiometry of 1:1:2.

The two 3B1 contact surfaces involve a combination of hydrophobic and basic residues at the N- (G5-P6, R9; Region I) and C-terminus (R16, L19-P20; Region II) of this small protein. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) show that the two 3B1 binding sites play a role in 3Dpol binding, with region II presenting the highest affinity. ELISA assays show that 3Dpol has higher binding affinity for 3B1 than for 3B2 or 3B3. Membrane-based pull-down assays show that 3B1 region II, and to a lesser extent also region I play essential roles in mediating the interaction of 3AB with the polymerase and its recruitment to intracellular membranes. Picornavirus genome replication: assembly and organization of the VPg uridylylation ribonucleoprotein (initiation) complex. All picornaviruses have a protein, VPg, covalently linked to the 5'-ends of their\nmassively increased phosphorylation of p27 on Thr187, but are not associated with changes in Jab1. Macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF), which binds and inactivates Jab1, was noted to be over-expressed in tumours with abundant Jab1, suggesting that it may be part of a compensatory mechanism to moderate Jab1 activity. Proteasomal degradation of p27 requires its ubiquitylation by the SCF ubiquitin ligase, with specific addressing by the F-box protein Skp2 and its co-factor Cks1. Pituitary tumours with high p27 protein expression showed significantly less Skp2 expression than samples with low p27 immunostaining, suggesting that increased Skp2 could play at least a part in this process. No difference was observed in Cks1 mRNA levels between normal pituitaries and pituitary adenomas. The present data suggest that inhibition of growth and tumour development is sensitive not only to the absolute levels of p27 protein, but also to its cellular compartmentalization. Very recent findings from our\nE4-ORF1 proteins encoded by other adenovirus serotypes and subgroups (MK and KK, manuscript in preparation). Proposed molecular mechanism for PI3K activation by the adenovirus E4-ORF1 protein. See text of Discussion for details. Numerous viruses encode proteins that dysregulate PI3K in cells, though molecular mechanisms are lacking in many cases. When mechanistic details are available, they often involve direct or indirect viral protein:PI3K interactions mediated by phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the viral protein itself or on an activated cellular receptor bound to the viral protein. Examples include mouse polyomavirus middle T antigen and EBV LMP1 and LMP2A that directly bind PI3K by mimicking tyrosine phosphorylated, activated membrane receptors; HBV X, HIV-1 Nef, and HCV NS5 that directly couple PI3K to non-receptor tyrosine kinases; and HPV E5 that indirectly binds to PI3K through an interaction with activated, cellular receptor protein tyrosine kinases.

The results raise potential safety concerns about the use of vectors encoding the E4-ORF1 gene in human gene therapy and vaccination. Our findings further suggest that the conserved mechanism revealed here may be targeted for development of therapeutic drugs to treat and prevent adenovirus-associated human diseases. Dual role of the foot-and-mouth disease virus 3B1 protein in the replication complex: As protein primer and as an essential component to recruit 3Dpol to membranes. Picornavirus genome replication takes place in specialized intracellular membrane compartments that concentrate viral RNA and proteins as well as a number of host factors that also participate in the process. The core enzyme in the replication machinery is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) 3Dpol. Replication requires the primer protein 3B (or VPg) attached to two uridine molecules. 3B uridylylation is\nto be a phosphoprotein by immunoprecipitation assay. In immunofluorescence assays, the VZV ORF1 protein was detected at both the plasma membrane and trans-Golgi network in both VZV-infected and ORF1-transfected cells. Moreover, ORF1 proteins associated with each other to form homodimer, and were incorporated into viral particles. The C-terminal hydrophobic domain was required for the association of ORF1 with the membrane structures, indicating that ORF1 protein is anchored to the membrane thorough its C-terminus, which is a transmembrane domain. Because ORF1 possesses a C-terminal transmembrane domain without an N-terminal signal sequence for its translocation to the ER lumen, ORF1 can be classified as a tail-anchored membrane protein. These results show that the N terminus of ORF1 protein faces the cytoplasm in infected cells and the tegument region in mature virions.\ninfertility, and hyperplasia of the pituitary intermediate lobe with nearly 100% mortality caused by such a benign pituitary tumour. Although the p27 gene was not found to be mutated in human pituitary tumours and its mRNA expression was similar in tumour samples in comparison with normal pituitaries, the load of p27 protein expression in corticotroph adenomas and pituitary carcinomas was shown to be much lower than those in normal pituitary tissue or other types of pituitary adenoma, suggesting that post-translational processing of p27 accelerates its removal from the nucleus. In respect to p27 degradation and its cellular compartmentalization, several pathways have been explored. Malignant tumours are associated with increased nuclear immunostaining for Jun-activation binding protein-1 (Jab1) which is responsible for phosphorylated p27 export from the nucleus. Corticotrophinomas are characterized by massively increased phosphorylation of p27 on Thr187, but are not associated with changes in Jab1. Macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF), which\nE4-ORF1 cellular targets. More importantly, the other two proteins in the list were novel, and their identities as the PI3K regulatory subunits p85\u03b1 and p85\u03b2 prompted additional experiments to confirm and extend the finding. We first used immunoblots to examine proteins recovered from a similar pulldown conducted with lysates of human MCF10A cells, an immortalized but non-transformed human mammary epithelial cell line retaining properties of normal breast epithelial cells. The results showed that GST-E4-ORF1 but not GST interacts with p85\u03b2 and the PI3K catalytic subunit p110\u03b1 and that neither GST protein associates with the cellular PDZ protein scribble ( Figure 1A ). Moreover, GST-E4-ORF1 but not GST also interacted with the purified, catalytically-active recombinant human p85\u03b1:p110\u03b1 heterodimer ( Figures 1B and 1C ). The low binding efficiency of GST-E4-ORF1 seen in these assays is a general property attributed to aggregation of this bacterially expressed fusion protein. These collective data indicated\ninterfaces. These findings importantly demonstrate that PI3K activation and cellular transformation induced by E4-ORF1 require two separate protein interaction elements, domain 2 and the PBM, each of which targets E4-ORF1 to vesicle membranes in cells. Selective PDZ protein-dependent stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase by the adenovirus E4-ORF1 oncoprotein. While PDZ domain-containing proteins represent cellular targets for several different viral oncoproteins, including human papillomavirus E6, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax, and human adenovirus E4-ORF1, the functional consequences for such interactions have not been elucidated. Here we report that, at the plasma membrane of cells, the adenovirus E4-ORF1 oncoprotein selectively and potently stimulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), triggering a downstream cascade of events that includes activation of both protein kinase B and p70S6-kinase. This activity of E4-ORF1 could be abrogated by overexpression of its PDZ-protein targets or by disruption of its PDZ domain-binding motif, which was shown to mediate complex formation between\nwith adenovirus E4-ORF1 and high-risk papillomavirus E6 oncoproteins Link of the unique oncogenic properties of adenovirus type 9 E4-ORF1 to a select interaction with the candidate tumor suppressor protein ZO-2 Viral oncoprotein-induced mislocalization of select PDZ proteins disrupts tight junctions and causes polarity defects in epithelial cells Multi-PDZ domain protein MUPP1 is a cellular target for both adenovirus E4-ORF1 and high-risk papillomavirus type 18 E6 oncoproteins Altered gap and tight junctions in human thyroid oncocytic tumors: a study of 8 cases by freeze-fracture Cell polarity as a regulator of cancer cell behavior plasticity Increased tight junctional permeability is associated with the development of colon cancer Cloning and characterization of hdlg: the human homologue of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor binds to protein 4.1 The PDZ protein discs-large (DLG): the \u2018Jekyll and Hyde\u2019 of the epithelial polarity proteins Oncogenic function for the Dlg1 mammalian homolog of the Drosophila discs-large tumor\nE4-ORF1-induced PI3K activation. To detect the low levels of E4-ORF1 protein produced in these transient transfection assays, we immunoblotted for E4-ORF1 in the RIPA buffer-insoluble cell pellet fraction, which contains 91%\u00b12.5% (n = 3 independent experiments) of E4-ORF1 protein expressed in MCF10A cells (Fig. S1). E4-ORF1 displays a similar cell fractionation profile in rodent fibroblasts. A control immunoblot also verified Dlg1 depletion in the Dlg1 shRNA-expressing MCF10A line ( Figure 4 , right panel). The data showed that E4-ORF1-induced PI3K activation is increased by HA-\u0394NT-Dlg1-I3 or decreased by HA-\u0394NT-Dlg1-I2 and that E4-ORF1-induced p110\u03b1 and p85\u03b1/\u03b2 protein elevation is enhanced similarly by either HA-\u0394NT-Dlg1-I3 or -I2 ( Figure 4 , left panel, compare lanes 2\u20134). From cumulative independent experiments, we quantified these effects induced by Dlg1-I3 (Table S5) or Dlg1-I2 (Table S6). Based on the findings, we concluded that, in Dlg1 shRNA-expressing MCF10A cells, Dlg1-I3 expression restores E4-ORF1-induced PI3K activation whereas\nNY: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. pp. 205\u2013296.

Interestingly, we have also found a distinct difference in G protein coupling between the two splice variants of GABA(B)1. Our data reveal selective pathways of receptor activation through different G(i/oalpha) isoforms for stimulation of the G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K(+) channel. G-protein mediated gating of inward-rectifier K+ channels. G-protein regulated inward-rectifier potassium channels (GIRK) are part of a superfamily of inward-rectifier K+ channels which includes seven family members. To date four GIRK subunits, designated GIRK1-4 (also designated Kir3.1-4), have been identified in mammals, and GIRK5 has been found in Xenopus oocytes. GIRK channels exist in vivo both as homotetramers and heterotetramers. In contrast to the other mammalian GIRK family members, GIRK1 can not form functional channels by itself and has to assemble with GIRK2, 3 or 4. As the name implies, GIRK channels are modulated by G-proteins; they\nPIP2 activates them in minutes without Gbetagamma and in just seconds with Gbetagamma. Finally, coexpression of Gbetagamma with GIRK channels slows the inhibition of K+ currents by PIP2 antibodies by more than 10-fold. Thus Gbetagamma activates GIRK channels by stabilizing interactions between PIP2 and the K+ channel. Single channel studies of inward rectifier potassium channel regulation by muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Negative regulation of the heartbeat rate involves the activation of an inwardly rectifying potassium current (I(KACh)) by G protein-coupled receptors such as the m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. Recent studies have shown that this process involves the direct binding of G(betagamma) subunits to the NH(2)- and COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domains of the proteins termed GIRK1 and GIRK4 (Kir3.1 and Kir3.4/CIR), which mediate I(KACh). Because of the very low basal activity of native I(KACh), it has been difficult to determine the single channel effect of G(betagamma) subunit binding on I(KACh) activity. Through analysis\nwas less potent than the wild type beta(1)gamma(2). Additionally we tested four beta(1) mutants in which mutated residues are located in the top Galpha/beta interacting surface. Among them, mutant W332A showed far less ability than the wild type to activate GIRK channels. These results suggest that the outer surface of blade 1 and blade 2 of the beta subunit might specifically interact with GIRK and that the beta subunit interacts with GIRK both over the outer surface and over the top Galpha interacting surface. Identification of G protein-coupled, inward rectifier potassium channel gene products from the rat anterior pituitary gland. Dopamine (DA) is a physiological regulator of PRL secretion, exerting tonic inhibitory control. DA activates an inward rectifier K(+) (IRK) channel in rat lactotropes, causing membrane hyperpolarization and inhibition of Ca(2+)-dependent action potentials. Both the activation of this effector K(+) channel and the inhibition of PRL release are mediated by\nK+ channels. Mutation of critical GIRK subunit residues disrupts N- and C-termini association and channel function. The subfamily of G-protein-linked inwardly rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs) is coupled to G-protein receptors throughout the CNS and in the heart. We used mutational analysis to address the role of a specific hydrophobic region of the GIRK1 subunit. Deletion of the GIRK1 C-terminal residues 330-384, as well as the point mutation I331R, resulted in a decrease in channel function when coexpressed with GIRK4 in oocytes and in COS-7 cells. Surface protein expression of GIRK1 I331R coexpressed with GIRK4 was comparable with wild type, indicating that subunits assemble and are correctly localized to the membrane. Subsequent mutation of homologous residues in both the GIRK4 subunit and Kir2.1 (Gbetagamma-independent inward rectifier) also resulted in a decrease in channel function. Intracellular domain associations resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of the GIRK1 N and C termini and GIRK4 N\ncells. uKATP-1 and BIR form with sulfonylurea receptors, the so-called ATP-sensitive K+ channels. Thus, it is a feature of the Kir channel family that each subfamily plays a specific physiological functional role. The (Na+)-activated Kir channels identified electrophysiologically in neurons and cardiac myocytes have not yet been cloned. In this review, we overviewed the current understandings of the features of the molecular structures and functions of the four main subfamilies of Kir channels. Structural basis for modulation of gating property of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium ion channel (GIRK) by i/o-family G protein \u03b1 subunit (G\u03b1i/o). G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channel (GIRK) plays a crucial role in regulating heart rate and neuronal excitability. The gating of GIRK is regulated by the association and dissociation of G protein \u03b2\u03b3 subunits (G\u03b2\u03b3), which are released from pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein \u03b1 subunit (G\u03b1(i/o)) upon GPCR activation in vivo. Several lines of\nI(KACh), it has been difficult to determine the single channel effect of G(betagamma) subunit binding on I(KACh) activity. Through analysis of a novel G protein-activated chimeric inward rectifier channel that displays increased basal activity relative to I(KACh), we find that single channel activation can be explained by a G protein-dependent shift in the equilibrium of open channel transitions in favor of a bursting state of channel activity over a long-lived closed state. The Stoichiometry of Gbeta gamma binding to G-protein-regulated inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRKs). G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K(+) (GIRK; Kir3.x) channels are the primary effectors of numerous G-protein-coupled receptors. GIRK channels decrease cellular excitability by hyperpolarizing the membrane potential in cardiac cells, neurons, and secretory cells. Although direct regulation of GIRKs by the heterotrimeric G-protein subunit Gbetagamma has been extensively studied, little is known about the number of Gbetagamma binding sites per channel. Here we demonstrate that purified GIRK\nand GIRK3/Kir 3.3). Here we report that GIRK2 but not GIRK3 can be activated by G protein subunits G beta 1 and G gamma 2 in Xenopus oocytes. Furthermore, when either GIRK3 or GIRK2 was coexpressed with GIRK1 and activated either by muscarinic receptors or by G beta gamma subunits, G-protein-mediated inward currents were increased by 5- to 40-fold. The single-channel conductance for GIRK1 plus GIRK2 coexpression was intermediate between those for GIRK1 alone and for GIRK2 alone, and voltage-jump kinetics for the coexpressed channels displayed new kinetic properties. On the other hand, coexpression of GIRK3 with GIRK2 suppressed the GIRK2 alone response. These studies suggest that formation of heteromultimers involving the several GIRKs is an important mechanism for generating diversity in expression level and function of neurotransmitter-coupled, inward rectifier K+ channels. Mutation of critical GIRK subunit residues disrupts N- and C-termini association and channel function. The subfamily of G-protein-linked\nGIRK1d (positions according to GIRK1a primary structure).CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides insight into the cellular and molecular consequences of KCNJ3 overexpression in breast cancer cells and the mechanism upon clinical outcome in patients suffering from breast cancer. NMR analyses of the Gbetagamma binding and conformational rearrangements of the cytoplasmic pore of G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium channel 1 (GIRK1). G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium channel (GIRK) plays crucial roles in regulating heart rate and neuronal excitability in eukaryotic cells. GIRK is activated by the direct binding of heterotrimeric G protein \u03b2\u03b3 subunits (G\u03b2\u03b3) upon stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors, such as M2 acetylcholine receptor. The binding of G\u03b2\u03b3 to the cytoplasmic pore (CP) region of GIRK causes structural rearrangements, which are assumed to open the transmembrane ion gate. However, the crucial residues involved in the G\u03b2\u03b3 binding and the structural mechanism of GIRK gating have not been fully elucidated. Here,\nextensively studied, little is known about the number of Gbetagamma binding sites per channel. Here we demonstrate that purified GIRK (Kir 3.x) tetramers can be chemically cross-linked to exogenously purified Gbetagamma subunits. The observed laddering pattern of Gbetagamma attachment to GIRK4 homotetramers was consistent with the binding of one, two, three, or four Gbetagamma molecules per channel tetramer. The fraction of channels chemically cross-linked to four Gbetagamma molecules increased with increasing Gbetagamma concentrations and approached saturation. These results suggest that GIRK tetrameric channels have four Gbetagamma binding sites. Thus, GIRK (Kir 3.x) channels, like the distantly related cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, are tetramers and exhibit a 1:1 subunit/ligand binding stoichiometry. Structural basis for the ethanol action on G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium channel 1 revealed by NMR spectroscopy. Ethanol consumption leads to a wide range of pharmacological effects by acting on the signaling proteins in the human nervous system, such as ion\ngave an apparent K(d) similar to that for DA binding in anterior pituitary tissue. GIRK1 and GIRK4 proteins were coimmunoprecipitated from anterior pituitary lysates, confirming the presence of native GIRK1/GIRK4 oligomers in this tissue. These data indicate that GIRK1 and GIRK4 are excellent candidate subunits for the D(2)-activated, G protein-gated channel in pituitary lactotropes, where they play a critical role in excitation-secretion coupling. Evidence that neuronal G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channels are activated by G beta gamma subunits and function as heteromultimers. Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) activate K+ conductances in cardiac atrial cells to slow heart rate and in neurons to decrease excitability. cDNAs encoding three isoforms of a G-protein-coupled, inwardly rectifying K+ channel (GIRK) have recently been cloned from cardiac (GIRK1/Kir 3.1) and brain cDNA libraries (GIRK2/Kir 3.2 and GIRK3/Kir 3.3). Here we report that GIRK2 but not GIRK3 can be activated by G protein subunits G beta\nInteraction sites of the G protein beta subunit with brain G protein-coupled inward rectifier K+ channel. G protein-coupled inward rectifier K(+) channels (GIRK channels) are activated directly by the G protein betagamma subunit. The crystal structure of the G protein betagamma subunits reveals that the beta subunit consists of an N-terminal alpha helix followed by a symmetrical seven-bladed propeller structure. Each blade is made up of four antiparallel beta strands. The top surface of the propeller structure interacts with the Galpha subunit. The outer surface of the betagamma torus is largely made from outer beta strands of the propeller. We analyzed the interaction between the beta subunit and brain GIRK channels by mutating the outer surface of the betagamma torus. Mutants of the outer surface of the beta(1) subunit were generated by replacing the sequences at the outer beta strands of each blade with corresponding sequences of the yeast beta\nnew family of K+ channels whose subunits contain two putative transmembrane domains and a pore-forming region. So far, more than ten cDNAs of Kir channel subunits have been isolated and classified into four subfamilies: 1) IRK subfamily (IRK1-3/Kir1.1-1.3), 2) GIRK subfamily (GIRK1-4/Kir3.1-3.4), 3) ATP-dependent Kir subfamily (ROMK1/Kir1.1, K(AB)-2/Kir4.1), and 4) ATP-sensitive Kir subfamily (uKATP-1/Kir6.1, BIR/Kir6.2). Xenopus oocytes injected with the cRNAs of IRKs elicit classical Kir channel currents. GIRKs, as heteromultimers, compose the G protein-gated Kir (KG) channels, which are regulated by a variety of Gi/Go-coupled inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors such as m2-mus-carinic, serotonergic (5HT1A), GABAB, somatostatin and opioid (mu, delta, kappa) receptors. ROMK1 and KAB-2 are characterized with a Walker type-A ATP-binding motif in their carboxyl termini, and may be involved in K+ transport in renal epithelial and brain glial cells. uKATP-1 and BIR form with sulfonylurea receptors, the so-called ATP-sensitive K+ channels. Thus, it is a feature of the\ncholesterol-rich microdomains (lipid rafts) in CHO cells and in isolated brain membranes. Mutational and pharmacological disruption of the lipid raft association of NCAM140 normalizes surface delivery of channels. We conclude that the transmembrane isoforms of NCAM reduce the transport of Kir3 channels to the cell surface via lipid rafts. Thus, regulation of Kir3 channel activity by NCAM may represent a novel mechanism controlling long-term excitability of neurons. Interaction of G protein beta subunit with inward rectifier K(+) channel Kir3. G protein betagamma subunits bind and activate G protein-coupled inward rectifier K+ (GIRK) channels. This protein-protein interaction is crucial for slow hyperpolarizations of cardiac myocytes and neurons. The crystal structure of Gbeta shows a seven-bladed propeller with four beta strands in each blade. The Gbeta/Galpha interacting surface contains sites for activating GIRK channels. Furthermore, our recent investigation using chimeras between Gbeta1 and yeast beta (STE4) suggested that the outer strands of\nblocker NIP-151 repressed the increased current and improved bradyarrhythmia phenotypes in the mutant zebrafish.CONCLUSIONS: The IKACh channel is associated with the pathophysiology of bradyarrhythmia and atrial fibrillation, and the mutant IKACh channel ( KCNJ3 p.N83H) can be effectively inhibited by NIP-151, a selective IKACh channel blocker. Thus, the IKACh channel might be considered to be a suitable pharmacological target for patients who have bradyarrhythmia with a gain-of-function mutation in the IKACh channel. The role of members of the pertussis toxin-sensitive family of G proteins in coupling receptors to the activation of the G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channel. Inwardly rectifying potassium (K(+)) channels gated by G proteins (Kir3.x family) are widely distributed in neuronal, atrial, and endocrine tissues and play key roles in generating late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, slowing the heart rate and modulating hormone release. They are directly activated by G(betagamma) subunits released from G protein heterotrimers of the\nG\u03b1 and the \u03b1A helix of GIRK. In addition, the TCS and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement results suggested that the helical domain of G\u03b1 transiently interacts with the \u03b1A helix of GIRK. Based on these results, we built a docking model of G\u03b1 and GIRK, suggesting the molecular basis for efficient GIRK deactivation by G\u03b1(i/o). Direct activation of inward rectifier potassium channels by PIP2 and its stabilization by Gbetagamma. Inward rectifier K+ channels, which modulate electrical activity in many cell types, are regulated by protein kinases, guanine-nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and probably actin cytoskeleton. Generation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) by ATP-dependent lipid kinases is known to activate inward rectifier K+ channels in cardiac membrane patches. Here we report that several cloned inward rectifier K+ channels directly bind PIP2, and that this binding correlates with channel activity. Application of ATP or PIP2 liposomes activates the cloned channels. Stabilized by lipid phosphatase inhibitors,\nof the GIRK (G-protein activated inwardly rectifying K+ channel). Thus, human cardiac GIRK channels are important for heart rate regulation and subsequently, genes encoding their subunits Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 ( KCNJ3 and KCNJ5) are potential candidates for inherited SND in human.METHODS: We performed a combined approach of targeted sequencing of KCNJ3 and KCNJ5 in 52 patients with idiopathic SND and subsequent whole exome sequencing of additional family members in a genetically affected patient. A putative novel disease-associated gene variant was functionally analyzed by voltage-clamp experiments using various heterologous cell expression systems (Xenopus oocytes, CHO cells, and rat atrial cardiomyocytes).RESULTS: In a 3-generation family with SND we identified a novel variant in KCNJ5 which leads to an amino acid substitution (p.Trp101Cys) in the first transmembrane domain of the Kir3.4 subunit of the cardiac GIRK channel. The identified variant cosegregated with the disease in the family and was absent in the Exome\nsequencing. Expression of each of these gene products in anterior pituitary was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. Functional analysis of the GIRK proteins was performed in the heterologous expression system, Xenopus laevis oocytes. Macroscopic K(+) currents were examined in oocytes injected with different combinations of Kir 3.0 complementary RNA (cRNA) and G protein subunit (beta(1)gamma(2)) cRNA. The current-voltage relationships demonstrated strong inward rectification for each individual and pairwise combination of GIRK channel subunits. Oocytes coinjected with any pair of GIRK subunit cRNA exhibited significantly larger inward K(+) currents than oocytes injected with only one GIRK channel subtype. Ligand-dependent activation of only one of the GIRK combinations (GIRK1 and GIRK4) was observed when channel subunits were coexpressed with the D(2) receptor in Xenopus oocytes. Dose-response data fit to a Michaelis-Menten equation gave an apparent K(d) similar to that for DA binding in anterior pituitary tissue. GIRK1 and GIRK4 proteins were coimmunoprecipitated\nheart rate and modulating hormone release. They are directly activated by G(betagamma) subunits released from G protein heterotrimers of the G(i/o) family upon appropriate receptor stimulation. Here we examine the role of isoforms of pertussis toxin (PTx)-sensitive G protein alpha subunits (G(ialpha1-3) and G(oalphaA)) in mediating coupling between various receptor systems (A(1), alpha(2A), D(2S), M(4), GABA(B)1a+2, and GABA(B)1b+2) and the cloned counterpart of the neuronal channel (Kir3.1+3.2A). The expression of mutant PTx-resistant G(i/oalpha) subunits in PTx-treated HEK293 cells stably expressing Kir3.1+3.2A allows us to selectively investigate that coupling. We find that, for those receptors (A(1), alpha(2A)) known to interact with all isoforms, G(ialpha1-3) and G(oalphaA) can all support a significant degree of coupling to Kir3.1+3.2A. The M(4) receptor appears to preferentially couple to G(ialpha2) while another group of receptors (D(2S), GABA(B)1a+2, GABA(B)1b+2) activates the channel predominantly through G(betagamma) liberated from G(oA) heterotrimers. Interestingly, we have also found a distinct difference\none heterozygous mutation, KCNJ3 c.247A>C, p.N83H, as a novel cause of hereditary bradyarrhythmias in this family. KCNJ3 encodes the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir3.1, which combines with Kir3.4 (encoded by KCNJ5) to form the acetylcholine-activated potassium channel ( IKACh channel) with specific expression in the atrium. An additional study using a genome cohort of 2185 patients with sporadic atrial fibrillation revealed another 5 rare mutations in KCNJ3 and KCNJ5, suggesting the relevance of both genes to these arrhythmias. Cellular electrophysiological studies revealed that the KCNJ3 p.N83H mutation caused a gain of IKACh channel function by increasing the basal current, even in the absence of m2 muscarinic receptor stimulation. We generated transgenic zebrafish expressing mutant human KCNJ3 in the atrium specifically. It is interesting to note that the selective IKACh channel blocker NIP-151 repressed the increased current and improved bradyarrhythmia phenotypes in the mutant zebrafish.CONCLUSIONS: The IKACh channel is associated with\nwith GIRK channels. Our study suggests a mechanism by which different effectors use different blades to achieve divergence of signaling. We also observed that substitution of alanine for Trp-332 of Gbeta1 impaired the functional interaction of Gbeta1 with GIRK, in agreement with the data on native neuronal GIRK channels. Trp-332 plays a critical role in the interaction of Gbeta1 with Galpha as well as all effectors so far tested. Familial Sinus Node Disease Caused by a Gain of GIRK (G-Protein Activated Inwardly Rectifying K+ Channel) Channel Function. BACKGROUND: Inherited forms of sinus node dysfunction (SND) clinically include bradycardia, sinus arrest, and chronotropic incompetence and may serve as disease models to understand sinus node physiology and impulse generation. Recently, a gain-of-function mutation in the G-protein gene GNB2 led to enhanced activation of the GIRK (G-protein activated inwardly rectifying K+ channel). Thus, human cardiac GIRK channels are important for heart rate regulation",

        "desc": "Functional interaction between trace amine-associated receptor 1 and dopamine D2 receptor. The ability of dopamine receptors to interact with other receptor subtypes may provide mechanisms for modulating dopamine-related functions and behaviors. In particular, there is evidence suggesting that the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) affects the dopaminergic system by regulating the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons or by altering dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) responsiveness to ligands. TAAR1 is a G\u03b1(s) protein-coupled receptor that is activated by biogenic amines, \"trace amines,\" such as \u03b2-phenylethylamine (\u03b2-PEA) and tyramine that are normally found at low concentrations in the mammalian brain. In the present study, we investigated the biochemical mechanism of interaction between TAAR1 and D2R and the role this interaction plays in D2R-related signaling and behaviors. Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer biosensor for cAMP, we demonstrated that the D2R antagonists haloperidol, raclopride, and amisulpride were able to enhance selectively a TAAR1-mediated \u03b2-PEA\namines resulting from decarboxylation of aromatic acids, including dopamine (DA), norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin (5-HT), and histamine, other biogenic amines, present at much lower concentrations in the central nervous system (CNS), and hence referred to as \"trace\" amines (TAs), are now recognized to play significant neurophysiological and behavioral functions. At the turn of the century, the discovery of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a phylogenetically conserved G protein-coupled receptor that is responsive to both TAs, such as \u03b2-phenylethylamine, octopamine, and tyramine, and structurally-related amphetamines, unveiled mechanisms of action for TAs other than interference with aminergic pathways, laying the foundations for deciphering the functional significance of TAs and its mammalian CNS receptor, TAAR1. Although, its molecular interactions and downstream targets have not been fully elucidated, TAAR1 activation triggers accumulation of intracellular cAMP, modulates PKA and PKC signaling and interferes with the \u03b2-arrestin2-dependent pathway via G protein-independent mechanisms. TAAR1 is uniquely positioned\nfor cAMP, we demonstrated that the D2R antagonists haloperidol, raclopride, and amisulpride were able to enhance selectively a TAAR1-mediated \u03b2-PEA increase of cAMP. Moreover, TAAR1 and D2R were able to form heterodimers when coexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and this direct interaction was disrupted in the presence of haloperidol. In addition, in mice lacking TAAR1, haloperidol-induced striatal c-Fos expression and catalepsy were significantly reduced. Taken together, these data suggest that TAAR1 and D2R have functional and physical interactions that could be critical for the modulation of the dopaminergic system by TAAR1 in vivo. Trace Amines and the Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1: Pharmacology, Neurochemistry, and Clinical Implications. Biogenic amines are a collection of endogenous molecules that play pivotal roles as neurotransmitters and hormones. In addition to the \"classical\" biogenic amines resulting from decarboxylation of aromatic acids, including dopamine (DA), norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin (5-HT), and histamine, other biogenic amines, present\ncAMP, modulates PKA and PKC signaling and interferes with the \u03b2-arrestin2-dependent pathway via G protein-independent mechanisms. TAAR1 is uniquely positioned to exert direct control over DA and 5-HT neuronal firing and release, which has profound implications for understanding the pathophysiology of, and therefore designing more efficacious therapeutic interventions for, a range of neuropsychiatric disorders that involve aminergic dysregulation, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, mood disorders, and addiction. Indeed, the recent development of novel pharmacological tools targeting TAAR1 has uncovered the remarkable potential of TAAR1-based medications as new generation pharmacotherapies in neuropsychiatry. This review summarizes recent developments in the study of TAs and TAAR1, their intricate neurochemistry and pharmacology, and their relevance for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease.",

Extra-subfamily delayed rectifier \u03b1-subunits, regardless of their capacity to interact with KCNE1 and KCNE2, cannot rescue Kv1.4 or Kv3.4 surface expression unless engineered to interact with them using N-terminal A and B domain swapping. The KCNE1/2-enforced checkpoint ensures N-type \u03b1-subunits only reach the cell surface as part of intra-subfamily mixed-\u03b1 complexes, thereby governing channel composition, inactivation rate, and-by extension-cellular excitability. Structural and functional characterization of Kv6.2 a new gamma-subunit of voltage-gated potassium channel. We have cloned and functionally expressed Kv6.2, a new member of the Kv6 subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channel subunits. The human Kv6.2 (KCNF2) gene was mapped at 18q22-18q23. Kv6.2 mRNA is preferentially expressed in rat and human myocard. Rat and human Kv6.2 subunits appear to be unable to form functional Kv channels in a heterologous expression system, but, when coexpressed with Kv2.1 alpha\nlocalization but not surface expression, while inclusion of Kv1.2 imparted clustering at presynaptic sites and decreased channel mobility within the axon. This mechanism by which specific Kv channel subunits can act in a dominant manner to impose unique trafficking properties to heteromeric complexes extended to Shab-related family of Kv channels. When coexpressed, Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 heteromultimers did not aggregate in somatodendritic clusters observed with expression of Kv2.1 alone. These studies demonstrate selective axonal trafficking and surface localization of distinct Kv channels based on their subunit composition. Structural determinants of the regulation of the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv2.1 by the modulatory \u03b1-subunit Kv9.3. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels containing alpha-subunits of the Kv2 subfamily mediate delayed rectifier currents in excitable cells. Channels formed by Kv2.1 alpha-subunits inactivate from open- and closed states with both forms of inactivation serving different physiological functions. Here we show that open- and closed-state inactivation of Kv2.1 can\nof voltage-gated potassium channels in human neurodevelopmental disorders, such as epileptic encephalopathy. The N- and C-terminal domains of \u03b1-subunits interact to form the cytoplasmic subunit of heterotetrameric potassium channels that regulate electric pores. Subsequent animal studies revealed the developmental functions of Kcnb1-containing voltage-gated potassium channels and illustrated their role during brain development and reproduction. These functions of potassium channels are discussed in this review in the context of regulatory interactions between electrically-active and regulatory subunits. Heteromultimeric potassium channels formed by members of the Kv2 subfamily. Four alpha-subunits are thought to coassemble and form a voltage-dependent potassium (Kv) channel. Kv alpha-subunits belong to one of four major subfamilies (Kv1, Kv2, Kv3, Kv4). Within a subfamily up to eight different genetic isotypes exist (e.g., Kv1.1, Kv1.2). Different isotypes within the Kv1 or Kv3 subfamily coassemble. It is not known, however, whether the only two members of the vertebrate Kv2 subfamily identified thus\nKv3 subfamily coassemble. It is not known, however, whether the only two members of the vertebrate Kv2 subfamily identified thus far, Kv2.1 and Kv2.2, heteromultimerize. This might account for the lack of detection of heteromultimeric Kv2 channels in situ despite the coexpression of Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 mRNAs within the same cell. To probe whether Kv2 isotypes can form heteromultimers, we developed a dominant-negative mutant Kv2.2 subunit to act as a molecular poison of Kv2 subunit-containing channels. The dominant-negative Kv2.2 suppresses formation of functional channels when it is coexpressed in oocytes with either wild-type Kv2.2 or Kv2.1 subunits. These results indicate that Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 subunits are capable of heteromultimerization. Thus, in native cells either Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 subunits are targeted at an early stage to different biosynthetic compartments or heteromultimerization otherwise is inhibited. Assembly of voltage-gated potassium channels. Conserved hydrophilic motifs determine subfamily-specific interactions between the alpha-subunits. Voltage-gated potassium (K+)\nin human photoreceptor function and suggest that the visual deficits in patients with KCNV2 mutations arise from inadequate resting activation of KV channels in rod and cone inner segments.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Mutations in a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit, KV8.2, underlie a blinding inherited photoreceptor dystrophy, indicating an important role for these channels in human vision. Here, we have defined the localization and subunit interactions of KV8.2 channels in primate photoreceptors. We show that the KV8.2 subunit interacts with different Kv2 channels in rods and cones, giving rise to potassium currents with distinct functional properties. Our results provide a molecular basis for retinal dysfunction in patients with mutations in the KCNV2 gene encoding KV8.2. Delayed rectifier K+ currents, IK, are encoded by Kv2 alpha-subunits and regulate tonic firing in mammalian sympathetic neurons. Previous studies have revealed the presence of four kinetically distinct voltage-gated K+ currents, I(Af), I(As), I(K), and I(SS), in rat\nKv4 subfamilies each associate to form homomultimers. Using the yeast two-hybrid system and eight K+ channel genes, two genes (one isolated from rat and one from Drosophila) from each subfamily, we demonstrated that the associations to form heteromultimers by the NH2-terminal domains are strictly subfamily-specific. These subfamily-specific associations suggest a molecular basis for the selective formation of heteromultimeric channels in vivo.

The Kv2 family of voltage-gated potassium channel \u03b1 subunits, comprising Kv2.1 and Kv2.2, mediate the bulk of the neuronal delayed rectifier K(+) current in many mammalian central neurons. Kv2.1 exhibits robust expression across many neuron types and is unique in its conditional role in modulating intrinsic excitability through changes in its phosphorylation state, which affect Kv2.1 expression, localization, and function. Much less is known of the highly related Kv2.2 subunit, especially in\nfluorescent protein (EGFP)] were introduced into SCG neurons. Whole-cell recordings from EGFP-positive Kv2.1DN or Kv2.2DN-expressing cells revealed selective decreases in I(K). Coexpression of Kv2.1DN and Kv2.2DN eliminates I(K) in most (75%) SCG cells and, in the remaining (25%) cells, I(K) density is reduced. Together with biochemical data revealing that Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 alpha-subunits do not associate in rat SCGs, these results suggest that Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 form distinct populations of I(K) channels, and that Kv2 alpha-subunits underlie (most of) I(K) in SCG neurons. Similar to wild-type cells, phasic, adapting, and tonic firing patterns are evident in SCG cells expressing Kv2.1DN or Kv2.2DN, although action potential durations in tonic cells are prolonged. Expression of Kv2.2DN also results in membrane depolarization, suggesting that Kv2.1- and Kv2.2-encoded I(K) channels play distinct roles in regulating the excitability of SCG neurons. KCNE1 and KCNE2 provide a checkpoint governing voltage-gated potassium channel \u03b1-subunit composition. Voltage-gated potassium\nA double-point mutation in the selectivity filter site of the KCNQ1 potassium channel results in a severe phenotype, LQT1, of long QT syndrome. INTRODUCTION: Slowly activating delayed-rectifier potassium currents in the heart are produced by a complex protein with alpha and beta subunits composed of the potassium voltage-gated channel KQT-like subfamily, member 1 (KCNQ1) and the potassium voltage-gated channel Isk-related family, member 1 (KCNE1), respectively. Mutations in KCNQ1 underlie the most common type of hereditary long QT syndrome (LQTS). Like other potassium channels, KCNQ1 has six transmembrane domains and a highly conserved potassium selectivity filter in the pore helix called \"the signature sequence.\" We aimed to investigate the functional consequences of a newly identified mutation within the signature sequence.METHODS AND RESULTS: Potassium channel genomic DNA from a family with clinical evidence of LQTS was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the resulting products were then sequenced. Three family members\nappear to be unable to form functional Kv channels in a heterologous expression system, but, when coexpressed with Kv2.1 alpha subunits, heteromultimeric Kv channels were formed mediating voltage-activated delayed-rectifier type outward currents. Their kinetics and conductance-voltage relationship were different from those mediated by homomultimeric Kv2.1 channels. Yeast two-hybrid reporter assays indicated that Kv6.2 amino-termini are able to interact specifically with the Kv2.1 amino-terminus. It is proposed that this protein protein interaction underlies Kv2.1/Kv6.2 subunit assembly and the expression of functional heteromultimeric Kv2.1/Kv6.2 channels. The most resiliant feature of the Kv2.1/Kv6.2 channels was their submicromolar sensitivity to the antiarrhythmic drug propafenone. The data suggest that delayed-rectifier type channels containing Kv6.2 subunits may contribute to cardiac action potential repolarization. Impact of ancillary subunits on ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels generate the outward K(+) ion currents that constitute the primary force in ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium channels comprise tetramers of pore-forming alpha\nKv2 clusters in situ, only 20% of Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 channels conducted potassium. We also show for the first time that Kv1.4 and Kv1.5 exhibit density-dependent silencing, suggesting that this phenomenon has an underlying mechanism that is shared by Kv channels from multiple families. Kv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels in developmental perspective. Kv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels consist of two types of \u03b1-subunits: (a) electrically-active Kcnb1 \u03b1-subunits and (b) silent or modulatory \u03b1-subunits plus \u03b2-subunits that, similar to silent \u03b1-subunits, also regulate electrically-active subunits. Voltage-gated potassium channels were traditionally viewed, mainly by electrophysiologists, as regulators of the electrical activity of the plasma membrane in excitable cells, a role that is performed by transmembrane protein domains of \u03b1-subunits that form the electric pore. Genetic studies revealed a role for this region of \u03b1-subunits of voltage-gated potassium channels in human neurodevelopmental disorders, such as epileptic encephalopathy. The N- and C-terminal domains of \u03b1-subunits interact\ndiabetes. Carboxyl tail region of the Kv2.2 subunit mediates novel developmental regulation of channel density. Molecular mechanisms underlying the acquisition of stable electrical phenotypes in developing neurons remain poorly defined. As Xenopus embryonic spinal neurons mature, they initially exhibit dramatic changes in excitability due to a threefold increase in voltage-gated potassium current (IKv) density. Later when mature neurons begin synapse formation, IKv density remains stable. Elevation of Kv1.1 and Kv2.1 RNA levels indicates that excess transcript levels of these Kv genes can increase current density in both young and mature neurons. In contrast, Kv2.2 overexpression increases IKv density in young but not mature neurons despite the presence of protein translated from injected RNA at this stage. Because protein domains can determine biophysical as well as subcellular localization properties of channel subunits, we tested whether a region of the Kv2.2 subunit regulated functional expression in mature neurons. We focused on the\nin macrophages. Thus, lipopolysaccharide-induced activation increases Kv1.3 and KCNE4 mRNA, whereas dexamethasone triggers a decrease in Kv1.3 with no changes in KCNE4. The channelosome composition determines the activity and affects surface expression and membrane localization. Therefore, KCNE4 association might play a crucial role in controlling immunological responses. Our results indicate that KCNE ancillary subunits could be new targets for immunomodulation. Heteromeric KV2/KV8.2 Channels Mediate Delayed Rectifier Potassium Currents in Primate Photoreceptors. Silent voltage-gated potassium channel subunits (KVS) interact selectively with members of the KV2 channel family to modify their functional properties. The localization and functional roles of these silent subunits remain poorly understood. Mutations in the KVS subunit, KV8.2 (KCNV2), lead to severe visual impairment in humans, but the basis of these deficits remains unclear. Here, we examined the localization, native interactions, and functional properties of KV8.2-containing channels in mouse, macaque, and human photoreceptors of either sex. In human retina,\n3 (KCND3), encoding the K+ channel, Kv4.3, are associated with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 19, allelic with SCA22. Mutations in potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily C member 3 (KCNC3), encoding another K+ channel, Kv3.3, cause SCA13. First, a comprehensive phenotype assessment was carried out in a family with autosomal dominant ataxia harboring 2 genetic variants in KCNC3 and KCND3. To evaluate the physiological impact of these variants on channel currents, in vitro studies were performed.METHODS: Clinical and psychometric evaluations, neuroimaging, and genotyping of a family (mother and son) affected by ataxia were carried out. Heterozygous and homozygous Kv3.3 A671V and Kv4.3 V374A variants were evaluated in Xenopus laevis oocytes using 2-electrode voltage-clamp. The influence of Kv4 conductance on neuronal activity was investigated computationally using a Purkinje neuron model.RESULTS: The main clinical findings were consistent with adult-onset ataxia with cognitive dysfunction and acetazolamide-responsive paroxysmal motor exacerbations in the index case. Despite cognitive deficits,\notherwise is inhibited. Assembly of voltage-gated potassium channels. Conserved hydrophilic motifs determine subfamily-specific interactions between the alpha-subunits. Voltage-gated potassium (K+) channels are assembled by four identical or homologous alpha-subunits to form a tetrameric complex with a central conduction pore for potassium ions. Most of the cloned genes for the alpha-subunits are classified into four subfamilies: Kv1 (Shaker), Kv2 (Shab), Kv3 (Shaw), and Kv4 (Shal). Subfamily-specific assembly of heteromeric K+ channel complexes has been observed in vitro and in vivo, which contributes to the diversity of K+ currents. However, the molecular codes that mediate the subfamily-specific association remain unknown. To understand the molecular basis of the subfamily-specific assembly, we tested the protein-protein interactions of different regions of alpha-subunits. We report here that the cytoplasmic NH2-terminal domains of Kv1, Kv2, Kv3, and Kv4 subfamilies each associate to form homomultimers. Using the yeast two-hybrid system and eight K+ channel genes, two genes (one\nof channel function, leading to a long QT interval and subsequent syncope. Subunit-dependent axonal trafficking of distinct alpha heteromeric potassium channel complexes. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels are critical for neuronal excitability and are targeted to specific subcellular compartments to carry out their unique functions. While it is widely believed that Kv channels exist as heteromeric complexes in neurons, direct tests of the hypothesis that specific heteromeric channel populations display divergent spatial and temporal dynamics are limited. Using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation approach, we monitored the assembly and localization of cell surface channel complexes in living cells. While PSD95-mediated clustering was subunit independent, selective visualization of heteromeric Kv complexes in rat hippocampal neurons revealed subunit-dependent localization that was not predicted by analyzing individual subunits. Assembly of Kv1.1 with Kv1.4 prevented axonal localization but not surface expression, while inclusion of Kv1.2 imparted clustering at presynaptic sites and decreased channel mobility within the\nregulating the excitability of SCG neurons. KCNE1 and KCNE2 provide a checkpoint governing voltage-gated potassium channel \u03b1-subunit composition. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) currents generated by N-type \u03b1-subunit homotetramers inactivate rapidly because an N-terminal ball domain blocks the channel pore after activation. Hence, the inactivation rate of heterotetrameric channels comprising both N-type and non-N-type (delayed rectifier) \u03b1-subunits depends upon the number of N-type \u03b1-subunits in the complex. As Kv channel inactivation and inactivation recovery rates regulate cellular excitability, the composition and expression of these heterotetrameric complexes are expected to be tightly regulated. In a companion article, we showed that the single transmembrane segment ancillary (\u03b2) subunits KCNE1 and KCNE2 suppress currents generated by homomeric Kv1.4, Kv3.3, and Kv3.4 channels, by trapping them early in the secretory pathway. Here, we show that this trapping is prevented by coassembly of the N-type \u03b1-subunits with intra-subfamily delayed rectifier \u03b1-subunits. Extra-subfamily delayed rectifier \u03b1-subunits, regardless of\ninhibitor of Kv2 channels, whereas HmTx1 also inhibits Kv4 channels, including Kv4.1, with the same potency. HmTx1 is the first described peptide effector of the Kv4.1 subtype. Those novel toxins are new tools for the investigation of the physiological role of the different potassium channel subunits in cellular physiology. Kv2 Ion Channels Determine the Expression and Localization of the Associated AMIGO-1 Cell Adhesion Molecule in Adult Brain Neurons. Voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels play important roles in regulating neuronal excitability. Kv channels comprise four principal \u03b1 subunits, and transmembrane and/or cytoplasmic auxiliary subunits that modify diverse aspects of channel function. AMIGO-1, which mediates homophilic cell adhesion underlying neurite outgrowth and fasciculation during development, has recently been shown to be an auxiliary subunit of adult brain Kv2.1-containing Kv channels. We show that AMIGO-1 is extensively colocalized with both Kv2.1 and its paralog Kv2.2 in brain neurons across diverse mammals, and that in\nthree disulfide bridges. Electrophysiological recordings in COS cells show that these toxins act as gating modifier of voltage-dependent K+ channels. ScTx1 is the first high-affinity inhibitor of the Kv2.2 channel subtype (IC50, 21.4 nM) to be described. ScTx1 also inhibits the Kv2.1 channels, with an IC50 of 12.7 nM, and Kv2.1/Kv9.3 heteromultimers that have been proposed to be involved in O2 sensing in pulmonary artery myocytes. In addition, it is the most effective inhibitor of Kv4.2 channels described thus far, with an IC50 of 1.2 nM. HmTx toxins share sequence similarities with both the potassium channel blocker toxins (HmTx1) and the calcium channel blocker toxin omega-GsTx SIA (HmTx2). They inhibit potassium current associated with Kv2 subtypes in the 100 to 300 nM concentration range. HmTx2 seems to be a specific inhibitor of Kv2 channels, whereas HmTx1 also inhibits Kv4 channels, including Kv4.1, with the same potency. HmTx1 is the first\nrole of MiRP1 in regulating hERG (and therefore ventricular I(Kr)) in vivo. Some ancillary subunits may exhibit varied expression to shape spatial Kv current variation, for example, KChIP2 and the epicardial-endocardial I(to) current density gradient. Indeed, it is likely that most native ventricular Kv channels exhibit temporal and spatial heterogeneity of subunit composition, complicating both modeling of their functional impact on the ventricular action potential and design of specific current-targeted compounds. Here, we discuss current thinking and lines of experimentation aimed at resolving the complexities of the Kv channel complexes that repolarize the human ventricular myocardium. V374A KCND3 Pathogenic Variant Associated With Paroxysmal Ataxia Exacerbations. OBJECTIVE: Ataxia channelopathies share common features such as slow motor progression and variable degrees of cognitive dysfunction. Mutations in potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily D member 3 (KCND3), encoding the K+ channel, Kv4.3, are associated with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 19, allelic with SCA22. Mutations in potassium\nsubunits, we tested whether a region of the Kv2.2 subunit regulated functional expression in mature neurons. We focused on the large cytoplasmic carboxy tail, a region that differs most between Kv2.2 and the structurally related Kv2.1 subunit. Chimeric Kv2 subunits were generated in which different regions of the large cytoplasmic carboxyl tail were exchanged between Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 subunits. All chimeric Kv2 subunits induced voltage-gated potassium currents when expressed heterologously in oocytes. In vivo chimeric subunits increased IKv density in young neurons on overexpression in the developing embryo. In contrast, in mature neurons, only those chimeras lacking a domain in the proximal carboxy terminus, proxC, increased IKv density when overexpressed. Thus the proxC domain mediates developmental and subunit-specific regulation of IKv and identifies a novel function for protein domains. High spatial density is associated with non-conducting Kv channels from two families. Ion channels are well known for their ability to",

        "desc": "Functional interaction between trace amine-associated receptor 1 and dopamine D2 receptor. The ability of dopamine receptors to interact with other receptor subtypes may provide mechanisms for modulating dopamine-related functions and behaviors. In particular, there is evidence suggesting that the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) affects the dopaminergic system by regulating the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons or by altering dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) responsiveness to ligands. TAAR1 is a G\u03b1(s) protein-coupled receptor that is activated by biogenic amines, \"trace amines,\" such as \u03b2-phenylethylamine (\u03b2-PEA) and tyramine that are normally found at low concentrations in the mammalian brain. In the present study, we investigated the biochemical mechanism of interaction between TAAR1 and D2R and the role this interaction plays in D2R-related signaling and behaviors. Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer biosensor for cAMP, we demonstrated that the D2R antagonists haloperidol, raclopride, and amisulpride were able to enhance selectively a TAAR1-mediated \u03b2-PEA\nspecies-specific differences between human and mouse TAAR1. Our study provides insights into the mechanism of ligand recognition and G-protein selectivity by TAAR1, which may help in the discovery of ligands or therapeutic strategies for neurological and metabolic disorders. Trace Amines and the Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1: Pharmacology, Neurochemistry, and Clinical Implications. Biogenic amines are a collection of endogenous molecules that play pivotal roles as neurotransmitters and hormones. In addition to the \"classical\" biogenic amines resulting from decarboxylation of aromatic acids, including dopamine (DA), norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin (5-HT), and histamine, other biogenic amines, present at much lower concentrations in the central nervous system (CNS), and hence referred to as \"trace\" amines (TAs), are now recognized to play significant neurophysiological and behavioral functions. At the turn of the century, the discovery of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a phylogenetically conserved G protein-coupled receptor that is responsive to both TAs, such as\ndysregulation, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, mood disorders, and addiction. Indeed, the recent development of novel pharmacological tools targeting TAAR1 has uncovered the remarkable potential of TAAR1-based medications as new generation pharmacotherapies in neuropsychiatry. This review summarizes recent developments in the study of TAs and TAAR1, their intricate neurochemistry and pharmacology, and their relevance for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease. Recognition of methamphetamine and other amines by trace amine receptor TAAR1. Trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), the founding member of a nine-member family of trace amine receptors, is responsible for recognizing a range of biogenic amines in the brain, including the endogenous \u03b2-phenylethylamine (\u03b2-PEA)1 as well as methamphetamine2, an abused substance that has posed a severe threat to human health and society3. Given its unique physiological role in the brain, TAAR1 is also an emerging target for a range of neurological disorders including schizophrenia, depression and drug addiction2,4,5. Here we report structures\nfor cAMP, we demonstrated that the D2R antagonists haloperidol, raclopride, and amisulpride were able to enhance selectively a TAAR1-mediated \u03b2-PEA increase of cAMP. Moreover, TAAR1 and D2R were able to form heterodimers when coexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and this direct interaction was disrupted in the presence of haloperidol. In addition, in mice lacking TAAR1, haloperidol-induced striatal c-Fos expression and catalepsy were significantly reduced. Taken together, these data suggest that TAAR1 and D2R have functional and physical interactions that could be critical for the modulation of the dopaminergic system by TAAR1 in vivo. Ligand recognition and G-protein coupling of trace amine receptor TAAR1. Trace-amine-associated receptors (TAARs), a group of biogenic amine receptors, have essential roles in neurological and metabolic homeostasis1. They recognize diverse endogenous trace amines and subsequently activate a range of G-protein-subtype signalling pathways2,3. Notably, TAAR1 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for treating psychiatric disorders4,5.\nthe trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a phylogenetically conserved G protein-coupled receptor that is responsive to both TAs, such as \u03b2-phenylethylamine, octopamine, and tyramine, and structurally-related amphetamines, unveiled mechanisms of action for TAs other than interference with aminergic pathways, laying the foundations for deciphering the functional significance of TAs and its mammalian CNS receptor, TAAR1. Although, its molecular interactions and downstream targets have not been fully elucidated, TAAR1 activation triggers accumulation of intracellular cAMP, modulates PKA and PKC signaling and interferes with the \u03b2-arrestin2-dependent pathway via G protein-independent mechanisms. TAAR1 is uniquely positioned to exert direct control over DA and 5-HT neuronal firing and release, which has profound implications for understanding the pathophysiology of, and therefore designing more efficacious therapeutic interventions for, a range of neuropsychiatric disorders that involve aminergic dysregulation, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, mood disorders, and addiction. Indeed, the recent development of novel pharmacological tools targeting TAAR1 has\nalso an emerging target for a range of neurological disorders including schizophrenia, depression and drug addiction2,4,5. Here we report structures of human TAAR1-G-protein complexes bound to methamphetamine and \u03b2-PEA as well as complexes bound to RO5256390, a TAAR1-selective agonist, and SEP-363856, a clinical-stage dual agonist for TAAR1 and serotonin receptor 5-HT1AR (refs. 6,7). Together with systematic mutagenesis and functional studies, the structures reveal the molecular basis of methamphetamine recognition and underlying mechanisms of ligand selectivity and polypharmacology between TAAR1 and other monoamine receptors. We identify a lid-like extracellular loop 2 helix/loop structure and a hydrogen-bonding network in the ligand-binding pockets, which may contribute to the ligand recognition in TAAR1. These findings shed light on the ligand recognition mode and activation mechanism for TAAR1 and should guide the development of next-generation therapeutics for drug addiction and various neurological disorders.\nactivate a range of G-protein-subtype signalling pathways2,3. Notably, TAAR1 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for treating psychiatric disorders4,5. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its ability to recognize different ligands remain largely unclear. Here we present nine cryo-electron microscopy structures, with eight showing human and mouse TAAR1 in a complex with an array of ligands, including the endogenous 3-iodothyronamine, two antipsychotic agents, the psychoactive drug amphetamine and two identified catecholamine agonists, and one showing 5-HT1AR in a complex with an antipsychotic agent. These structures reveal a rigid consensus binding motif in TAAR1 that binds to endogenous trace amine stimuli and two extended binding pockets that accommodate diverse chemotypes. Combined with mutational analysis, functional assays and molecular dynamic simulations, we elucidate the structural basis of drug polypharmacology and identify the species-specific differences between human and mouse TAAR1.

To determine whether calnexin interacted physically with the V-ATPase, microsomal membranes were Triton X-100 solubilized, and the protein-protein interaction was analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation. Monoclonal antibodies against calnexin precipitated both calnexin and V-ATPase subunits, including A and B and those of 44, 42, 36, 16, and 13 kD. A monoclonal antibody against subunit A precipitated the entire V-ATPase complex as well as calnexin and BiP, an endoplasmic reticulum lumen chaperone. The results support our hypothesis that both calnexin and BiP act as molecular chaperones in the folding and assembly of newly synthesized V1V0-ATPases at the endoplasmic reticulum. Early vertebrate origin and diversification of small transmembrane regulators of cellular ion transport. KEY POINTS: Small transmembrane proteins such as FXYDs, which interact with Na+ ,K+ -ATPase, and the micropeptides that interact with sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase play\nprotein with a cleavable signal sequence, a single membrane spanning domain, and its C-terminus located in the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) lumen. However, in the present study we show that torsinA is not in fact an integral membrane protein. Instead we find that the mature protein associates peripherally with the ER membrane, most likely through an interaction with an integral membrane protein. Consistent with this model, we provide evidence that the signal peptidase complex cleaves the signal sequence of torsinA, and we show that the region previously suggested to form a transmembrane domain is translocated into the lumen of the ER. The finding that torsinA is a peripheral, and not an integral membrane protein as previously thought, has important implications for understanding the function of this novel ATPase. Selenoprotein N is an endoplasmic reticulum calcium sensor that links luminal calcium levels to a redox activity. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the\nfolding mutants Diverse functions with a common regulator: ubiquitin takes command of an AAA ATPase A membrane protein complex mediates retro-translocation from the ER lumen into the cytosol EDEM as an acceptor of terminally misfolded glycoproteins released from calnexin Inaugural Article: Recruitment of the p97 ATPase and ubiquitin ligases to the site of retrotranslocation at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane Valosin-containing protein (p97) is a regulator of endoplasmic reticulum stress and of the degradation of N-end rule and ubiquitin-fusion degradation pathway substrates in mammalian cells Murine polyomavirus requires the endoplasmic reticulum protein Derlin-2 to initiate infection Bap31 is an itinerant protein that moves between the peripheral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and a juxtanuclear compartment related to ER-associated Degradation Gangliosides that associate with lipid rafts mediate transport of cholera and related toxins from the plasma membrane to endoplasmic reticulum Activation of the Unfolded Protein Response by F508 CFTR The unfolded protein response: a\nthe plasma membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondria seems to be essential for numerous cellular processes involved in Ca(2+) signalling and maintenance of Ca(2+) homeostasis. A presence of microsomal and mitochondrial proteins together with those characteristic for the plasma membrane in the fraction of the plasma membrane associated membranes (PAM) indicates a formation of stabile interactions between these three structures. We isolated the plasma membrane associated membranes from Jurkat cells and found its significant enrichment in the plasma membrane markers including plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase, Na(+), K(+)-ATPase and CD3 as well as sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase as a marker of the endoplasmic reticulum membranes. In addition, two proteins involved in the store-operated Ca(2+) entry, Orai1 located in the plasma membrane and an endoplasmic reticulum protein STIM1 were found in this fraction. Furthermore, we observed a rearrangement of STIM1-containing protein complexes isolated from Jurkat cells undergoing stimulation by thapsigargin. We suggest\nand skeletal muscles, respectively. Myoregulin (MLN), dwarf open reading frame (DWORF), endoregulin (ELN), and another-regulin (ALN) are newly discovered tissue-specific regulators of SERCA. Herein, we compare the functional properties of the regulin family of SERCA transmembrane peptide subunits and consider their regulatory mechanisms in the context of the physiological and pathophysiological roles of these peptides. We present new functional data for human MLN, ELN, and ALN, demonstrating that they are inhibitors of SERCA with distinct functional consequences. Molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations of SERCA in complex with the transmembrane domains of MLN and ALN provide insights into how differential binding to the so-called inhibitory groove of SERCA-formed by transmembrane helices M2, M6, and M9-can result in distinct functional outcomes. A Cdc48p-associated factor modulates endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, cell stress, and ubiquitinated protein homeostasis. The hexameric AAA-ATPase, Cdc48p, catalyzes an array of cellular activities, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD), ER/Golgi\nfraction. Furthermore, we observed a rearrangement of STIM1-containing protein complexes isolated from Jurkat cells undergoing stimulation by thapsigargin. We suggest that the inter-membrane compartment composed of the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum, and isolated as a stabile plasma membrane associated membranes fraction, might be involved in the store-operated Ca(2+) entry, and their formation and rebuilding have an important regulatory role in cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis. The molecular chaperone calnexin associates with the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase from oat seedlings. Acidification of endomembrane compartments by the vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) is central to many cellular processes in eukaryotes, including osmoregulation and protein sorting. The V-ATPase complex consists of a peripheral sector (V1) and a membrane integral sector (V0); however, it is unclear how the multimeric enzyme is assembled. A 64-kD polypeptide that had copurified with oat V-ATPase subunits has been identified as calnexin, an integral protein on the endoplasmic reticulum. To determine whether calnexin\nan endoplasmic reticulum calcium sensor that links luminal calcium levels to a redox activity. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the reservoir for calcium in cells. Luminal calcium levels are determined by calcium-sensing proteins that trigger calcium dynamics in response to calcium fluctuations. Here we report that Selenoprotein N (SEPN1) is a type II transmembrane protein that senses ER calcium fluctuations by binding this ion through a luminal EF-hand domain. In vitro and in vivo experiments show that via this domain, SEPN1 responds to diminished luminal calcium levels, dynamically changing its oligomeric state and enhancing its redox-dependent interaction with cellular partners, including the ER calcium pump sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA). Importantly, single amino acid substitutions in the EF-hand domain of SEPN1 identified as clinical variations are shown to impair its calcium-binding and calcium-dependent structural changes, suggesting a key role of the EF-hand domain in SEPN1 function. In conclusion, SEPN1 is\nproperties of alphaNK.betaNK, alphaNK.betaHK, or alphaNK. betaNK/betaHK complexes shows that the effect of the betaNK on K+ binding is mainly mediated by its ectodomain. Finally, betaHK/NK containing the transmembrane domain of betaHK produces stable but endoplasmic reticulum-retained alphaNK.beta complexes, while alphaNK/betaHK complexes can leave the ER but exhibit reduced ouabain binding capacity and transport function. Thus, interactions of both the transmembrane and the ectodomain of betaNK with alphaNK are necessary to form correctly folded Na,K-ATPase complexes that can be targeted to the plasma membrane and/or become functionally competent. Furthermore, the beta N terminus plays a role in the beta-subunit's folding necessary for correct interactions with the alpha-subunit. Plasma membrane associated membranes (PAM) from Jurkat cells contain STIM1 protein is PAM involved in the capacitative calcium entry? A proper cooperation between the plasma membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondria seems to be essential for numerous cellular processes involved in Ca(2+)\nrole in Cdc48p substrate release, ydr049 mutant cells accumulate Cdc48p-bound ubiquitinated proteins at the ER membrane. Moreover, YDR049 interacts with genes encoding select UBX (ubiquitin regulatory X) and UFD (ubiquitin fusion degradation) proteins, which are Cdc48p partners. Exacerbated growth defects are apparent in some of the mutant combinations, and synergistic effects on the degradation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and CPY*, which is a soluble ERAD substrate, are evident in specific ydr049-ufd and -ubx mutants. These data suggest that Ydr049p acts in parallel with Cdc48p partners to modulate ERAD and other cellular activities. Transmembrane helix 11 is a genuine regulator of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump and acts as a functional parallel of \u03b2-subunit on \u03b1-Na+,K+-ATPase. The housekeeping sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase SERCA2b transports Ca(2+) across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane maintaining a vital Ca(2+) gradient. Compared with the muscle-specific isoforms SERCA2a and SERCA1a, SERCA2b houses an 11th transmembrane segment\nTurnbull et al.; Hebert et al.). The SarcoEndoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase. The calcium pump (a.k.a. Ca2+-ATPase or SERCA) is a membrane transport protein ubiquitously found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of all eukaryotic cells. As a calcium transporter, SERCA maintains the low cytosolic calcium level that enables a vast array of signaling pathways and physiological processes (e.g. synaptic transmission, muscle contraction, fertilization). In muscle cells, SERCA promotes relaxation by pumping calcium ions from the cytosol into the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), the main storage compartment for intracellular calcium. X-ray crystallographic studies have provided an extensive understanding of the intermediate states that SERCA populates as it progresses through the calcium transport cycle. Historically, SERCA is also known to be regulated by small transmembrane peptides, phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN). PLN is expressed in cardiac muscle, whereas SLN predominates in skeletal and atrial muscle. These two regulatory subunits play critical\nfibrosis transmembrane regulator gene (CFTR), inhibition of CFTR function pharmacologically (CFTR(inh)172), or stable expression of antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit CFTR expression caused decreased SERCA2 expression. In CF cells, SERCA2 interacted with Bcl-2, leading to its displacement from caveolae-related domains of endoplasmic reticulum membranes, as demonstrated in sucrose density gradient centrifugation and immunoprecipitation studies. Knockdown of SERCA2 using siRNA enhanced epithelial cell death due to ozone, hydrogen peroxide, and TNF-alpha.CONCLUSIONS: Reduced SERCA2 expression may alter calcium signaling and apoptosis in CF. These findings decrease the likelihood of therapeutic benefit of SERCA inhibition in CF. TorsinA participates in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation TorsinA is an AAA+ ATPase located within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope, with a mutant form causing early onset torsion dystonia (DYT1). Here we report a new function for torsinA in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). Retro-translocation and proteosomal degradation of a mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator\nphylogenetic analysis further indicates that TM11 is the oldest and most conserved feature of the 2b-tail, found in the SERCA pump of all Bilateria, whereas LE is only present in Nematoda and vertebrates. Considering remarkable similarities with the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase \u03b1-\u03b2 interaction, we now propose a model for interaction of TM11 with TM7 and TM10 in the anchoring subdomain of the Ca(2+) pump. This model involves a TM11-induced helix bending of TM7. In conclusion, more than just a passive structural feature, TM11 acts as a genuine regulator of Ca(2+) transport through interaction with the pump. Biosynthesis of the dystonia-associated AAA+ ATPase torsinA at the endoplasmic reticulum. TorsinA is a widely expressed AAA(+) (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) ATPase of unknown function. Previous studies have described torsinA as a type II protein with a cleavable signal sequence, a single membrane spanning domain, and its C-terminus located in the ER (endoplasmic reticulum)\nthe plasma membrane to endoplasmic reticulum Activation of the Unfolded Protein Response by F508 CFTR The unfolded protein response: a stress signaling pathway critical for health and disease A highly sensitive assay for monitoring the secretory pathway and ER stress Involvement of endoplasmic reticulum stress on the cell death induced by 6-hydroxydopamine in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells Endoplasmic reticulum stress in health and disease A close association of torsinA and alpha-synuclein in Lewy bodies: a fluorescence resonance energy transfer study TorsinA immunoreactivity in inclusion bodies in trinucleotide repeat diseases Inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia is caused by mutant valosin-containing protein ALS-linked mutant SOD1 induces ER stress- and ASK1-dependent motor neuron death by targeting Derlin-1 The early-onset torsion dystonia associated protein, torsinA, is a homeostatic regulator of endoplasmic reticulum stress response LULL1 retargets TorsinA to the nuclear envelope revealing an activity that is impaired\nubiquitinated protein homeostasis. The hexameric AAA-ATPase, Cdc48p, catalyzes an array of cellular activities, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD), ER/Golgi membrane dynamics, and DNA replication. Accumulating data suggest that unique Cdc48p partners, such as Npl4p-Ufd1p and Ubx1p/Shp1p (p47 in vertebrates), target Cdc48p for these diverse functions. Other Cdc48p-associated proteins have been identified, but the interplay among these factors and their activities is largely cryptic. We now report on a previously uncharacterized Cdc48p-associated protein, Ydr049p, also known as Vms1p, which binds Cdc48p at both the ER membrane and in the cytosol under non-stressed conditions. Loss of YDR049 modestly slows the degradation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator but does not impede substrate ubiquitination, suggesting that Ydr049p acts at a postubiquitination step in the ERAD pathway. Consistent with Ydr049p playing a role in Cdc48p substrate release, ydr049 mutant cells accumulate Cdc48p-bound ubiquitinated proteins at the ER membrane. Moreover, YDR049 interacts with\nof SERCA structure, function, and regulation. Nothing Regular about the Regulins: Distinct Functional Properties of SERCA Transmembrane Peptide Regulatory Subunits. The sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) is responsible for maintaining calcium homeostasis in all eukaryotic cells by actively transporting calcium from the cytosol into the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) lumen. Calcium is an important signaling ion, and the activity of SERCA is critical for a variety of cellular processes such as muscle contraction, neuronal activity, and energy metabolism. SERCA is regulated by several small transmembrane peptide subunits that are collectively known as the \"regulins\". Phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN) are the original and most extensively studied members of the regulin family. PLN and SLN inhibit the calcium transport properties of SERCA and they are required for the proper functioning of cardiac and skeletal muscles, respectively. Myoregulin (MLN), dwarf open reading frame (DWORF), endoregulin (ELN), and another-regulin (ALN) are newly discovered tissue-specific\nAAA+ proteins: have engine, will work AAA+ superfamily ATPases: common structure--diverse function Walker-A threonine couples nucleotide occupancy with the chaperone activity of the AAA+ ATPase ClpB TorsinA and its torsion dystonia-associated mutant forms are lumenal glycoproteins that exhibit distinct subcellular localizations Biosynthesis of the dystonia-associated AAA+ ATPase torsinA at the endoplasmic reticulum TorsinA in PC12 cells: localization in the endoplasmic reticulum and response to stress Loss of the dystonia-associated protein torsinA selectively disrupts the neuronal nuclear envelope TorsinA: movement at many levels TorsinA participates in linkage between nuclear envelope and cytoskeleton TorsinA in the nuclear envelope A molecular mechanism underlying the neural-specific defect in torsinA mutant mice Effect of torsinA on membrane proteins reveals a loss of function and a dominant-negative phenotype of the dystonia-associated DeltaE-torsinA mutant Torsin-mediated protection from cellular stress in the dopaminergic neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans siRNA knock-down of mutant torsinA restores processing through secretory pathway in\nsuch as FXYDs, which interact with Na+ ,K+ -ATPase, and the micropeptides that interact with sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase play fundamental roles in regulation of ion transport in vertebrates. Uncertain evolutionary origins and phylogenetic relationships among these regulators of ion transport have led to inconsistencies in their classification across vertebrate species, thus hampering comparative studies of their functions. We discovered the first FXYD homologue in sea lamprey, a basal jawless vertebrate, which suggests small transmembrane regulators of ion transport emerged early in the vertebrate lineage. We also identified 13 gene subfamilies of FXYDs and propose a revised, phylogeny-based FXYD classification that is consistent across vertebrate species. These findings provide an improved framework for investigating physiological and pathophysiological functions of small transmembrane regulators of ion transport.ABSTRACT: Small transmembrane proteins are important for regulation of cellular ion transport. The most prominent among these are members of the FXYD family (FXYD1-12), which regulate\nfunction for torsinA in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). Retro-translocation and proteosomal degradation of a mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR\u0394F508) was inhibited by downregulation of torsinA or overexpression of mutant torsinA, and facilitated by increased torsinA. Retro-translocation of cholera toxin was also decreased by downregulation of torsinA. TorsinA associates with proteins implicated in ERAD, including Derlin-1, VIMP, and p97. Further, torsinA reduces endoplasmic reticulum stress in nematodes overexpressing CFTR\u0394F508, and fibroblasts from DYT1 dystonia patients are more sensitive than controls to endoplasmic reticulum stress and less able to degrade mutant CFTR. Therefore, compromised ERAD function in the cells of DYT1 patients may increase sensitivity to endoplasmic reticulum stress with consequent alterations in neuronal function contributing to the disease state. Introduction Most cases of the dominantly inherited human movement disorder, early onset torsion dystonia (DYT1), are caused by a 3 bp deletion (GAG), resulting in loss of a glutamic acid\nearly onset torsion dystonia (DYT1), are caused by a 3 bp deletion (GAG), resulting in loss of a glutamic acid (\u0394E302 or 303) in the carboxy terminal region of torsinA. TorsinA is a member of the AAA+ ATPase superfamily of proteins, which have a variety of cellular locations and functions, and has some homology to the bacterial chaperone protein, ClpB. TorsinA is located predominantly in the contiguous lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope (NE), and thought to be retained there by association with membrane spanning proteins. The \u0394E deletion is thought to cause loss-of-function and to suppress wild-type torsinA activity. Recent studies have implicated torsinA in interactions between proteins in the outer membrane of the NE and the cytoskeleton involved in nuclear polarization, and in the inner and outer NE membranes contributing to NE morphology, as well as participating in processing of proteins through the ER component\nDiversification of SERCA regulators was much less extensive, indicating they operate under different evolutionary constraints. Finally, we found that FXYDs in extant vertebrates can be classified into 13 gene subfamilies, which do not always correspond to the established FXYD classification. We therefore propose a revised classification that is based on evolutionary history of FXYDs and that is consistent across vertebrate species. Collectively, our findings provide an improved framework for investigating the function of ion transport in health and disease.

RATIONALE: Modulation of the activity of sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) can profoundly affect Ca(2+) homeostasis.

Our findings demonstrate that both PGL-2 and PGL-3 are components of P granules, both interact with PGL-1, and at least PGL-3 functions redundantly with PGL-1 to ensure fertility in both sexes of C. elegans. Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase::6-Phosphogluconolactonase from the Parasite Giardia lamblia. A Molecular and Biochemical Perspective of a Fused Enzyme. Giardia lamblia is a single-celled eukaryotic parasite with a small genome and is considered an early divergent eukaryote. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) plays an essential role in the oxidative stress defense of the parasite and the production of ribose-5-phosphate. In this parasite, the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is fused with the 6-phosphogluconolactonase (6PGL) enzyme, generating the enzyme named G6PD::6PGL that catalyzes the first two steps of the PPP. Here, we report that the G6PD::6PGL is a bifunctional enzyme with two catalytically\nas 6-phosphogluconolactonase (6PGL) activity. Using co-immunoprecipitation experiments with purified H6PDH and 11beta-HSD1, and with cell lysates expressing H6PDH and 11beta-HSD1, we observe direct physical interaction between the two enzymes. We also show the modulation of 11beta-HSD1 directionality by H6PDH using overexpression and siRNA knockdown systems. The NTD retains the ability to interact with 11beta-HSD1 physically as well as modulate 11beta-HSD1 directionality indicating that the NTD of H6PDH is sufficient for the regulation of the 11beta-HSD1 activity. The PGL family proteins associate with germ granules and function redundantly in Caenorhabditis elegans germline development. PGL-1 is a constitutive protein component of C. elegans germ granules, also known as P granules. Maternally supplied PGL-1 is essential for germline development but only at elevated temperature, raising the possibility that redundant factors provide sufficient function at lower temperatures. We have identified two PGL-1-related proteins, PGL-2 and PGL-3, by sequence analysis of the C. elegans genome\nof 6-phosphogluconolactonase (6PGL) from T. brucei, the second enzyme from PPP, was determined at 2.1 Angstroms resolution. Comparison of its sequence and structure to other related proteins in the 6PGL family with a known structure (Thermotoga maritima Tm6GPL 1PBT and Vibrio cholerae Vc6PGL (1Y89), which have not been discussed in print), or in the glucosamine-6-phosphate-deaminase family (hexameric Escherichia coli 1DEA and monomeric Bacillus subtilis 2BKV), allowed the identification of the 6PGL active site. In addition to the analysis of the crystal structure, 3D NMR interaction studies and docking experiments are reported here. Key residues involved in substrate binding or in catalysis were identified.\nthese enzymes play in the metabolism of cells, and their susceptibility to oxidation and inactivation with special emphasis on NADPH production. Perspectives on achieving a better understanding of the molecular basis of the oxidation these enzymes within cellular environments are given. Three dimensional structure and implications for the catalytic mechanism of 6-phosphogluconolactonase from Trypanosoma brucei. Enzymes from the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) are potential drug targets for the development of new drugs against Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping disease: for instance, the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase is currently studied actively for such purposes. Structural and functional studies are necessary to better characterize the associated enzymes and compare them to their human homologues, in order to undertake structure-based drug design studies on such targets. In this context, the crystal structure of 6-phosphogluconolactonase (6PGL) from T. brucei, the second enzyme from PPP, was determined at 2.1 Angstroms resolution. Comparison of its\nat lower temperatures. We have identified two PGL-1-related proteins, PGL-2 and PGL-3, by sequence analysis of the C. elegans genome and by a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with PGL-1. PGL-3 is associated with P granules at all stages of development, while PGL-2 is associated with P granules only during postembryonic development. All three PGL proteins interact with each other in vitro. Furthermore, PGL-1 and PGL-3 are co-immunoprecipitated from embryo extracts, indicating that they are indeed in the same protein complex in vivo. Nevertheless, each PGL protein localizes to P granules independently of the other two. pgl-2 or pgl-3 single-mutant worms do not show obvious defects in germline development. However, pgl-1; pgl-3 (but not pgl-2; pgl-1) double-mutant hermaphrodites and males show significantly enhanced sterility at all temperatures, compared to pgl-1 alone. Mutant hermaphrodites show defects in germline proliferation and in production of healthy gametes and viable embryos. Our\nlamblia fused enzyme G6PD::6PGL with the human G6PD indicate that the G6PD::6PGL is a potential drug target for the rational synthesis of novels anti-Giardia drugs. Biochemical Characterization and Structural Modeling of Fused Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase-Phosphogluconolactonase from Giardia lamblia. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the first enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway and is highly relevant in the metabolism of Giardialamblia. Previous reports suggested that the G6PD gene is fused with the 6-phosphogluconolactonase (6PGL) gene (6pgl). Therefore, in this work, we decided to characterize the fused G6PD-6PGL protein in Giardialamblia. First, the gene of g6pd fused with the 6pgl gene (6gpd::6pgl) was isolated from trophozoites of Giardialamblia and the corresponding G6PD::6PGL protein was overexpressed and purified in Escherichia coli. Then, we characterized the native oligomeric state of the G6PD::6PGL protein in solution and we found a catalytic dimer with an optimum pH of 8.75. Furthermore, we determined the steady-state kinetic parameters for the\nMolecular explorations of the Leishmania donovani 6-phosphogluconolactonase enzyme, a key player in the pentose phosphate pathway. The enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway are vital to survival in kinetoplastids. The second step of the pentose phosphate pathway involves hydrolytic cleavage of 6-phosphogluconolactone to 6-phosphogluconic acid by 6- phosphogluconolactonase (6PGL). In the present study, Leishmania donovani 6PGL (Ld6PGL) was cloned and overexpressed in bacterial expression system. Comparative sequence analysis revealed the conserved sequence motifs, functionally and structurally important residues in 6PGL family. In silico amino acid substitution study and interacting partners of 6PGL were predicted. The Ld6PGL enzyme was found to be active in the assay and in the parasites. Specificity was confirmed by Western blot analysis. The \u223c30 kDa protein was found to be a dimer in MALDI, glutaraldehyde crosslinking and size exclusion chromatography studies. Kinetic analysis and structural stability studies of Ld6PGL were performed with denaturants and at varied\ncritical for maintaining its stability and further activation of PPP. Targeting ISGylated YAP might be a new choice for hyperglycemia cancer treatment. Peroxyl radicals modify 6-phosphogluconolactonase from Escherichia coli via oxidation of specific amino acids and aggregation which inhibits enzyme activity. 6-phosphogluconolactonase (6PGL) catalyzes the second reaction of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) converting 6-phosphogluconolactone to 6-phosphogluconate. The PPP is critical to the generation of NADPH and metabolic intermediates, but some of its components are susceptible to oxidative inactivation. Previous studies have characterized damage to the first (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) and third (6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) enzymes of the pathway, but no data are available for 6PGL. This knowledge gap is addressed here. Oxidation of Escherichia coli 6PGL by peroxyl radicals (ROO\u2022, from AAPH (2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride) was examined using SDS-PAGE, amino acid consumption, liquid chromatography with mass detection (LC-MS), protein carbonyl formation and computational methods. NADPH generation was assessed using mixtures all three\nsite and the catalytic dyad (His130 and Arg179). Together these data indicate that monomeric 6PGL is a robust enzyme towards oxidative inactivation by ROO\u2022 and when compared to other PPP enzymes. The enzymes of the oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway as targets of reactive species: consequences for NADPH production. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is a key metabolic pathway. The oxidative phase of this process involves three reactions catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), 6-phosphogluconolactonase (6PGL) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH) enzymes. The first and third steps (catalyzed by G6PDH and 6PGDH, respectively) are responsible for generating reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAPDH), a key cofactor for maintaining the reducing power of cells and detoxification of both endogenous and exogenous oxidants and electrophiles. Despite the importance of these enzymes, little attention has been paid to the fact that these proteins are targets of oxidants. In response to oxidative stimuli metabolic\nthe first two steps of the PPP. Here, we report that the G6PD::6PGL is a bifunctional enzyme with two catalytically active sites. We performed the kinetic characterization of both domains in the fused G6PD::6PGL enzyme, as well as the individual cloned G6PD. The results suggest that the catalytic activity of G6PD and 6PGL domains in the G6PD::6PGL enzyme are more efficient than the individual proteins. Additionally, using enzymatic and mass spectrometry assays, we found that the final metabolites of the catalytic reaction of the G6PD::6PGL are 6-phosphoglucono-\u03b4-lactone and 6-phosphogluconate. Finally, we propose the reaction mechanism in which the G6PD domain performs the catalysis, releasing 6-phosphoglucono-\u03b4-lactone to the reaction medium. Then, this metabolite binds to the 6PGL domain catalyzing the hydrolysis reaction and generating 6-phosphogluconate. The structural difference between the G. lamblia fused enzyme G6PD::6PGL with the human G6PD indicate that the G6PD::6PGL is a potential drug target for the rational\nubiquitin-protein ligase (\u03b2TrCP) to promote YAP stability. However, ISGylation-induced pro-YAP effects were abolished by YAP K497R (K, lysine; R, arginine) mutation, suggesting K497 could be the major YAP ISGylation site. In addition, YAP ISGylation promoted cell viability, cell-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumor formation. YAP ISGylation also increased downstream genes transcription, including one of the key enzymes of PPP, 6-phosphogluconolactonase (6PGL). Mechanistically, YAP promoted 6PGL transcription by simultaneously recruiting SMAD family member 2 (SMAD2) and TEA domain transcription factor 4 (TEAD4) binding to the 6PGL promoter to activate PPP. In clinical lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) specimens, we found that YAP ISGylation degree was positively associated with 6PGL mRNA level, especially in high glucose LUAD tissues compared to low glucose LUAD tissues. Collectively, this study suggested that YAP ISGylation is critical for maintaining its stability and further activation of PPP. Targeting ISGylated YAP might be a new choice for hyperglycemia\nin combating oxidative stress in Leishmania. H6PDH interacts directly with 11beta-HSD1: implications for determining the directionality of glucocorticoid catalysis. Tissue specific amplification of glucocorticoid action through NADPH-dependent reduction of inactive glucocorticoid precursors by 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11beta-HSD1) contributes to the development of visceral obesity, insulin resistance and Type 2 Diabetes. Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH) is believed to supply NADPH for the reductase activity of 11beta-HSD1 in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the two enzymes are co-localized. We report here expression and purification of full-length and truncated N-terminal domain (NTD) of H6PDH in a mammalian expression system. Interestingly, both full-length H6PDH and the truncated NTD are secreted into the culture medium in the absence of 11beta-HSD1. Purified full-length H6PDH is a bi-functional enzyme with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity as well as 6-phosphogluconolactonase (6PGL) activity. Using co-immunoprecipitation experiments with purified H6PDH and 11beta-HSD1, and with cell lysates expressing H6PDH and 11beta-HSD1,\nliquid chromatography with mass detection (LC-MS), protein carbonyl formation and computational methods. NADPH generation was assessed using mixtures all three enzymes of the oxidative phase of the PPP. Incubation of 6PGL with 10 or 100 mM AAPH resulted in protein aggregation mostly due to reducible (disulfide) bonds. High fluxes of ROO\u2022 induced consumption of Cys, Met and Trp, with the Cys oxidation rationalizing the aggregate formation. Low levels of carbonyls were detected, while LC-MS analyses provided evidence for oxidation of selected Trp and Met residues (Met1, Trp18, Met41, Trp203, Met220 and Met221). ROO\u2022 elicited little loss of enzymatic activity of monomeric 6PGL, but the aggregates showed diminished NADPH generation. This is consistent with in silico analyses that indicate that the modified Trp and Met are far from the 6-phosphogluconolactone binding site and the catalytic dyad (His130 and Arg179). Together these data indicate that monomeric 6PGL is a robust enzyme towards\nand size exclusion chromatography studies. Kinetic analysis and structural stability studies of Ld6PGL were performed with denaturants and at varied temperature. Computational 3D Structural modelling of Ld6PGL elucidates that it has a similar \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase fold structural topology as in other members of 6PGL family. The three loops are found in extended form when the structure is compared with the human 6PGL (Hs6PGL). Further, enzyme substrate binding mode and its mechanism were investigated using the molecular docking and molecular simulation studies. Interesting dynamics action of substrate 6-phosphogluconolactone was observed into active site during MD simulation. Interesting differences were observed between host and parasite enzyme which pointed towards its potential to be explored as an antileishmanial drug target. This study forms the basis for further analysis of the role of Ld6PGL in combating oxidative stress in Leishmania. H6PDH interacts directly with 11beta-HSD1: implications for determining the directionality of glucocorticoid catalysis. Tissue\nwe found a catalytic dimer with an optimum pH of 8.75. Furthermore, we determined the steady-state kinetic parameters for the G6PD domain and measured the thermal stability of the protein in both the presence and absence of guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) and observed that the G6PD::6PGL protein showed alterations in the stability, secondary structure, and tertiary structure in the presence of Gdn-HCl. Finally, computer modeling studies revealed unique structural and functional features, which clearly established the differences between G6PD::6PGL protein from G. lamblia and the human G6PD enzyme, proving that the model can be used for the design of new drugs with antigiardiasic activity. These results broaden the perspective for future studies of the function of the protein and its effect on the metabolism of this parasite as a potential pharmacological target. YAP ISGylation increases its stability and promotes its positive regulation on PPP by stimulating 6PGL transcription. Yes-associated protein (YAP)\ntarget. YAP ISGylation increases its stability and promotes its positive regulation on PPP by stimulating 6PGL transcription. Yes-associated protein (YAP) activation is crucial for tumor formation and development, and its stability is regulated by ubiquitination. ISGylation is a type of ubiquitination like post-translational modification, whereas whether YAP is ISGylated and how ISGylation influences YAP ubiquitination-related function remains uncovered. In addition, YAP can activate glucose metabolism by activating the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) and glycolysis, and generate a large number of intermediates to promote tumor proliferation. However, whether YAP stimulates the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), another tumor-promoting glucose metabolism pathway, and the relationship between this stimulation and ISGylation needs further investigation. Here, we found that YAP was ISGylated and this ISGylation inhibited YAP ubiquitination, proteasome degradation, interaction with-beta-transducin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (\u03b2TrCP) to promote YAP stability. However, ISGylation-induced pro-YAP effects were abolished by YAP K497R (K, lysine; R, arginine)\nattention has been paid to the fact that these proteins are targets of oxidants. In response to oxidative stimuli metabolic pathways are modulated, with the PPP often up-regulated in order to enhance or maintain the reductive capacity of cells. Under such circumstances, oxidation and inactivation of the PPP enzymes could be detrimental. Damage to the PPP enzymes may result in a downward spiral, as depending on the extent and sites of modification, these alterations may result in a loss of enzymatic activity and therefore increased oxidative damage due to NADPH depletion. In recent years, it has become evident that the three enzymes of the oxidative phase of the PPP have different susceptibilities to inactivation on exposure to different oxidants. In this review, we discuss existing knowledge on the role that these enzymes play in the metabolism of cells, and their susceptibility to oxidation and inactivation with special emphasis on NADPH",

        "desc": "rectifier K+ channels have an R-x-F-x-V motif. We demonstrate that two of these channels, Kir2.1 and Kir2.3, are activated by OSR1, while Kir4.1, which does not contain the motif, is not sensitive to changes in OSR1 or WNK activity. Mutation of the motif prevents activation of Kir2.3 by OSR1. Both siRNA knockdown of OSR1 and chemical inhibition of WNK activity disrupt NaCl-induced plasma membrane localization of Kir2.3. Our results suggest a mechanism by which WNK-OSR1 enhance Kir2.1 and Kir2.3 channel activity by increasing their plasma membrane localization. Regulation of members of the inward rectifier K+ channel family adds functional and mechanistic insight into the physiological impact of the WNK pathway. Tamoxifen inhibits inward rectifier K+ 2.x family of inward rectifier channels by interfering with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-channel interactions. Tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor antagonist used in the treatment of breast cancer, inhibits the inward rectifier potassium current (I(K1)) in cardiac myocytes by\nreceptor antagonist used in the treatment of breast cancer, inhibits the inward rectifier potassium current (I(K1)) in cardiac myocytes by an unknown mechanism. We characterized the inhibitory effects of tamoxifen on Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3 potassium channels that underlie cardiac I(K1). We also studied the effects of 4-hydroxytamoxifen and raloxifene. All three drugs inhibited inward rectifier K(+) 2.x (Kir2.x) family members. The order of inhibition for all three drugs was Kir2.3 > Kir2.1 approximately Kir2.2. The onset of inhibition of Kir2.x current by these compounds was slow (T(1/2) approximately 6 min) and only partially recovered after washout ( approximately 30%). Kir2.x inhibition was concentration-dependent but voltage-independent. The time course and degree of inhibition was independent of external or internal drug application. We tested the hypothesis that tamoxifen interferes with the interaction between the channel and the membrane-delimited channel activator, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)). Inhibition of Kir2.3 currents was significantly reduced by\nsubunits of the two-transmembrane domain inward rectifier potassium channel family from rat brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, two of these clones (Kir4.1 and Kir2.3) gave rise to inwardly rectifying potassium currents. Two-electrode voltage clamp commands to potentials negative to EK evoked inward potassium-selective currents which rapidly reached a peak amplitude and then relaxed to a steady-state level. Differences in the extent of current relaxation, the degree of rectification, and the voltage-dependent block by external cesium were detected. Two other members of this family (Kir5.1 and Kir3.4) did not produce macroscopic currents, when expressed by themselves, yet both subunits modified the currents when coexpressed with other specific members of the Kir family. Expression of chimeric subunits between Kir4.1 and either Kir5.1 or Kir3.4 suggested that the transmembrane domains determine the specificity of subunit heteropolymerization, while the C-terminal domains contribute to alterations in activation kinetics and rectification.\ntransmembrane domains determine the specificity of subunit heteropolymerization, while the C-terminal domains contribute to alterations in activation kinetics and rectification. Expression of covalently linked subunits demonstrated that the relative subunit positions, as well as stoichiometry, affect heteromeric channel activity. OSR1 regulates a subset of inward rectifier potassium channels via a binding motif variant. The with-no-lysine (K) (WNK) signaling pathway to STE20/SPS1-related proline- and alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress-responsive 1 (OSR1) kinase is an important mediator of cell volume and ion transport. SPAK and OSR1 associate with upstream kinases WNK 1-4, substrates, and other proteins through their C-terminal domains which interact with linear R-F-x-V/I sequence motifs. In this study we find that SPAK and OSR1 also interact with similar affinity with a motif variant, R-x-F-x-V/I. Eight of 16 human inward rectifier K+ channels have an R-x-F-x-V motif. We demonstrate that two of these channels, Kir2.1 and Kir2.3, are activated by\ndominant disorder related to mutations of the potassium channel Kir2.1, is characterized by cardiac arrhythmias, periodic paralysis, and dysmorphic bone structure. The aim of our study was to find out whether heteromerization of Kir2.1 channels with wild-type Kir2.2 and Kir2.3 channels contributes to the phenotype of Andersen's syndrome. The following results show that Kir2.x channels can form functional heteromers: (i) HEK293 cells transfected with Kir2.x-Kir2.y concatemers expressed inwardly rectifying K(+) channels with a conductance of 28-30 pS. (ii) Expression of Kir2.x-Kir2.y concatemers in Xenopus oocytes produced inwardly rectifying, Ba(2+) sensitive currents. (iii) When Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 channels were coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes the IC(50) for Ba(2+) block of the inward rectifier current differed substantially from the value expected for independent expression of homomeric channels. (iv) Coexpression of nonfunctional Kir2.x constructs, in which the GYG region of the pore region was replaced by AAA, with wild-type Kir2.x channels produced both homomeric\nexpress the Ba2+ -sensitive, inwardly rectifying K+ conductance in colonic muscles. This conductance is most probably a result of heterotetramers of Kir2 gene products, with this regulating resting potentials and the excitability of colonic muscles.ABSTRACT: Membrane potentials of gastrointestinal muscles are important because voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in smooth muscle cells (SMC) provide the Ca2+ that triggers contraction. Regulation of membrane potential is complicated because SMC are electrically coupled to interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) and PDGFR\u03b1+ cells. Activation of conductances in any of these cells affects the excitability of the syncytium. We explored the role of inward rectifier K+ conductances in colonic ICC that might contribute to regulation of membrane potential. ICC expressed Kcnj2 (Kir2.1), Kcnj4 (Kir2.3), Kcnj14 (Kir2.4), Kcnj5 (Kir3.4), Kcnj8 (Kir 6.1) and Kcnj11 (Kir6.2). Voltage clamp experiments showed activation of inward current when extracellular K+ ([K+ ]o ) was increased. The current was inwardly rectifying and inhibited\nin which the GYG region of the pore region was replaced by AAA, with wild-type Kir2.x channels produced both homomeric and heteromeric dominant-negative effects. (v) Kir2.1 and Kir2.3 channels could be coimmunoprecipitated in membrane extracts from isolated guinea pig cardiomyocytes. (vi) Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed interaction between the N- and C-terminal intracellular domains of different Kir2.x subunits. Coexpression of Kir2.1 mutants related to Andersen's syndrome with wild-type Kir2.x channels showed a dominant negative effect, the extent of which varied between different mutants. Our results suggest that differential tetramerization of the mutant allele of Kir2.1 with wild-type Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3 channels represents the molecular basis of the extraordinary pleiotropy of Andersen's syndrome. Inward rectifier potassium channels. Cloning, expression and structure-function studies. A PCR-based cloning strategy was used to identify novel subunits of the two-transmembrane domain inward rectifier potassium channel family from rat brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. When expressed in\nmembrane potential, in regulation of the action potential duration, in receptor-dependent inhibition of cellular excitability, and in the secretion and absorption of K+ ions across cell membrane. Recent molecular biological dissection has shown that the DNAs encoding Kir channels constitute a new family of K+ channels whose subunits contain two putative transmembrane domains and a pore-forming region. So far, more than ten cDNAs of Kir channel subunits have been isolated and classified into four subfamilies: 1) IRK subfamily (IRK1-3/Kir1.1-1.3), 2) GIRK subfamily (GIRK1-4/Kir3.1-3.4), 3) ATP-dependent Kir subfamily (ROMK1/Kir1.1, K(AB)-2/Kir4.1), and 4) ATP-sensitive Kir subfamily (uKATP-1/Kir6.1, BIR/Kir6.2). Xenopus oocytes injected with the cRNAs of IRKs elicit classical Kir channel currents. GIRKs, as heteromultimers, compose the G protein-gated Kir (KG) channels, which are regulated by a variety of Gi/Go-coupled inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors such as m2-mus-carinic, serotonergic (5HT1A), GABAB, somatostatin and opioid (mu, delta, kappa) receptors. ROMK1 and KAB-2 are characterized with a\nMolecular and functional characterization of inwardly rectifying K+ currents in murine proximal colon. KEY POINTS: Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) from murine colonic muscles express genes encoding inwardly rectifying K+ channels. Transcripts of Kcnj2 (Kir2.1), Kcnj4 (Kir2.3), Kcnj14 (Kir2.4), Kcnj5 (Kir3.4), Kcnj8 (Kir 6.1) and Kcnj11 (Kir6.2) were found in colonic ICC. A conductance with properties consistent with Kir2 channels was observed in ICC but not in smooth muscle cells (SMC). Despite expression of gene transcripts, G-protein gated K+ channel (Kir3) and KATP (Kir6) currents were not resolved in ICC. KATP is a conductance prominent in SMC. Kir2 antagonist caused depolarization of freshly dispersed ICC and colonic smooth muscles, suggesting that this conductance is active under resting conditions in colonic muscles. The conclusion of the present study is that ICC express the Ba2+ -sensitive, inwardly rectifying K+ conductance in colonic muscles. This conductance is most probably a result of heterotetramers\ninteraction between the channel and the membrane-delimited channel activator, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)). Inhibition of Kir2.3 currents was significantly reduced by a single point mutation of I213L, which enhances Kir2.3 interaction with membrane PIP(2). Pretreatment with PIP(2) significantly decreased the inhibition induced by tamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and raloxifene on Kir2.3 channels. Pretreatment with spermine (100 microM) decreased the inhibitory effect of tamoxifen on Kir2.1, probably by strengthening the channel's interaction with PIP(2). In cat atrial and ventricular myocytes, 3 microM tamoxifen inhibited I(K1), but the effect was greater in the former than the latter. The data strongly suggest that tamoxifen, its metabolite, and the estrogen receptor inhibitor raloxifene inhibit Kir2.x channels indirectly by interfering with the interaction between the channel and PIP(2).\nconductance. This conductance is most probably a result of the expression of multiple Kir2 family paralogues, and the inwardly rectifying conductance contributes to the regulation of resting potentials and excitability of colonic muscles. Multi-ion distributions in the cytoplasmic domain of inward rectifier potassium channels. Inward rectifier potassium (Kir) channels act as cellular diodes, allowing unrestricted flow of potassium (K(+)) into the cell while preventing currents of large magnitude in the outward direction. The rectification mechanism by which this occurs involves a coupling between K(+) and intracellular blockers-magnesium (Mg(2+)) or polyamines-that simultaneously occupy the permeation pathway. In addition to the transmembrane pore, Kirs possess a large cytoplasmic domain (CD) that provides a favorable electronegative environment for cations. Electrophysiological experiments have shown that the CD is a key regulator of both conductance and rectification. In this study, we calculate and compare averaged equilibrium probability densities of K(+) and Cl(-) in open-pore models\nstates inside the IRK pore, interacting with residues E224, D259, and E299. The strong rectifier CD is also capable of sequestering an additional SPM(4+) at the cytoplasmic entrance near a cluster of negative residues D249, D274, E275, and D276. Although understanding the actual mechanism of rectification blockade will require high-resolution structural information of the blocked state, these simulations provide insight into how sequence variation in the CD can affect the multi-ion distributions that underlie the mechanisms of conduction, rectification affinity, and kinetics. Inwardly rectifying potassium channels: their molecular heterogeneity and function. A variety of cells including cardiac myocytes and neuronal cells possess inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) channels through which currents flow more readily in the inward direction than outward. These K+ channels play pivotal roles in maintenance of the resting membrane potential, in regulation of the action potential duration, in receptor-dependent inhibition of cellular excitability, and in the secretion and\nsuch as m2-mus-carinic, serotonergic (5HT1A), GABAB, somatostatin and opioid (mu, delta, kappa) receptors. ROMK1 and KAB-2 are characterized with a Walker type-A ATP-binding motif in their carboxyl termini, and may be involved in K+ transport in renal epithelial and brain glial cells. uKATP-1 and BIR form with sulfonylurea receptors, the so-called ATP-sensitive K+ channels. Thus, it is a feature of the Kir channel family that each subfamily plays a specific physiological functional role. The (Na+)-activated Kir channels identified electrophysiologically in neurons and cardiac myocytes have not yet been cloned. In this review, we overviewed the current understandings of the features of the molecular structures and functions of the four main subfamilies of Kir channels. Heteromerization of Kir2.x potassium channels contributes to the phenotype of Andersen's syndrome. Andersen's syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder related to mutations of the potassium channel Kir2.1, is characterized by cardiac arrhythmias, periodic paralysis, and dysmorphic bone\nand rectification. In this study, we calculate and compare averaged equilibrium probability densities of K(+) and Cl(-) in open-pore models of the CDs of a weak (Kir1.1-ROMK) and a strong (Kir2.1-IRK) rectifier through explicit-solvent molecular-dynamics simulations in ~1 M KCl. The CD of both channels concentrates K(+) ions greater than threefold inside the cytoplasmic pore while IRK shows an additional K(+) accumulation region near the cytoplasmic entrance. Simulations carried out with Mg(2+) or spermine (SPM(4+)) show that these ions interact with pore-lining residues, shielding the surface charge and reducing K(+) in both channels. The results also show that SPM(4+) behaves differently inside these two channels. Although SPM(4+) remains inside the CD of ROMK, it diffuses around the entire volume of the pore. In contrast, this polyatomic cation finds long-lived conformational states inside the IRK pore, interacting with residues E224, D259, and E299. The strong rectifier CD is also capable of\nshowed activation of inward current when extracellular K+ ([K+ ]o ) was increased. The current was inwardly rectifying and inhibited by Ba2+ (10 \u03bcm) and ML-133 (10 \u03bcm). A similar current was not available in SMC. The current activated in ICC by elevated [K+ ]o was not affected by Tertiapin-Q. G\u03b2\u03b3, when dialysed into cells, failed to activate a unique, Tertiapin-Q-sensitive conductance. Freshly dispersed ICC showed no evidence of functional KATP . Pinacidil failed to activate current and the inward current activated by elevated [K+ ]o was insensitive to glibenclamide. Under current clamp, ML-133 caused the depolarization of isolated ICC and also that of cells impaled with microelectrodes in intact muscle strips. These findings show that ICC, when isolated freshly from colonic muscles, expressed a Ba2+ -sensitive, inwardly rectifying K+ conductance. This conductance is most probably a result of the expression of multiple Kir2 family paralogues, and the inwardly rectifying",

        "desc": "C553S or C558S mutants completely lose channel activity induced by lanthanides or receptor stimulation. Co-expression of TRPC5 (WT) with mutants demonstrated a dominant-negative function in mutants, which inhibited the activity of TRPC5 (WT). We generated TRPC5-TRPC5 dimers and observed reduced activity of WT-mutant (C553S or C558S) dimers compared to WT-WT dimers. When pretreated with reducing agents for 12 h, the TRPC5 current decreased due to a reduction in membrane TRPC5 distribution. In addition, we identified a reduced expression of C553S mutant in plasma membrane. We analyzed a dimeric interaction of wild-type and mutant TRPC5 using co-immunoprecipitation and FRET method, indicating a weak interaction between dimeric partners. These results indicated that the disulfide bond between conserved extracellular cysteines, especially C553, is essential for functional TRPC5 activity by channel multimerization and trafficking. Canonical transient receptor potential 5. Canonical transient receptor potential 5 TRPC5 (also TrpC5, trp-5 or trp5) is one of the\nCanonical transient receptor potential 5. Canonical transient receptor potential 5 TRPC5 (also TrpC5, trp-5 or trp5) is one of the seven mammalian TRPC proteins. Its known functional property is that of a mixed cationic plasma membrane channel with calcium permeability. It is active alone or as a heteromultimeric assembly with TRPC1; TRPC4 and TRPC3 may also be involved. Multiple activators of TRPC5 are emerging, including various G protein-coupled receptor agonists, lysophospholipids, lanthanide ions and, in some contexts, calcium store depletion. Intracellular calcium has complex impact on TRPC5, including a permissive role for other activators, as well as inhibition at high concentrations. Protein kinase C is inhibitory and mediates desensitisation following receptor activation. Tonic TRPC5 activity is detected and may reflect the presence of constitutive activation signals. The channel has voltage dependence but the biological significance of this is unknown; it is partially due to intracellular magnesium blockade at aspartic acid\ndescribed effects of direct channel-phospholipid interaction. Emerging Roles of Diacylglycerol-Sensitive TRPC4/5 Channels. Transient receptor potential classical or canonical 4 (TRPC4) and TRPC5 channels are members of the classical or canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channel family of non-selective cation channels. TRPC4 and TRPC5 channels are widely accepted as receptor-operated cation channels that are activated in a phospholipase C-dependent manner, following the Gq/11 protein-coupled receptor activation. However, their precise activation mechanism has remained largely elusive for a long time, as the TRPC4 and TRPC5 channels were considered as being insensitive to the second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) in contrast to the other TRPC channels. Recent findings indicate that the C-terminal interactions with the scaffolding proteins Na\u207a/H\u207a exchanger regulatory factor 1 and 2 (NHERF1 and NHERF2) dynamically regulate the DAG sensitivity of the TRPC4 and TRPC5 channels. Interestingly, the C-terminal NHERF binding suppresses, while the dissociation of NHERF enables, the DAG sensitivity of\na human aortic cDNA library for novel TRPC4-interacting proteins using a modified yeast two-hybrid assay. This screen identified SESTD1, a previously uncharacterized protein containing a lipid-binding SEC14-like domain as well as spectrin-type cytoskeleton interaction domains. SESTD1 was found to associate with TRPC4 and TRPC5 via the channel's calmodulin- and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-binding domain. In functional studies, we demonstrate that SESTD1 binds several phospholipid species in vitro and is essential for efficient receptor-mediated activation of TRPC5. Notably, phospholipid binding to SESTD1 was Ca(2+)-dependent. Because TRPC4 and -5 conduct Ca(2+), SESTD1-channel signaling may be bidirectional and also couple TRPC activity to lipid signaling through SESTD1. The modulation of TRPC channel function by specific lipid-binding proteins, such as SESTD1, adds another facet to the complex regulation of these channels complementary to the previously described effects of direct channel-phospholipid interaction. Emerging Roles of Diacylglycerol-Sensitive TRPC4/5 Channels. Transient receptor potential classical or canonical 4 (TRPC4)\nthe cell surface to assemble a signaling complex to stimulate neurite outgrowth. Functional Characterization of Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) Channel C5 in Female Murine Gonadotropes. Gonadotrope cells in the anterior pituitary gland secrete gonadotropins regulating gonadal function in mammals. Recent results have implicated transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels in pituitary physiology; however, if and how TRP channels contribute to gonadotrope function is not known. Here, we report that 14 out of 28 TRP channels encoded in the mouse genome are expressed in murine gonadotropes with highest expression levels found for canonical TRP (TRPC) channel 5 in juvenile females. We show that TRP channel expression in these cells exhibits considerable plasticity and that it depends on the sex and the developmental and hormonal status of the animal. We then combine different genetic strategies including genetic confocal Ca2+ imaging in whole-mount pituitary gland preparations to characterize TRPC5 channel function in gonadotropes\nThe TRPC5 activity was detectable with the presence of submillimolar levels of extracellular Ca2+, but it was eliminated by the injection of 5 mM 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid into the oocytes. Lanthanum could substitute for extracellular Ca2+ to support TRPC5 activity. Coexpression of Ca2+-binding protein 1 (CaBP1), but not calmodulin (CaM), inhibited the TRPC5 activity, without affecting the cell surface expression of TRPC5 proteins. Using in vitro binding assays, we demonstrated direction interactions between CaBP1 and TRPC5. The CaBP1-binding sites at the C terminus of TRPC5 are closely localized, but not identical, to CaM-binding sites. We conclude that TRPC5 is a Ca2+-regulated channel, and its activity is negatively controlled by CaBP1. Essential role for TRPC5 in amygdala function and fear-related behavior. The transient receptor potential channel 5 (TRPC5) is predominantly expressed in the brain where it can form heterotetrameric complexes with TRPC1 and TRPC4 channel subunits. These excitatory, nonselective cationic channels are\nheteromultimeric channels. Transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) family contains a non-selective cation channel, and four TRPC subunits form a functional tetrameric channel. TRPC4/5 channels form not only the homotetrameric channel but also a heterotetrameric channel with TRPC1. We investigated the interaction domain required for TRPC1/4 or TRPC1/5 heteromultimeric channels using FRET and the patch-clamp technique. TRPC1 only localized at the plasma membrane (PM) when it was coexpressed with TRPC4 or TRPC5. The TRPC1/4 or TRPC1/5 heteromultimeric showed the typical outward rectifying I/V curve. When TRPC1 and TRPC4 form a heteromeric channel, the N-terminal coiled-coil domain (CCD) and C-terminal 725-745 region of TRPC1 interact with the N-terminal CCD and C-terminal 700-728 region of TRPC4. However, when TRPC1 and TRPC5 form a heteromeric channel, the N-terminal CCD and C-terminal 673-725 region of TRPC1 interact with the N-terminal CCD and C-terminal 707-735 region of TRPC5. In conclusion, the N-terminal CCD of TRPC channels\nTRPC5 is a broadly expressed calcium channel with capability to act as an integrator of extracellular and intracellular signals at the level of calcium entry. Selective G\u03b1i subunits as novel direct activators of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC)4 and TRPC5 channels. The ubiquitous transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels function as non-selective, Ca(2+)-permeable channels and mediate numerous cellular functions. It is commonly assumed that TRPC channels are activated by stimulation of G\u03b1(q)-PLC-coupled receptors. However, whether the G\u03b1(q)-PLC pathway is the main regulator of TRPC4/5 channels and how other G\u03b1 proteins may regulate these channels are poorly understood. We previously reported that TRPC4/TRPC5 can be activated by G\u03b1(i). In the current work, we found that G\u03b1(i) subunits, rather than G\u03b1(q), are the primary and direct activators of TRPC4 and TRPC5. We report a novel molecular mechanism in which TRPC4 is activated by several G\u03b1(i) subunits, most prominently by G\u03b1(i2), and TRPC5\nTRPC5. Human canonical transient receptor potential channel 5 (TRPC5) has been cloned from the Xq23 region on chromosome X as a suspect in nonsyndromic mental retardation. TRPC5 is a Ca(2+)-permeable cation channel predominantly expressed in the CNS, including the hippocampus, cerebellum, amygdala, sensory neurons, and retina. It also shows more restricted expression in the periphery, notably in the kidney and cardiovascular system. Homotetrameric TRPC5 channels are primarily activated by receptors coupled to Gq and phospholipase C and/or Gi proteins, but TRPC5 channels may also gate in a store-dependent manner, which requires other partner proteins such TRPC1, STIM1, and Orai1. There is an impressive array of other activators of TRPC5 channels, such as nitric oxide, lysophospholipids, sphingosine-1-phosphate, reduced thioredoxin, protons, lanthanides, and calcium, and many can cause its direct activation. Moreover, TRPC5 shows constitutive activity, and it is responsive to membrane stretch and cold. Thus, TRPC5 channels have significant potential for\nreport a novel molecular mechanism in which TRPC4 is activated by several G\u03b1(i) subunits, most prominently by G\u03b1(i2), and TRPC5 is activated primarily by G\u03b1(i3). Activation of G\u03b1(i) by the muscarinic M2 receptors or expression of the constitutively active G\u03b1(i) mutants equally and fully activates the channels. Moreover, both TRPC4 and TRPC5 are activated by direct interaction of their conserved C-terminal SESTD (SEC14-like and spectrin-type domains) with the G\u03b1(i) subunits. Two amino acids (lysine 715 and arginine 716) of the TRPC4 C terminus were identified by structural modeling as mediating the interaction with G\u03b1(i2). These findings indicate an essential role of G\u03b1(i) proteins as novel activators for TRPC4/5 and reveal the molecular mechanism by which G-proteins activate the channels. The interaction domains of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC)1/4 and TRPC1/5 heteromultimeric channels. Transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) family contains a non-selective cation channel, and four TRPC subunits form a functional\nTRPC1 interact with the N-terminal CCD and C-terminal 707-735 region of TRPC5. In conclusion, the N-terminal CCD of TRPC channels is essential for the heteromultimeric structure of TRPC channels, whereas specific C-terminal regions are required for unique heteromerization between subgroups of TRPC channels. The phospholipid-binding protein SESTD1 is a novel regulator of the transient receptor potential channels TRPC4 and TRPC5. TRPC4 and TRPC5 are two closely related members of the mammalian transient receptor potential cation channel family that have been implicated in important physiological functions, such as growth cone guidance and smooth muscle contraction. To further unravel the role of TRPC4 and TRPC5 in these processes in vivo, detailed information about the molecular composition of native channel complexes and their association with cellular signaling networks is needed. We therefore searched a human aortic cDNA library for novel TRPC4-interacting proteins using a modified yeast two-hybrid assay. This screen identified SESTD1, a\nTRPC4 and TRPC5 channels. Interestingly, the C-terminal NHERF binding suppresses, while the dissociation of NHERF enables, the DAG sensitivity of the TRPC4 and TRPC5 channels. This leads to the assumption that all of the TRPC channels are DAG sensitive. The identification of the regulatory function of the NHERF proteins in the TRPC4/5-NHERF protein complex offers a new starting point to get deeper insights into the molecular basis of TRPC channel activation. Future studies will have to unravel the physiological and pathophysiological functions of this multi-protein channel complex. Opposite regulatory effects of TRPC1 and TRPC5 on neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. The transient receptor potential (TRPC) family of Ca\u00b2\u207a permeable, non-selective cation channels is abundantly expressed in the brain, and can function as store-operated (SOC) and store-independent channels depending on their interaction with the ER Ca\u00b2\u207a sensor STIM1. TRPC1 and TRPC5 have critical roles in neurite outgrowth, however which of their\nfear. Extracellular disulfide bridges stabilize TRPC5 dimerization, trafficking, and activity. Crucial cysteine residues can be involved in the modulation of protein activity via the modification of thiol (-SH) groups. Among these reactions, disulfide bonds (S-S) play a key role in the folding, stability, and activity of membrane proteins. However, the regulation of extracellular cysteines in classical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels remains controversial. Here, we examine the functional importance of the extracellular disulfide bond in TRPC5 in modulating channel gating and trafficking. Specifically, we investigated TRPC5 activity in transiently transfected HEK293 cells with wild-type (WT) or cysteine (C553 and C558) mutants in the pore loop. Using reducing agents, we determined that a disulfide linkage mediates the tetrameric formation of the TRPC5 channel. By measuring the TRPC5 current, we observed that C553S or C558S mutants completely lose channel activity induced by lanthanides or receptor stimulation. Co-expression of TRPC5 (WT) with mutants\noxidative stress and decreased TRPC1 expression contribute to neuronal damage in the striatum and may underlie neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease. Inhibition of TRPC5 channels by Ca2+-binding protein 1 in Xenopus oocytes. The transient receptor potential canonical type 5 (TRPC5) channel is a member of the channels that has been implicated in neurite extension and growth cone morphology of hippocampal neurons. Although homomeric TRPC5 channels are activated following stimulation of G(q/11)-coupled receptors, the exact mechanism for this activation remains unresolved. Using two-electrode voltage clamp recordings, we show that the activity of TRPC5 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes is dependent on the presence of Ca2+ at the extracellular as well as the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. TRPC5 was activated by the stimulation of coexpressed M5 muscarinic receptors or by ionomycin. The TRPC5 activity was detectable with the presence of submillimolar levels of extracellular Ca2+, but it was eliminated by the\nand increases the intracellular Ca2+ concentration via its own Ca2+ permeability and via the activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. TRPC4 and TRPC5: receptor-operated Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channels. The seven mammalian channels from the classical (TRPC) subfamily of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are thought to be receptor-operated cation channels activated in a phospholipase C (PLC)-dependent manner. Based on sequence similarity, TRPC channels can be divided into four subgroups. Group 4 comprises TRPC4 and TRPC5, and is most closely related to group 1 (TRPC1). The functional properties observed following heterologous expression of TRPC4 or TRPC5 in mammalian cells are contradictory and, therefore, controversial. In our hands, and in several independent studies, both channels, probably as homotetramers, form receptor-operated, Ca2+-permeable, nonselective cation channels activated independently of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3)) receptor activation or Ca2+ store-depletion. As heteromultimers with TRPC1, TRPC4 and TRPC5 form receptor-operated, Ca2+-permeable, nonselective cation channels with biophysical properties distinct from\na primary role in S1P-evoked cell motility. The data suggest S1P sensing by TRPC5 calcium channel is a mechanism contributing to vascular smooth muscle adaptation. Increased TRPC5 glutathionylation contributes to striatal neuron loss in Huntington's disease. Aberrant glutathione or Ca(2+) homeostasis due to oxidative stress is associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. The Ca(2+)-permeable transient receptor potential cation (TRPC) channel is predominantly expressed in the brain, which is sensitive to oxidative stress. However, the role of the TRPC channel in neurodegeneration is not known. Here, we report a mechanism of TRPC5 activation by oxidants and the effect of glutathionylated TRPC5 on striatal neurons in Huntington's disease. Intracellular oxidized glutathione leads to TRPC5 activation via TRPC5 S-glutathionylation at Cys176/Cys178 residues. The oxidized glutathione-activated TRPC5-like current results in a sustained increase in cytosolic Ca(2+), activated calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and the calpain-caspase pathway, ultimately inducing striatal neuronal cell death. We observed an\nuncover the molecular basis of TRPC5's function in dendrite patterning. We identify the major protein kinase calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II \u03b2 (CaMKII\u03b2) as a critical effector of TRPC5 function in neurons. Remarkably, TRPC5 forms a complex specifically with CaMKII\u03b2, but not the closely related kinase CaMKII\u03b1, and thereby induces the CaMKII\u03b2-dependent phosphorylation of the ubiquitin ligase Cdc20-APC at the centrosome. Accordingly, centrosomal CaMKII\u03b2 signaling mediates the ability of TRPC5 to regulate dendrite morphogenesis in neurons. Our findings define a novel function for TRPC5 that couples calcium signaling to a ubiquitin ligase pathway at the centrosome and thereby orchestrates dendrite patterning and connectivity in the brain. A sphingosine-1-phosphate-activated calcium channel controlling vascular smooth muscle cell motility. In a screen of potential lipid regulators of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, we identified sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) as an activator of TRPC5. We explored the relevance to vascular biology because S1P is a key cardiovascular signaling\nTRPC1-induced neurite outgrowth was independent of TRPC1-mediated Ca\u00b2\u207a influx. Thus, a) TRPC1 and TRPC5 similarly increased Ca\u00b2\u207a influx but only TRPC1 induced neurite outgrowth, b) the constitutively STIM1(D76A) mutant that activates Ca\u00b2\u207a influx by TRPC and Orai channels did not increase neurite outgrowth, c) co-expression of TRPC5 with TRPC1 suppressed the effect of TRPC1 on neurite outgrowth, d) and most notable, channel-dead pore mutant of TRPC1 increased neurite outgrowth to the same extent as TRPC1(WT). Suppression of TRPC1-induced neurite outgrowth by TRPC5 was due to a marked reduction in the surface expression of TRPC1. We conclude that the regulation of neurite outgrowth by TRPC1 is independent of Ca\u00b2\u207a influx and TRPC1-promoted neurite outgrowth depends on the surface expression of TRPC1. It is likely that TRPC1 acts as a scaffold at the cell surface to assemble a signaling complex to stimulate neurite outgrowth. Functional Characterization of Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) Channel\ncontrol of axon guidance and vascular smooth muscle cell migration and contractility. Recent studies of Trpc5 gene knockouts begin to uncover its roles in fear, anxiety, seizures, and cold sensing. Nitric oxide lacks direct effect on TRPC5 channels but suppresses endogenous TRPC5-containing channels in endothelial cells. TRPC5 is a member of the canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) family of proteins that forms cationic channels either through homomultimeric assembly or heteromultimeric coordination with other TRPC proteins. It is expressed in a variety of cells including central neurones and endothelial cells and has susceptibility to stimulation by multiple factors. Here we investigated if TRPC5 is sensitive to nitric oxide. Mouse TRPC5 or human TRPC5 was over-expressed in HEK293 cells, and TRPC5 activity was determined by measuring the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration with an indicator dye or by recording membrane current under voltage clamp. TRPC5 activity could be evoked by carbachol acting at muscarinic\nindicator dye or by recording membrane current under voltage clamp. TRPC5 activity could be evoked by carbachol acting at muscarinic receptors, lanthanum, or a reducing agent. However, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) and diethylamine NONOate (DEA-NONOate) failed to stimulate or inhibit TRPC5 at concentrations that generated nitric oxide, caused vasorelaxation, or suppressed activity of TRPC6 via protein kinase G. At high concentrations, SNAP (but not DEA-NONOate) occasionally stimulated TRPC5 but the effect was confounded by background TRPC5-independent Ca(2+) signals. Endogenous Ca(2+)-entry in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) was suppressed by SNAP; TRPC5 blocking antibody or dominant-negative mutant TRPC5 suppressed this Ca(2+) entry and occluded the effect of SNAP. The data suggest that nitric oxide is not a direct modulator of homomeric TRPC5 channels but may inhibit endogenous BAEC channels that contain TRPC5. A TRPC5-regulated calcium signaling pathway controls dendrite patterning in the mammalian brain. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels have been implicated as",

Efficient transcription termination is particularly critical for gene-dense bacterial and archaeal genomes1-3 in which continued transcription would necessarily transcribe immediately adjacent genes and result in conflicts between the transcription and replication apparatuses4-6; the coupling of transcription and translation7,8 would permit the loading of ribosomes onto aberrant transcripts. Only select sequences or transcription termination factors can disrupt the otherwise extremely stable TEC and we demonstrate that one of the last universally conserved archaeal proteins with unknown biological function is the Factor that terminates transcription in Archaea (FttA). FttA resolves the dichotomy of a prokaryotic gene structure (operons and polarity) and eukaryotic molecular homology (general transcription apparatus) that is observed in Archaea. This missing link between prokaryotic and eukaryotic transcription regulation provides the most parsimonious link to the evolution of the processing activities involved\ncomplex have robust 5'-to-3' exoribonuclease activity in vitro, RNase J2 has at least two orders of magnitude weaker exonuclease activity, providing a possible explanation for why RNase J1 is essential. The association of the two proteins also has an effect on the endoribonucleolytic properties of RNases J1 and J2. While the individual enzymes have similar endonucleolytic cleavage activities and specificities, as a complex they behave synergistically to alter cleavage site preference and to increase cleavage efficiency at specific sites. These observations dramatically change our perception of how these ribonucleases function and provide an interesting example of enzyme subfunctionalization after gene duplication. FttA is a CPSF73 homologue that terminates transcription in Archaea. Regulated gene expression is largely achieved by controlling the activities of essential, multisubunit RNA polymerase transcription elongation complexes (TECs). The extreme stability required of TECs to processively transcribe large genomic regions necessitates robust mechanisms to terminate transcription. Efficient transcription\nwas observed for enolase, where rifampicin addition was accompanied by an accumulation towards the cell center (Figure 3). This effect was visually less pronounced than for RNase Y, but still noticeable by eye; confined tracks of enolase also shifted away from the periphery towards the cell middle. An effect similarly striking as for RNase Y was seen for PNPase and for CshA (Figure 3). However, neither RNase J1, nor J2, nor PfkA revealed considerable differences in the confinement maps or the heat maps between unperturbed growth and inhibition of transcription. RNase J1 showed a weak accumulation towards the membrane in the heat map, which appeared to be weakened after treatment, while RNase J2 showed a weak accumulation after treatment in the cell center, which was not apparent during exponential growth. Thus, RNase Y, CshA, PNPase and enolase show similar responses to an arrest in transcription in terms of single molecule\nY-mV dynamics compared between wild type cells and two different mutant backgrounds, deletion of pfkA or of rnjB (encoding for RNase J2).

Conversely, our findings suggest that RNase J1, RNase J2 and PfkA molecules are not quantitatively part of the degradosome, as compared to RNase Y. RNase Y, PNPase, CshA and enolase change their pattern of localization in response to inhibition of transcription We wished to obtain spatial information on changes occurring to putative RNA degradosome components in response to a reduction in cellular RNA levels. We therefore projected tracks obtained into a standardized cell of 1 \u00d7 3 \u03bcm size, an average size for growing B. subtilis cells. We sorted tracks into those that show an extended period of little to no movement, termed \u2018confinement\u2019, where molecules stop much longer than would be expected from stochastic slow-mobile events during free diffusion. Confined movement occurs when molecules become bound to larger structures; for RNase\n0.7 pop2 (%) 50 \u00b1 0.6 69.9 \u00b1 0.6 D1 (\u03bcm2 s\u22121) 0.026 \u00b1 0.0006 D2 (\u03bcm2 s\u22121) 0.3 \u00b1 0.004 \u03f5 in this context means <10\u20136. The low confident interval amplitude is due to the high number of data. According to tracks obtained for RNase Y, 48.2 \u00b1 0.6% of the molecules were in a slow-mobile state, and thus likely actively involved in mRNA degradation or RNA processing, while 51.8 \u00b1 0.3% are in the mobile state (Table 1), illustrated by the size of the bubbles in Figure 2C, blue panel. We further analysed RNase Y and the other four proteins using two population fits, which also explained data much better for the other RNases and glycolytic enzymes than single fits (Supplementary Figure S2). Thus, for RNase J1, RNase J2, PNPase, CshA, PfkA and enolase, we found a slow mobile/static fraction similar to that found for RNase Y (Figure\nupon inhibition of transcription (Figure 6C), showing that RNA synthesis strongly affects the subcellular diffusion of RNase Y, and possibly of other proteins.

Absence of PfkA, and to a minor degree of RNase J2, leads to strong differences in RNase Y molecule dynamics We did not observe strong changes in RNase J1, RNase J2 and PfkA molecules upon inhibition of transcription (Figures 2 and 3). Because this does not necessarily mean that a small\nThe size of the fractions found in untreated or treated cells is represented as bubbles in panels C. A strong shift in RNase Y mobility as well as of that of PNPase, CshA and enolase can easily be seen in Figure 2C by the overlays of tracks from exponential growth (not filled) and those from rifampicin-treated cells (filled bars), but not to a considerable extent for RNase J1 and J2, or for PfkA. In contrast to RNase Y, RNase J2 molecules became even more static, the population increased from 37 \u00b1 2% to 51.2 \u00b1 2% in response to inhibition of transcription (Table 1). Thus, RNase Y becomes mobile due to a shortage in RNA substrates to bind to, as expected, and for enolase, apparently the same holds true, suggesting that many enolase molecules interact with mRNA (likely via RNase Y) as a component of the RNA degradosome. Conversely, our\nand PfkA molecules upon inhibition of transcription (Figures 2 and 3). Because this does not necessarily mean that a small number of molecules may be implicated in the formation of the RNA degradosome, we used changes of RNase Y dynamics as an indicator of whether RNase J2 and PfkA may influence RNA degradosome motility by tracking RNase Y-mVenus in the corresponding deletion strains {note that a strain lacking RNase J1 is not viable }. Figure 7A shows that RNase Y single molecule dynamics were markedly altered in the absence of PfkA, and to a minor degree in cells lacking RNase J2. Please note that in order to better compare changes in dynamics, D values best-fitting for all three types of cells were determined and kept constant, such that only fraction sizes vary. Thus, in reality, D as well as population sizes are different, but in our analyses, we consider changes\nantisense RNA SR7 binds to enolase thereby enhancing the enzymatic activity of enolase bound RNase Y. We discuss the role of small proteins in modulating the activity of two moonlighting proteins. Bacillus subtilis ribonucleases J1 and J2 form a complex with altered enzyme behaviour. Ribonucleases J1 and J2 are recently discovered enzymes with dual 5'-to-3' exoribonucleolytic/endoribonucleolytic activity that plays a key role in the maturation and degradation of Bacillus subtilis RNAs. RNase J1 is essential, while its paralogue RNase J2 is not. Up to now, it had generally been assumed that the two enzymes functioned independently. Here we present evidence that RNases J1 and J2 form a complex that is likely to be the predominant form of these enzymes in wild-type cells. While both RNase J1 and the RNase J1/J2 complex have robust 5'-to-3' exoribonuclease activity in vitro, RNase J2 has at least two orders of magnitude weaker exonuclease activity,\nJ2, PNPase, CshA, PfkA and enolase, we found a slow mobile/static fraction similar to that found for RNase Y (Figure 2C, Table 1). The fact that these slow diffusion constants varied by a factor of more than two may indicate that e.g. RNase J1 or enolase may be present in additional complexes, because at the fast acquisition rates used, we cannot distinguish between different slow-mobile states of molecules. The fact that enolase, PfkA and RNase J molecules had different values for D2 can be explained by their different sizes, although the D of 0.26 \u00b1 0.004 \u03bcm2/s is very low for this 46 kDa protein. At present, we have no explanation for this unusually low mobility for enolase, with about 60% of molecules even being in the slow mobile/static state (Table 1). Importantly, Figure 2B shows that for RNase Y, there is a strong shift of step sizes towards larger\n\u00b1 0.004 \u03c4 (1-comp.) (s) 0.1 \u00b1 0.0025 0.099 \u00b1 0.002 \u03c41 (2-comp.)

Figure 4 illustrates that average dwell times for RNase Y decreased significantly following rifampicin treatment, and even more pronounced for enolase, while PNPase and CshA showed less pronounced, yet significant reductions in dwell times. This was not observed for RNase J1 and J2, nor for PfkA, which did not reveal significant changes in response to lowering of mRNA levels. Of note, while our analyses contain many long tracks that allow for a sufficiently reliable deduction of dwell times, actual dwell times in vivo will be longer, as our analyses involve bleaching of molecules, which leads to an underestimation of dwell times. Additionally, lack of changes\nlink between prokaryotic and eukaryotic transcription regulation provides the most parsimonious link to the evolution of the processing activities involved in RNA 3'-end formation in Eukarya. Study of key RNA metabolism proteins in Enterococcus faecalis. The control of mRNA turnover is essential in bacteria to allow rapid adaptation, especially in opportunistic pathogen like Enterococcus faecalis. This mechanism involves RNase and DEAD-box helicases that are key elements in RNA processing and their associations form the degradosome with accessory proteins. In this study, we investigated the function of four RNases (J1, J2, Y and III) and three DEAD-box helicases (CshA, CshB, CshC) present in most Enterococci. The interactions of all these RNA metabolism actors were investigated in vitro, and the results are in accordance with a degradosome structure close to the one of Bacillus subtilis. At the physiological level, we showed that RNase J1 is essential, whereas RNases J2 and III have\nRNase Y dimers). Given the abundance of mRNA within growing cells, these structures must be highly efficient to ensure timely degradation of mRNA. RNase Y shows at least two diffusive populations: a low mobile/static fraction and a mobile/diffusive fraction, which also holds true for the other degradosome components. RNase Y and enolase become much more mobile in response to tuning down of transcription, suggesting that in the absence of substrate, they lose static motion within the degradosomes. This behaviour was not found for RNase J1 and J2, nor for PfkA. However, we observed that in the absence of PfkA or of RNase J2, the mobility of RNase Y molecules is considerably altered, in that they become more static. These data suggest that RNase J2 and PfkA may affect the efficiency of active RNase Y molecules, or may influence RNase Y turnover in terms of unbinding and rebinding to mRNA substrate,\ndegradation. Exo-ribonucleolytic degradation proceeds in the 5' to 3' direction and is sensitive to the phosphorylation state of the 5' end of a transcript. Recent phylogenomic analyses have shown that the \u03b2-CASP ribonucleases can be partitioned into two major subdivisions that correspond to orthologs of eukaryal CPSF73 and bacterial RNase J. We discuss the known functions of the CPSF73 and RNase J orthologs, their association into complexes, and their structure as it relates to mechanism of action. Eukaryal CPSF73 is part of a large multiprotein complex that is involved in the maturation of the 3' end of RNA Polymerase II transcripts and the polyadenylation of messenger RNA. RNase J1 and J2 are paralogs in Bacillus subtilis that are involved in the degradation of messenger RNA and the maturation of non-coding RNA. RNase J1 and J2 co-purify as a heteromeric complex and there is recent evidence that they interact with other\nit was necessary to add methionine (50 \u03bcg/ml) and tryptophane (50 \u03bcg/ml). The strain in which enolase-mV was induced at low level was treated with 0.01% xylose for 1 h. All proteins were visualized as mVenus (mV) fusions. B. subtilis mV-fusions of RNase Y, RNase J1, RNase J2 and PfkA were created with the use of plasmid pSG1164-mV, generating a C-terminal fusion at the original locus of the gene by a single-crossover event. At least 500 bp of the 3'end of the desired gene (excluding the stop codon) were amplified by PCR cloned by Gibson Assembly into the vector in frame with the linker and mV sequence. The necessary Gibson primers had an overhang of at least 20 bp (Supplementary Table S1). For enolase we generated an ectopic fusion in order to express a low level of the enzyme that itself is present in the cell with a high copy\nof transcription or in mutant backgrounds. Considering three populations, RNase Y still becomes less mobile in the absence of PfkA, and to a smaller extent in cells devoid of RNase J2: while medium-mobile fractions remain relatively similar between wild type and mutant cells, fast-mobile fractions decrease in favour of static fractions (Figure 7B, Table 2). Consistent with these findings, we observed that cells expressing RNase Y-mVenus as sole source of the proteins grow with a doubling time indistinguishable from that of cells lacking the fusion (i.e. expressing wild type RNase Y), but show a growth defect in the absence of PfkA or of RNase J2 (Supplementary Figure S6), while pfkA or rnjB mutant cells grow with wild type-like doubling time. These data suggest that while the fusion of RNase Y and mVenus can complement the function of wild type RNase Y in wild type cells, absence of phosphofructokinase or of",

The DLN comprises the major endoribonuclease RNase Y, 3'-5' exoribonuclease PnpA, endo/5'-3' exoribonucleases J1/J2 and helicase CshA. We have ascertained that the metabolic enzyme GapA is an additional component of the DLN. In addition, we identified two small proteins that bind scaffolding components of the degradosome: SR1P encoded by the dual-function sRNA SR1 binds GapA, promotes the GapA-RNase J1 interaction and increases the RNase J1 activity.

Examining the Protein Interactome and Subcellular Localization of RNase J2 Complexes in Streptococcus mutans. Regulated RNA turnover is vital for the control of gene expression in all cellular life. In Escherichia coli, this process is largely controlled by a stable degradosome complex containing RNase E and a variety of additional enzymes. In the Firmicutes phylum, species lack RNase E and often encode the paralogous enzymes RNase J1 and RNase J2. Unlike RNase J1, surprisingly little is known about the regulatory function and protein interactions of RNase J2, despite being a central pleiotropic regulator for the streptococci and other closely related organisms. Using crosslink coimmunoprecipitation in Streptococcus mutans, we have identified the major proteins found within RNase J2 protein complexes located in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane. In both subcellular fractions, RNase J2 exhibited the most robust interactions with RNase J1, while additional transient and/or weaker \"degradosome-like\"\nthe other RNases and glycolytic enzymes than single fits (Supplementary Figure S2). Thus, for RNase J1, RNase J2, PNPase, CshA, PfkA and enolase, we found a slow mobile/static fraction similar to that found for RNase Y (Figure 2C, Table 1). The fact that these slow diffusion constants varied by a factor of more than two may indicate that e.g. RNase J1 or enolase may be present in additional complexes, because at the fast acquisition rates used, we cannot distinguish between different slow-mobile states of molecules. The fact that enolase, PfkA and RNase J molecules had different values for D2 can be explained by their different sizes, although the D of 0.26 \u00b1 0.004 \u03bcm2/s is very low for this 46 kDa protein. At present, we have no explanation for this unusually low mobility for enolase, with about 60% of molecules even being in the slow mobile/static state (Table 1). Importantly,\nof bacterial species, has been shown to possess both endo- and 5' to 3' exo-ribonuclease activities. The exonucleolytic activity is clearly involved in the degradation of mRNA and in the maturation of at least the 5' end of 16S rRNA in the 2 Firmicutes Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. The endoribonuclease activity of RNase J from several species has been shown to be weak in vitro and 3-D structural data of different RNase J orthologs have not provided a clear explanation for the molecular basis of this activity. Here, we show that S. aureus RNase J1 is a manganese dependent homodimeric enzyme with strong 5' to 3' exo-ribonuclease as well as endo-ribonuclease activity. In addition, we demonstrated that SauJ1 can efficiently degrade 5' triphosphorylated RNA. Our results highlight RNase J1 as an important player in RNA turnover in S. aureus. Novel activities of glycolytic enzymes in Bacillus subtilis: interactions with\nthe archaea suggesting a role for these enzymes in the maturation and/or degradation of messenger RNA. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: RNA Decay mechanisms. Structural and biochemical characteristics of two Staphylococcus epidermidis RNase J paralogs RNase J1 and RNase J2. RNase J enzymes are metallohydrolases that are involved in RNA maturation and RNA recycling, govern gene expression in bacteria, and catalyze both exonuclease and endonuclease activity. The catalytic activity of RNase J is regulated by multiple mechanisms which include oligomerization, conformational changes to aid substrate recognition, and the metal cofactor at the active site. However, little is known of how RNase J paralogs differ in expression and activity. Here we describe structural and biochemical features of two Staphylococcus epidermidis RNase J paralogs, RNase J1 and RNase J2. RNase J1 is a homodimer with exonuclease activity aided by two metal cofactors at the active site. RNase J2,\nof RNAs in prokaryotes. The B. subtilis enzyme possesses both 5'-3' exoribonucleolytic and endonucleolytic activity, an unusual property for a ribonuclease. Here, we present the crystal structure of T. thermophilus RNase J bound to a 4 nucleotide RNA. The structure reveals an RNA-binding channel that illustrates how the enzyme functions in 5'-3' exoribonucleolytic mode and how it can function as an endonuclease. A second, negatively charged tunnel leads from the active site, and is ideally located to evacuate the cleaved nucleotide in 5'-3' exonucleolytic mode. We show that B. subtilis RNase J1, which shows processive behavior on long RNAs, behaves distributively for substrates less than 5 nucleotides in length. We propose a model involving the binding of the RNA to the surface of the \u03b2-CASP domain to explain the enzyme's processive action.

We further analysed RNase Y and the other four proteins using two population fits, which also explained data much better for the other RNases and glycolytic enzymes than single fits (Supplementary Figure S2). Thus, for RNase J1, RNase J2, PNPase, CshA,\nIn both subcellular fractions, RNase J2 exhibited the most robust interactions with RNase J1, while additional transient and/or weaker \"degradosome-like\" interactions were also detected. In addition, RNase J2 exhibits multiple novel interactions that have not been previously reported for any RNase J proteins, some of which were highly biased for either the cytoplasmic or membrane fractions. We also determined that the RNase J2 C-terminal domain (CTD) encodes a structure that is likely conserved among RNase J enzymes and may have an analogous function to the C-terminal portion of RNase E. While we did observe a number of parallels between the RNase J2 interactome and the E. coli degradosome paradigm, our results suggest that S. mutans degradosomes are either unlikely to exist or are quite distinct from those of E. coli. Single molecule/particle tracking analysis program SMTracker 2.0 reveals different dynamics of proteins within the RNA degradosome complex in Bacillus subtilis\nbound RNase Y. We discuss the role of small proteins in modulating the activity of two moonlighting proteins. Bacillus subtilis ribonucleases J1 and J2 form a complex with altered enzyme behaviour. Ribonucleases J1 and J2 are recently discovered enzymes with dual 5'-to-3' exoribonucleolytic/endoribonucleolytic activity that plays a key role in the maturation and degradation of Bacillus subtilis RNAs. RNase J1 is essential, while its paralogue RNase J2 is not. Up to now, it had generally been assumed that the two enzymes functioned independently. Here we present evidence that RNases J1 and J2 form a complex that is likely to be the predominant form of these enzymes in wild-type cells. While both RNase J1 and the RNase J1/J2 complex have robust 5'-to-3' exoribonuclease activity in vitro, RNase J2 has at least two orders of magnitude weaker exonuclease activity, providing a possible explanation for why RNase J1 is essential.

RNase J1 is a homodimer with exonuclease activity aided by two metal cofactors at the active site. RNase J2, on the other hand, has endonuclease activity and one metal ion at the active site and is predominantly a monomer. We note that the expression levels of these enzymes vary across Staphylococcal strains. Together, these observations suggest that multiple interacting RNase J paralogs could provide a strategy for functional improvisation utilizing differences in intracellular concentration, quaternary structure, and distinct active site architecture despite overall structural similarity. Moonlighting in Bacillus subtilis: The Small Proteins SR1P and SR7P Regulate the Moonlighting Activity of Glyceraldehyde 3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase A (GapA) and Enolase in RNA Degradation. Moonlighting proteins are proteins with more than one function. During the past 25 years, they have been found to be rather widespread in bacteria. In Bacillus subtilis, moonlighting has been disclosed to occur via DNA, protein or RNA binding\nWhat is the role of RNase J in mRNA turnover? The discovery of the paralogous ribonucleases J1 and J2 has been a major advance in the study of RNA maturation and decay in Bacillus subtilis and related organisms. RNase J1 was the first bacterial enzyme shown to possess 5'-to-3' exoribonuclease activity, reversing a dogma that suggested this type of activity was unique to eukaryotic mRNA decay. RNase J1 and J2 form a complex that also has endonuclease activity and these enzymes have been shown to play a key role in the turnover and maturation of many RNAs in B. subtilis. Here, I describe recent progress in our understanding of the role of these enzymes in RNA metabolism in this organism and argue that the 5'-to-3' exoribonuclease activity may be the more important of the complex's two modes of action.

In fact, the diffusion constant determined for the static fraction with D = 0.031 \u00b1 0.001 \u03bcm2/s (Table 1) is similar to that determined for translating 70S ribosomes/polysomes with D = 0.055 \u03bcm2/s, suggesting that this fraction of RNase Y is within a large protein/RNA complex. The diffusion constant of the fast-mobile fraction with D = 0.3 \u00b1 0.002 \u03bcm2/s is quite low for a freely diffusive protein, compared with diffusion coefficients obtained before (free mVenus has a coefficient of 5 \u03bcm2/s within B. subtilis cells). Possibly, the mobile fraction of RNase Y is composed of freely diffusing dimers (see further below for this point) as well as of molecules in transition towards binding to mRNA. Also, tracking of RNase Y at 40\na length of 3 \u03bcm, roughly the average of exponentially growing cells. A comparable effect of relocation was observed for enolase, where rifampicin addition was accompanied by an accumulation towards the cell center (Figure 3). This effect was visually less pronounced than for RNase Y, but still noticeable by eye; confined tracks of enolase also shifted away from the periphery towards the cell middle. An effect similarly striking as for RNase Y was seen for PNPase and for CshA (Figure 3). However, neither RNase J1, nor J2, nor PfkA revealed considerable differences in the confinement maps or the heat maps between unperturbed growth and inhibition of transcription. RNase J1 showed a weak accumulation towards the membrane in the heat map, which appeared to be weakened after treatment, while RNase J2 showed a weak accumulation after treatment in the cell center, which was not apparent during exponential growth. Thus, RNase Y,\ntwo orders of magnitude weaker exonuclease activity, providing a possible explanation for why RNase J1 is essential. The association of the two proteins also has an effect on the endoribonucleolytic properties of RNases J1 and J2. While the individual enzymes have similar endonucleolytic cleavage activities and specificities, as a complex they behave synergistically to alter cleavage site preference and to increase cleavage efficiency at specific sites. These observations dramatically change our perception of how these ribonucleases function and provide an interesting example of enzyme subfunctionalization after gene duplication. Both exo- and endo-nucleolytic activities of RNase J1 from Staphylococcus aureus are manganese dependent and active on triphosphorylated 5'-ends. RNA decay and RNA maturation are important steps in the regulation of bacterial gene expression. RNase J, which is present in about half of bacterial species, has been shown to possess both endo- and 5' to 3' exo-ribonuclease activities. The exonucleolytic activity is\nin RNA substrates to bind to, as expected, and for enolase, apparently the same holds true, suggesting that many enolase molecules interact with mRNA (likely via RNase Y) as a component of the RNA degradosome. Conversely, our findings suggest that RNase J1, RNase J2 and PfkA molecules are not quantitatively part of the degradosome, as compared to RNase Y. RNase Y, PNPase, CshA and enolase change their pattern of localization in response to inhibition of transcription We wished to obtain spatial information on changes occurring to putative RNA degradosome components in response to a reduction in cellular RNA levels. We therefore projected tracks obtained into a standardized cell of 1 \u00d7 3 \u03bcm size, an average size for growing B. subtilis cells. We sorted tracks into those that show an extended period of little to no movement, termed \u2018confinement\u2019, where molecules stop much longer than would be expected from stochastic\n(%) 17.6 \u00b1 3.78 13.2 \u00b1 2.15 RNase J1 Average residence time (s) 0.119 \u00b1 0.003 0.121 \u00b1 0.004 \u03c4 (1-comp.)

At least 500 bp of the 3'end of the desired gene (excluding the stop codon) were amplified by PCR cloned by Gibson Assembly into the vector in frame with the linker and mV sequence.

All these structures show the dimeric T. vivax nucleoside hydrolase with an \"open\" active site with a highly flexible loop (loop 2) in its vicinity. Here, we present the crystal structures of the T. vivax nucleoside hydrolase with both soaked (TvNH-ImmH(soak)) and co-crystallised (TvNH-ImmH(co)) transition-state inhibitor immucillin H (ImmH or (1S)-1-(9-deazahypoxanthin-9-yl)-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-ribitol) to 2.1 A and 2.2 A resolution, respectively. In the co-crystallised structure, loop 2 is ordered and folds over the active site, establishing previously unobserved enzyme-inhibitor interactions. As such this structure presents the first complete picture of a purine-specific NH active site, including leaving group interactions. In the closed active site, a water channel of highly ordered water molecules leads out from the N7 of the nucleoside toward bulk solvent, while Trp260 approaches the nucleobase in a tight parallel stacking interaction. Together with mutagenesis results, this structure rules out\nsolvent, while Trp260 approaches the nucleobase in a tight parallel stacking interaction. Together with mutagenesis results, this structure rules out a mechanism of leaving group activation by general acid catalysis, as proposed for base-aspecific nucleoside hydrolases. Instead, the structure is consistent with the previously proposed mechanism of leaving group protonation in the T. vivax nucleoside hydrolase where aromatic stacking with Trp260 and an intramolecular O5'-H8C hydrogen bond increase the pKa of the N7 sufficiently to allow protonation by solvent. A mechanism that couples loop closure to the positioning of active site residues is proposed based on a comparison of the soaked structure with the co-crystallized structure. Interestingly, the dimer interface area increases by 40% upon closure of loop 2, with loop 1 of one subunit interacting with loop 2 of the other subunit, suggesting a relationship between the dimeric form of the enzyme and its catalytic activity. Structural and biochemical\nequivalent in mammalian cells. We cloned, expressed and purified a nucleoside hydrolase from Trypanosoma vivax. The substrate activity profile establishes the enzyme to be a member of the inosine-adenosine-guanosine-preferring nucleoside hydrolases (IAG-NH). We solved the crystal structure of the enzyme at 1.6 A resolution using MAD techniques. The complex of the enzyme with the substrate analogue 3-deaza-adenosine is presented. These are the first structures of an IAG-NH reported in the literature. The T. vivax IAG-NH is a homodimer, with each subunit consisting of ten beta-strands, 12 alpha-helices and three small 3(10)-helices. Six of the eight strands of the central beta-sheet form a motif resembling the Rossmann fold. Superposition of the active sites of this IAG-NH and the inosine-uridine-preferring nucleoside hydrolase (IU-NH) of Crithidia fasciculata shows the molecular basis of the different substrate specificity distinguishing these two classes of nucleoside hydrolases.

Enzymes with nucleoside hydrolase (NH) activity are crucial for salvaging nucleic acid components in purine auxotrophic protozoan parasites, but are also present in prokaryotes and higher eukaryotes. Here we analyze the distribution of genes encoding for putative NH proteins and characterize the yeiK gene product from Escherichia coli as a pyrimidine-specific NH. The crystal structure of YeiK to 1.7 A defines the structural basis for its substrate specificity and identifies residues involved in the catalytic mechanism that differ from both nonspecific and purine-specific NHs. Large differences in the tetrameric quaternary structure compared to nonspecific protozoan NHs are brought forth by minor differences in the interacting surfaces. The first structural and functional characterization of a nonparasitic, pyrimidine nucleoside-specific NH suggests a possible role for these enzymes in the metabolism of tRNA\nwidely accepted model of plant purine nucleotide catabolism, xanthine can be generated in various ways involving either inosine and hypoxanthine or guanosine and xanthosine as intermediates. In a comprehensive mutant analysis involving single and multiple mutants of urate oxidase, xanthine dehydrogenase, nucleoside hydrolases, guanosine deaminase, and hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, we demonstrate that purine nucleotide catabolism in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mainly generates xanthosine, but not inosine and hypoxanthine, and that xanthosine is derived from guanosine deamination and a second source, likely xanthosine monophosphate dephosphorylation. Nucleoside hydrolase 1 (NSH1) is known to be essential for xanthosine hydrolysis, but the in vivo function of a second cytosolic nucleoside hydrolase, NSH2, is unclear. We demonstrate that NSH1 activates NSH2 in vitro and in vivo, forming a complex with almost two orders of magnitude higher catalytic efficiency for xanthosine hydrolysis than observed for NSH1 alone. Remarkably, an inactive NSH1 point mutant can activate NSH2 in\nthe other subunit, suggesting a relationship between the dimeric form of the enzyme and its catalytic activity. Structural and biochemical characterization of the nucleoside hydrolase from C. elegans reveals the role of two active site cysteine residues in catalysis. Nucleoside hydrolases (NHs) catalyze the hydrolysis of the N-glycoside bond in ribonucleosides and are found in all three domains of life. Although in parasitic protozoa a role in purine salvage has been well established, their precise function in bacteria and higher eukaryotes is still largely unknown. NHs have been classified into three homology groups based on the conservation of active site residues. While many structures are available of representatives of group I and II, structural information for group III NHs is lacking. Here, we report the first crystal structure of a purine-specific nucleoside hydrolase belonging to homology group III from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (CeNH) to 1.65\u00c5 resolution. In contrast to\ndifferent substrate specificity distinguishing these two classes of nucleoside hydrolases. An \"aromatic stacking network\" in the active site of the IAG-NH, absent from the IU-NH, imposes the purine specificity. Asp10 is the proposed general base in the reaction mechanism, abstracting a proton from a nucleophilic water molecule. Asp40 (replaced by Asn39 in the IU-NH) is positioned appropriately to act as a general acid and to protonate the purine leaving group. The second general acid, needed for full enzymatic activity, is probably part of a flexible loop located in the vicinity of the active site. Transition-state complex of the purine-specific nucleoside hydrolase of T. vivax: enzyme conformational changes and implications for catalysis. Nucleoside hydrolases cleave the N-glycosidic bond of ribonucleosides. Crystal structures of the purine-specific nucleoside hydrolase from Trypanosoma vivax have previously been solved in complex with inhibitors or a substrate. All these structures show the dimeric T. vivax nucleoside hydrolase\npurine-specific nucleoside hydrolase belonging to homology group III from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (CeNH) to 1.65\u00c5 resolution. In contrast to dimeric purine-specific NHs from group II, CeNH is a homotetramer. A cysteine residue that characterizes group III NHs (Cys253) structurally aligns with the catalytic histidine and tryptophan residues of group I and group II enzymes, respectively. Moreover, a second cysteine (Cys42) points into the active site of CeNH. Substrate docking shows that both cysteine residues are appropriately positioned to interact with the purine ring. Site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analysis proposes a catalytic role for both cysteines residues, with Cys253 playing the most prominent role in leaving group activation.\ncatalytic efficiency for xanthosine hydrolysis than observed for NSH1 alone. Remarkably, an inactive NSH1 point mutant can activate NSH2 in vivo, fully preventing purine nucleoside accumulation in nsh1 background. Our data lead to an altered model of purine nucleotide catabolism that includes an NSH heterocomplex as a central component. Structure and function of a novel purine specific nucleoside hydrolase from Trypanosoma vivax. The purine salvage pathway of parasitic protozoa is currently considered as a target for drug development because these organisms cannot synthesize purines de novo. Insight into the structure and mechanism of the involved enzymes can aid in the development of potent inhibitors, leading to new curative drugs. Nucleoside hydrolases are key enzymes in the purine salvage pathway of Trypanosomatidae, and they are especially attractive because they have no equivalent in mammalian cells. We cloned, expressed and purified a nucleoside hydrolase from Trypanosoma vivax. The substrate activity profile establishes\nfunctional characterization of a nonparasitic, pyrimidine nucleoside-specific NH suggests a possible role for these enzymes in the metabolism of tRNA nucleosides. The high catalytic efficiency of YeiK toward 5-fluorouridine could be exploited for suicide gene therapy in cancer treatment. Structural explanation for the tunable substrate specificity of an E. coli nucleoside hydrolase: insights from molecular dynamics simulations. Parasitic protozoa rely on nucleoside hydrolases that play key roles in the purine salvage pathway by catalyzing the hydrolytic cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond that connects nucleobases to ribose sugars. Cytidine-uridine nucleoside hydrolase (CU-NH) is generally specific toward pyrimidine nucleosides; however, previous work has shown that replacing two active site residues with Tyr, specifically the Thr223Tyr and Gln227Tyr mutations, allows CU-NH to process inosine. The current study uses molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to gain atomic-level insight into the activity of wild-type and mutant E. coli CU-NH toward inosine. By examining systems that differ\ninto the active site. Investigation of the single CU-NH mutants reveals that this hydrogen-bonding network is only maintained when both Tyr mutations are present due to a \u03c0-interaction between the residues. These results rationalize previous experiments that show the single Tyr mutants are unable to efficiently hydrolyze inosine and explain how the Tyr residues work synergistically in the double mutant to stabilize the nucleobase leaving group during hydrolysis. Overall, our simulations provide a structural explanation for the substrate specificity of nucleoside hydrolases, which may be used to rationally develop new treatments for kinetoplastid diseases. AMP and GMP Catabolism in Arabidopsis Converge on Xanthosine, Which Is Degraded by a Nucleoside Hydrolase Heterocomplex. Plants can fully catabolize purine nucleotides. A firmly established central intermediate is the purine base xanthine. In the current widely accepted model of plant purine nucleotide catabolism, xanthine can be generated in various ways involving either inosine and hypoxanthine\ngain atomic-level insight into the activity of wild-type and mutant E. coli CU-NH toward inosine. By examining systems that differ in the identity and protonation states of active site catalytic residues, key enzyme-substrate interactions that dictate the substrate specificity of CU-NH are identified. Regardless of the wild-type or mutant CU-NH considered, our calculations suggest that inosine binding is facilitated by interactions of the ribose moiety with active site residues and Ca2+, and \u03c0-interactions between two His residues (His82 and His239) and the nucleobase. However, the lack of observed activity toward inosine for wild-type CU-NH is explained by no residue being correctly aligned to stabilize the departing nucleobase. In contrast, a hydrogen-bonding network between hypoxanthine and a newly identified general acid (Asp15) is present when the two Tyr mutations are engineered into the active site. Investigation of the single CU-NH mutants reveals that this hydrogen-bonding network is only maintained when both",

There are no direct contacts between the VSDs of the four subunits, and the contacts between these and the PDs are loose, suggesting that the VSDs are capable of functioning independently. Indeed, they manifest many inherent fluctuations that are decoupled from the rest of the structure. In general, the analysis suggests that the two domains contribute to the channel function both individually and cooperatively. Structural and functional characterization of Kv6.2 a new gamma-subunit of voltage-gated potassium channel. We have cloned and functionally expressed Kv6.2, a new member of the Kv6 subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channel subunits. The human Kv6.2 (KCNF2) gene was mapped at 18q22-18q23. Kv6.2 mRNA is preferentially expressed in rat and human myocard. Rat and human Kv6.2 subunits appear to be unable to form functional Kv channels in\nOur work exposes the multigenic, molecular etiology of a variant associated with epilepsy and reveals that charge-transfer-center disruption has different effects in KV1.2 and Shaker, the archetypes for potassium channel structure and function. The Kv\u03b22 subunit of voltage-gated potassium channels is interacting with ProSAP2/Shank3 in the PSD. The postsynaptic density is an electron dense meshwork composed of a variety of molecules facilitating neuronal signal transmission. ProSAP2/Shank3 represents a crucial player at postsynaptic sites, assembling large multimeric platforms and anchoring numerous other molecules, thereby linking the functional synapse with the cytoskeleton. ProSAP2/Shank3 is also implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including autism spectrum disorders. KvBeta2 (Kv\u03b22) on the other hand serves as a regulatory subunit of voltage-gated potassium channels. Kv\u03b22 is located at various sites in the neuron including the axon (binding to Kv1.2), the dendrites (binding to Kv4.2) and the synapse. Binding of Kv\u03b22 to either Kv1.2 or Kv4\nalpha subunit contains six transmembrane segments, including an intrinsic voltage sensor. In contrast, inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels have just two transmembrane segments in each of its four pore-lining alpha subunits. A variety of intracellular second messengers mediate transmitter and metabolic regulation of Kir channels. For example, Kir3 (GIRK) channels open on binding to the G protein betagamma subunits, thereby mediating slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in the brain. Our structure-based functional analysis on the cytoplasmic N-terminal tetramerization domain T1 of the voltage-gated channel, Kv1.2, uncovered a new function for this domain, modulation of voltage gating, and suggested a possible means of communication between second messenger pathways and Kv channels. A yeast screen for active Kir3.2 channels subjected to random mutagenesis has identified residues in the transmembrane segments that are crucial for controlling the opening of Kir3.2 channels. The identification of structural elements involved in potassium channel gating in these systems\nthe excitatory/inhibitory balance of neuronal circuits. Independent and cooperative motions of the Kv1.2 channel: voltage sensing and gating. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels, such as Kv1.2, are involved in the generation and propagation of action potentials. The Kv channel is a homotetramer, and each monomer is composed of a voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and a pore domain (PD). We analyzed the fluctuations of a model structure of Kv1.2 using elastic network models. The analysis suggested a network of coupled fluctuations of eight rigid structural units and seven hinges that may control the transition between the active and inactive states of the channel. For the most part, the network is composed of amino acids that are known to affect channel activity. The results suggested allosteric interactions and cooperativity between the subunits in the coupling between the motion of the VSD and the selectivity filter of the PD, in accordance with recent empirical data.\ninfancy and results from point mutations in the voltage-gated potassium channel gene hKv1.1. The hallmark of the disease is continuous myokymia and episodic attacks of spastic contractions of the skeletal muscles, which cause permanent disability. Coexpression of hKv1.1 and hKv1.2 subunits produces heteromeric potassium channels with biophysical and pharmacological properties intermediate between the respective homomers. By using tandemly linked subunits, we demonstrate that hKv1.1 subunits bearing the EA-1 mutations V408A and E325D combine with hKv1.2 to produce channels with altered kinetics of activation, deactivation, C-type inactivation, and voltage dependence. Moreover, hKv1.1V408A single-channel analysis reveals a approximately threefold reduction of the mean open duration of the channel compared with the wild-type, and this mutation alters the open-state stability of both homomeric and heteromeric channels. The results demonstrate that human Kv1.2 and Kv1.1 subunits coassemble to form a novel channel with distinct gating properties that are altered profoundly by EA-1 mutations, thus\na similar bidirectional regulation as in the Cav channels. The two effects could be distinguished kinetically, in terms of their sensitivities to PIP(2) and by distinct molecular determinants. The rightward shift of the Kv1.2 voltage dependence implicated basic residues in the S4-S5 linker and was consistent with stabilization of the inactive state of the voltage sensor. A third type of a voltage-gated ion channel modulated by PIP(2) is the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel. PIP(2) has been shown to enhance the opening of HCN channels by shifting their voltage-dependent activation toward depolarized potentials. The sea urchin HCN channel, SpIH, showed again a PIP(2)-mediated bidirectional effect but in reverse order than the depolarization-activated Cav and Kv channels: a voltage-dependent potentiation, like the mammalian HCN channels, but also an inhibition of the cGMP-induced current activation. Just like the Kv1.2 channels, distinct molecular determinants underlied the PIP(2) dual effects on SpIH, with the\nin mice lacking the potassium channel subunit Kv1.2, but hypoexcitability and enlarged Kv1 currents in auditory neurons. Genes Kcna1 and Kcna2 code for the voltage-dependent potassium channel subunits Kv1.1 and Kv1.2, which are coexpressed in large axons and commonly present within the same tetramers. Both contribute to the low-voltage-activated potassium current I Kv1, which powerfully limits excitability and facilitates temporally precise transmission of information, e.g., in auditory neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Kcna1-null mice lacking Kv1.1 exhibited seizure susceptibility and hyperexcitability in axons and MNTB neurons, which also had reduced I Kv1. To explore whether a lack of Kv1.2 would cause a similar phenotype, we created and characterized Kcna2-null mice (-/-). The -/- mice exhibited increased seizure susceptibility compared with their +/+ and +/- littermates, as early as P14. The mRNA for Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 increased strongly in +/+ brain stems between P7 and P14,\nmight be able to fine-tune their excitability by adjusting the Kv1.1:Kv1.2 balance rather than altering Kv1 channel density. The glycosylation state of Kv1.2 potassium channels affects trafficking, gating, and simulated action potentials. We presented evidence previously that decreasing the glycosylation state of the Kv1.1 potassium channel modified its gating by a combined surface potential and a cooperative subunit interaction mechanism and these effects modified simulated action potentials. Here we continued to test the hypothesis that glycosylation affects channel function in a predictable fashion by increasing and decreasing the glycosylation state of Kv1.2 channels. Compared with Kv1.2, increasing the glycosylation state shifted the V(1/2) negatively with a steeper G-V slope, increased activation kinetics with little change in deactivation kinetics or in their voltage-dependence, and decreased the apparent level of C-type inactivation. Decreasing the glycosylation state had essentially the opposite effects and shifted the V(1/2) positively with a shallower G-V slope, decreased\nThe glycosylation state of Kv1.2 also affected action potentials in simulations. In addition, preventing N-glycosylation decreased cell surface Kv1.2 expression levels by approximately 40% primarily by increasing partial endoplasmic reticulum retention and this effect was completely rescued by Kv1.4 subunits, which are glycosylated, but not by cytoplasmic Kvbeta2.1 subunits. The nonglycosylated Kv1.2 protein had a similar protein half-life as the glycosylated protein and appeared to be folded properly. Thus altering the native Kv1.2 glycosylation state affected its trafficking, gating, and simulated action potentials. Differential glycosylation of ion channels could be used by excitable cells to modify cell signaling. Mutations in the KCNA1 gene associated with episodic ataxia type-1 syndrome impair heteromeric voltage-gated K(+) channel function. Episodic ataxia type-1 syndrome (EA-1) is an autosomal dominant neurological disorder that manifests itself during infancy and results from point mutations in the voltage-gated potassium channel gene hKv1.1. The hallmark of the disease is continuous\n16 years, there has been an impressive number of ion channels shown to be sensitive to the major phosphoinositide in the plasma membrane, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)). Among them are voltage-gated channels, which are crucial for both neuronal and cardiac excitability. Voltage-gated calcium (Cav) channels were shown to be regulated bidirectionally by PIP(2). On one hand, PIP(2) stabilized their activity by reducing current rundown but on the other hand it produced a voltage-dependent inhibition by shifting the activation curve to more positive voltages. For voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels PIP(2) was first shown to prevent N-type inactivation regardless of whether the fast inactivation gate was part of the pore-forming \u03b1 subunit or of an accessory \u03b2 subunit. Careful examination of the effects of PIP(2) on the activation mechanism of Kv1.2 has shown a similar bidirectional regulation as in the Cav channels. The two effects could be distinguished kinetically, in terms of their\nvoltage-sensing domain of KV1.2-F302L channels is more sensitive to depolarization. Accordingly, KV1.2-F302L channels opened faster and at more negative potentials; however, they also exhibited enhanced inactivation: that is, F302L causes both gain- and loss-of-function effects. Coexpression of KCNA2-WT and -F302L did not fully rescue these effects. The proband's symptoms are more characteristic of patients with loss of KCNA2 function. Enhanced KV1.2 inactivation could lead to increased synaptic release in excitatory neurons, steering neuronal circuits towards epilepsy.ABSTRACT: An exome-based diagnostic panel in an infant with epilepsy revealed a previously unreported de novo missense variant in KCNA2, which encodes voltage-gated K+ channel KV1.2. This variant causes substitution F302L, in helix S4 of the KV1.2 voltage-sensing domain (VSD). F302L does not affect KCNA2 subunit membrane trafficking. However, it does alter channel functional properties, accelerating channel opening at more hyperpolarized membrane potentials, indicating gain of function. F302L also caused loss of KV1.2 function via\naccelerating channel opening at more hyperpolarized membrane potentials, indicating gain of function. F302L also caused loss of KV1.2 function via accelerated inactivation onset, decelerated recovery and shifted inactivation voltage dependence to more negative potentials. These effects, which are not fully rescued by coexpression of wild-type and mutant KCNA2 subunits, probably result from the enhancement of VSD function, as demonstrated by optically tracking VSD depolarization-evoked conformational rearrangements. In turn, molecular dynamics simulations suggest altered VSD exposure to membrane lipids. Compared to other encephalopathy patients with KCNA2 mutations, the proband exhibits mild neurological impairment, more characteristic of patients with KCNA2 loss of function. Based on this information, we propose a mechanism of epileptogenesis based on enhanced KV1.2 inactivation leading to increased synaptic release preferentially in excitatory neurons, and hence the perturbation of the excitatory/inhibitory balance of neuronal circuits. Independent and cooperative motions of the Kv1.2 channel: voltage sensing and gating. Voltage-gated potassium\ncGMP-induced current activation. Just like the Kv1.2 channels, distinct molecular determinants underlied the PIP(2) dual effects on SpIH, with the proximal C-terminus implicated in the inhibitory effect. The dual regulation of these very different ion channels, all of which are voltage-dependent, points to conserved mechanisms of regulation of these channels by PIP(2). Impact of ancillary subunits on ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels generate the outward K(+) ion currents that constitute the primary force in ventricular repolarization. Voltage-gated potassium channels comprise tetramers of pore-forming alpha subunits and, in probably most cases in vivo, ancillary or beta subunits that help define the properties of the Kv current generated. Ancillary subunits can be broadly categorized as cytoplasmic or transmembrane and can modify Kv channel trafficking, conductance, gating, ion selectivity, regulation, and pharmacology. Because of their often profound effects on Kv channel function, studies of the molecular correlates of ventricular repolarization must take\nnovel mutation in the shaker type voltage-gated potassium channel KCNA2 (CCDS_827.1: c.765_773del; p.255_257del). A rare missense SCN2A (rs200884216) variant was also found in 2 affected siblings and their unaffected mother. The p.255_257del mutation caused dominant negative loss of channel function. Molecular modeling predicted repositioning of critical arginine residues in the voltage-sensing domain. KCNA2 sequencing revealed 1 de novo mutation (CCDS_827.1: c.890G>A; p.Arg297Gln) in a girl with EE, ataxia, and tremor.CONCLUSIONS: A KCNA2 mutation caused dominantly inherited episodic ataxia, mild infantile-onset seizures, and later generalized and focal epilepsies in the setting of normal intellect. This observation expands the KCNA2 phenotypic spectrum from EE often associated with chronic ataxia, reflecting the marked variation in severity observed in many ion channel disorders. Dual Regulation of Voltage-Sensitive Ion Channels by PIP(2). Over the past 16 years, there has been an impressive number of ion channels shown to be sensitive to the major phosphoinositide in\nthe S1 segment of the voltage sensor in one subunit and both the S5 segment and top of the pore helix from another subunit. This interface evidently plays an important role in channel gating. Controlling potassium channel activities: Interplay between the membrane and intracellular factors. Neural signaling is based on the regulated timing and extent of channel opening; therefore, it is important to understand how ion channels open and close in response to neurotransmitters and intracellular messengers. Here, we examine this question for potassium channels, an extraordinarily diverse group of ion channels. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels control action-potential waveforms and neuronal firing patterns by opening and closing in response to membrane-potential changes. These effects can be strongly modulated by cytoplasmic factors such as kinases, phosphatases, and small GTPases. A Kv alpha subunit contains six transmembrane segments, including an intrinsic voltage sensor. In contrast, inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels have just\nand design of specific current-targeted compounds. Here, we discuss current thinking and lines of experimentation aimed at resolving the complexities of the Kv channel complexes that repolarize the human ventricular myocardium. Structural models for the KCNQ1 voltage-gated potassium channel. Mutations in the human voltage-gated potassium channel KCNQ1 are associated with predisposition to deafness and various cardiac arrhythmia syndromes including congenital long QT syndrome, familial atrial fibrillation, and sudden infant death syndrome. In this work 3-D structural models were developed for both the open and closed states of human KCNQ1 to facilitate structurally based hypotheses regarding mutation-phenotype relationships. The KCNQ1 open state was modeled using Rosetta in conjunction with Molecular Operating Environment software, and is based primarily on the recently determined open state structure of rat Kv1.2 (Long, S. B., et al. (2005) Science 309, 897-903). The closed state model for KCNQ1 was developed based on the crystal structures of bacterial\nKv1.1 subunits coassemble to form a novel channel with distinct gating properties that are altered profoundly by EA-1 mutations, thus uncovering novel physiopathogenetic mechanisms of episodic ataxia type-1 myokymia syndrome. Tracking the motion of the KV1.2 voltage sensor reveals the molecular perturbations caused by a de novo mutation in a case of epilepsy. KEY POINTS: KV1.2 channels, encoded by the KCNA2 gene, regulate neuronal excitability by conducting K+ upon depolarization. A new KCNA2 missense variant was discovered in a patient with epilepsy, causing amino acid substitution F302L at helix S4, in the KV1.2 voltage-sensing domain. Immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry showed that F302L does not impair KCNA2 subunit surface trafficking. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that F302L alters the exposure of S4 residues to membrane lipids. Voltage clamp fluorometry revealed that the voltage-sensing domain of KV1.2-F302L channels is more sensitive to depolarization. Accordingly, KV1.2-F302L channels opened faster and at more negative potentials;\nKv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels in developmental perspective. Kv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels consist of two types of \u03b1-subunits: (a) electrically-active Kcnb1 \u03b1-subunits and (b) silent or modulatory \u03b1-subunits plus \u03b2-subunits that, similar to silent \u03b1-subunits, also regulate electrically-active subunits. Voltage-gated potassium channels were traditionally viewed, mainly by electrophysiologists, as regulators of the electrical activity of the plasma membrane in excitable cells, a role that is performed by transmembrane protein domains of \u03b1-subunits that form the electric pore. Genetic studies revealed a role for this region of \u03b1-subunits of voltage-gated potassium channels in human neurodevelopmental disorders, such as epileptic encephalopathy. The N- and C-terminal domains of \u03b1-subunits interact to form the cytoplasmic subunit of heterotetrameric potassium channels that regulate electric pores. Subsequent animal studies revealed the developmental functions of Kcnb1-containing voltage-gated potassium channels and illustrated their role during brain development and reproduction. These functions of potassium channels are discussed in this review\ncorrelates with the mild end of the clinical spectrum reported in patients with GoF/LoF defects. The response to 4-AP corroborates existing evidence that KCNA2-disorders could benefit from variant-tailored therapeutic approaches, based on functional studies. An epilepsy-associated KV1.2 charge-transfer-center mutation impairs KV1.2 and KV1.4 trafficking. We report on a heterozygous KCNA2 variant in a child with epilepsy. KCNA2 encodes KV1.2 subunits, which form homotetrameric potassium channels and participate in heterotetrameric channel complexes with other KV1-family subunits, regulating neuronal excitability. The mutation causes substitution F233S at the KV1.2 charge transfer center of the voltage-sensing domain. Immunocytochemical trafficking assays showed that KV1.2(F233S) subunits are trafficking deficient and reduce the surface expression of wild-type KV1.2 and KV1.4: a dominant-negative phenotype extending beyond KCNA2, likely profoundly perturbing electrical signaling. Yet some KV1.2(F233S) trafficking was rescued by wild-type KV1.2 and KV1.4 subunits, likely in permissible heterotetrameric stoichiometries: electrophysiological studies utilizing applied transcriptomics and concatemer constructs support\ncauses episodic ataxia and pharmacoresponsive epilepsy. OBJECTIVE: To identify the genetic basis of a family segregating episodic ataxia, infantile seizures, and heterogeneous epilepsies and to study the phenotypic spectrum of KCNA2 mutations.METHODS: A family with 7 affected individuals over 3 generations underwent detailed phenotyping. Whole genome sequencing was performed on a mildly affected grandmother and her grandson with epileptic encephalopathy (EE). Segregating variants were filtered and prioritized based on functional annotations. The effects of the mutation on channel function were analyzed in vitro by voltage clamp assay and in silico by molecular modeling. KCNA2 was sequenced in 35 probands with heterogeneous phenotypes.RESULTS: The 7 family members had episodic ataxia (5), self-limited infantile seizures (5), evolving to genetic generalized epilepsy (4), focal seizures (2), and EE (1). They had a segregating novel mutation in the shaker type voltage-gated potassium channel KCNA2 (CCDS_827.1: c.765_773del; p.255_257del). A rare missense SCN2A (rs200884216) variant was",

Enzymatic reduction in surface poly-N-acetyllactosamine (polyLacNAc) glycans in HL60 cells reduced cell surface binding by Gal-8C but did not alter Gal-8N binding. Cross-linking and light scattering studies showed that Gal-8 is dimeric, and studies on individual subunits indicate that dimerization occurs through the Gal-8N domain. Mutations of individual domains within full-length Gal-8 showed that signaling activity toward HL60 cells resides in the C-terminal domain. In glycan microarray analyses, each CRD of Gal-8 showed different binding, with Gal-8N recognizing sulfated and sialylated glycans and Gal-8C recognizing blood group antigens and polyLacNAc glycans. These results demonstrate that Gal-8 dimerization promotes functional bivalency of each CRD, which allows Gal-8 to signal PS exposure in leukocytes entirely through C-terminal domain recognition of polyLacNAc glycans. Beta-phenylethylamine alters monoamine transporter function via trace amine-associated receptor 1: implication for modulatory roles of trace amines in brain.\nglycans. Beta-phenylethylamine alters monoamine transporter function via trace amine-associated receptor 1: implication for modulatory roles of trace amines in brain. Brain monoamines include common biogenic amines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin) and trace amines [beta-phenylethylamine (beta-PEA), tyramine, tryptamine, and octopamine]. Common biogenic amines are well established as neurotransmitters, but the roles and functional importance of trace amines remain elusive. Here, we re-evaluated the interaction of trace amines with trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and investigated effects of beta-PEA on monoamine transporter function and influence of monoamine autoreceptors on TAAR1 signaling. We confirmed that TAAR1 was activated by trace amines and demonstrated that TAAR1 activation by beta-PEA significantly inhibited uptake and induced efflux of [3H]dopamine, [3H]norepinephrine, and [3H]serotonin in transfected cells. In brain synaptosomes, beta-PEA significantly inhibited uptake and induced efflux of [3H]dopamine and [3H]serotonin in striatal and [3H]norepinephrine in thalamic synaptosomes of rhesus monkeys and wild-type mice, but it lacked the\nwith 8C and 8D, and colocalized with 8D at the plasma membrane and in vesicles. We compared VRAC currents mediated by homomeric and heteromeric LRRC8C and LRRC8D channels expressed in HEK293 cells. The oxidant chloramine T (ChlorT, 1 mM) weakly inhibited 8C, but potently inhibited 8D currents. ChlorT exposure also impaired subsequent current block by the VRAC blocker DCPIB, implicating external sites of oxidation. Substitution of the 8D extracellular loop domains (EL1, EL2) into 8C conferred significantly stronger ChlorT-mediated inhibition of 8C currents. Our results suggest that LRRC8A/C channel activity can be effectively maintained in the oxidized microenvironment expected to result from Nox1 activation at the plasma membrane. Increased ratios of 8D:8C expression may potentially depress inflammatory responses to TNF\u03b1. LRRC8A/C channel downregulation represents a novel strategy to reduce TNF\u03b1-induced inflammation. FGF-8 isoforms activate receptor splice forms that are expressed in mesenchymal regions of mouse development. The Fgf8 gene is\nfibroblast growth factor receptor 4. Recombinant FGF-8b and FGF-8c activate the 'c' splice form of FGFR3, and FGFR4, while FGF-8b also efficiently activates 'c' splice form of FGFR2. No activity could be detected for recombinant or cell expressed FGF-8a. Furthermore, none of the isoforms tested interact efficiently with 'b' splice forms of FGFR1-3, or the 'c' splice form of FGFR1. These results indicate that the FGF-8b and FGF-8c isoforms, produced by ectodermally derived epithelial cells, interact with mesenchymally expressed fibroblast growth factor receptors. FGF-8b and FGF-8c may therefore provide a mitogenic signal to the underlying mesenchyme during limb and craniofacial development.\ninflammation. FGF-8 isoforms activate receptor splice forms that are expressed in mesenchymal regions of mouse development. The Fgf8 gene is expressed in developing limb and craniofacial structures, regions known to be important for growth and patterning of the mouse embryo. Although Fgf8 is alternatively spliced to generate at least 7 secreted isoforms that differ only at their mature amino terminus, the biological significance of these multiple isoforms is not known. In this report, we demonstrate that multiple FGF-8 isoforms are present at sites of Fgf8 expression during mouse development. To address the possibility that the FGF-8 isoforms might interact with different fibroblast growth factor receptors, we prepared recombinant FGF-8 protein isoforms. We examined the ability of these proteins to activate alternatively spliced forms of fibroblast growth factor receptors 1-3, and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4. Recombinant FGF-8b and FGF-8c activate the 'c' splice form of FGFR3, and FGFR4, while FGF-8b\nmost effectively sustain Nox1 activity at the plasma membrane. This may result from their ability to remain active in an oxidized microenvironment.ABSTRACT: Tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) activates NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), producing superoxide (O2\u2022- ) required for subsequent signalling. LRRC8 family proteins A-E comprise volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs). The required subunit LRRC8A physically associates with Nox1, and VRAC activity is required for Nox activity and the inflammatory response to TNF\u03b1. VRAC currents are modulated by oxidants, suggesting that channel oxidant sensitivity and proximity to Nox1 may play a physiologically relevant role. In VSMCs, LRRC8C knockdown (siRNA) recapitulated the effects of siLRRC8A, inhibiting TNF\u03b1-induced extracellular and endosomal O2\u2022- production, receptor endocytosis, nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation and proliferation. In contrast, siLRRC8D potentiated NF-\u03baB activation. Nox1 co-immunoprecipitated with 8C and 8D, and colocalized with 8D at the plasma membrane and in vesicles. We compared VRAC currents mediated\n1. KEY POINTS: LRRC8A-containing anion channels associate with NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) and regulate superoxide production and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) signalling. Here we show that LRRC8C and 8D also co-immunoprecipitate with Nox1 in vascular smooth muscle cells. LRRC8C knockdown inhibited TNF\u03b1-induced O2\u2022- production, receptor endocytosis, nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation and proliferation while LRRC8D knockdown enhanced NF-\u03baB activation. Significant changes in LRRC8 isoform expression in human atherosclerosis and psoriasis suggest compensation for increased inflammation. The oxidant chloramine-T (ChlorT, 1 mM) weakly (\u223c25%) inhibited LRRC8C currents but potently (\u223c80%) inhibited LRRC8D currents. Substitution of the extracellular loop (EL1, EL2) domains of 8D into 8C conferred significantly stronger (69%) ChlorT-dependent inhibition. ChlorT exposure impaired subsequent current block by DCPIB, which occurs through interaction with EL1, further implicating external oxidation sites. LRRC8A/C channels most effectively sustain Nox1 activity at the plasma membrane. This may result from their ability to remain active in an\nDimeric Galectin-8 induces phosphatidylserine exposure in leukocytes through polylactosamine recognition by the C-terminal domain. Human galectins have distinct and overlapping biological roles in immunological homeostasis. However, the underlying differences among galectins in glycan binding specificity regulating these functions are unclear. Galectin-8 (Gal-8), a tandem repeat galectin, has two distinct carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) that may cross-link cell surface counter receptors. Here we report that each Gal-8 CRD has differential glycan binding specificity and that cell signaling activity resides in the C-terminal CRD. Full-length Gal-8 and recombinant individual domains (Gal-8N and Gal-8C) bound to human HL60 cells, but only full-length Gal-8 signaled phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure in cells, which occurred independently of apoptosis. Although desialylation of cells did not alter Gal-8 binding, it enhanced cellular sensitivity to Gal-8-induced PS exposure. By contrast, HL60 cell desialylation increased binding by Gal-8C but reduced Gal-8N binding. Enzymatic reduction in surface poly-N-acetyllactosamine (polyLacNAc) glycans in HL60\n[3H]dopamine and [3H]serotonin in striatal and [3H]norepinephrine in thalamic synaptosomes of rhesus monkeys and wild-type mice, but it lacked the same effects in synaptosomes of TAAR1 knockout mice. The effect of beta-PEA on efflux was blocked by transporter inhibitors in either the transfected cells or wild-type mouse synaptosomes. We also demonstrated that TAAR1 signaling was not affected by monoamine autoreceptors at exposure to trace amines that we show to have poor binding affinity for the autoreceptors relative to common biogenic amines. These results reveal that beta-PEA alters monoamine transporter function via interacting with TAAR1 but not monoamine autoreceptors. The functional profile of beta-PEA may reveal a common mechanism by which trace amines exert modulatory effects on monoamine transporters in brain. Oxidant-resistant LRRC8A/C anion channels support superoxide production by NADPH oxidase 1.

Our data suggest that, in addition to plakoglobin, p0071 is the second armadillo protein present in both types of adhesive junctions and may play a role in regulating crosstalk between adherens junctions and desmosomes. The complex of Fas-associated factor 1 with Hsp70 stabilizes the adherens junction integrity by suppressing RhoA activation. Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1) is a scaffolding protein that plays multiple functions, and dysregulation of FAF1 is associated with many types of diseases such as cancers. FAF1 contains multiple ubiquitin-related domains (UBA, UBL1, UBL2, UAS, and UBX), each domain interacting with a specific partner. In particular, the interaction of UBL1 with heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is associated with tumor formation, although the molecular understanding remains unknown. In this study, the structural analysis revealed that His160 of FAF1 is important for its interaction with Hsp70. The association of\nluminal cells. While shrew-1 localization remained unaltered in myoepithelial cells, nuclear localization occurred in luminal cells during lactation. Based on these observations, we identified two unknown shrew-1 transcript variants encoding N-terminally truncated proteins. The smallest shrew-1 protein lacks the extracellular domain and is most likely the only variant present in luminal cells. RNA analyses of human tissues confirmed that the novel transcript variants of shrew-1 exist in vivo and exhibit a differential tissue expression profile. We conclude that our findings are essential for the understanding and interpretation of future functional and interactome analyses of shrew-1 variants. Endogenous AJAP1 associates with the cytoskeleton and attenuates angiogenesis in endothelial cells. The adherens junction associated protein 1 (AJAP1, aka shrew-1) is presumably a type-I transmembrane protein localizing and interacting with the E-cadherin-catenin complex. In various tumors, AJAP1 expression is reduced or lost, including hepatocellular and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and glial-derived tumors. The\nresults suggest that the downregulation of AJAP1 protein expression may play a certain role in progression and metastasis of SACC. Our study indicates that AJAP1 may be a potential prognostic molecular marker and therapeutic target for SACC. Targeting of p0071 to desmosomes and adherens junctions is mediated by different protein domains. p0071, a member of the armadillo protein family, is most closely related to p120(ctn) and the plakophilins 1-3. Whereas plakophilins are desmosomal plaque proteins, p120(ctn) localizes to adherens junctions and interacts with classical cadherins. In contrast, p0071 has been described as a protein with dual localization in adherens junctions and desmosomes depending on the cell type examined. Here we have analyzed the localization of p0071 and its domains in detail. Although by sequence analysis, p0071 is more closely related to the adherens junction proteins p120(ctn), ARVCF and delta-catenin, endogenous p0071 associated preferentially with desmosomes in MCF-7 epithelial cells. Overexpressed\nthis study, the structural analysis revealed that His160 of FAF1 is important for its interaction with Hsp70. The association of Hsp70 with FAF1 is required for the interaction with IQGAP1. FAF1 negatively regulates RhoA activation by FAF1-Hsp70 complex formation, which then interacts with IQGAP1. These steps play a key role in maintaining the stability of cell-to-cell junction. We conclude that FAF1 plays a critical role in the structure and function of adherens junction during tissue homeostasis and morphogenesis by suppressing RhoA activation, which induces the activation of Rho-associated protein kinase, phosphorylation of myosin light chain, formation of actin stress fiber, and disruption of adherens junction. In addition, depletion of FAF1 increased collective invasion in a 3D spheroid cell culture. These results provide insight into how the FAF1-Hsp70 complex acts as a novel regulator of the adherens junction integrity. The complex can be a potential therapeutic target to inhibit tumorigenesis and\nassociation of core proteins, such as E-cadherin, with membrane rafts. We here show that the cadherin proteins of the adherens junction associate with flotillin-2 in MCF10A cells and in various human cell lines. In vitro, flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 directly interact with \u03b3-catenin which is so far the only protein known to be present both in the adherens junction and the desmosome. Mapping of the interaction domain within the \u03b3-catenin sequence identified the Armadillo domains 6-8, especially ARM domain 7, to be important for the association with flotillins. Furthermore, depletion of flotillins significantly influenced the morphology of the adherens junction in human epithelial MCF10A cells and altered the association of E-cadherin and \u03b3-catenin with membrane rafts. Taken together, these observations suggest a functional role for flotillins, especially flotillin-2, in cell-cell adhesion in non-malignant epithelial cells.\ncases, also ZO-2/3) was reported to be directly associated with claudins, occludin, and JAMs, as well as with AF-6/afadin and alpha-catenin. Here we summarize recent studies on ZO-1/2/3-deficiency in mice and cells, which have provided clear and important information regarding the functions of ZO-1/2/3 in vivo. In addition to the respective suppression of ZO-1/2/3 expression, simultaneous suppression of all three proteins has revealed the essential and nonessential in vivo roles of ZO-1/2 and ZO-3, respectively. ZO-3 shows an epithelial-specific TJ localization in a ZO-1/2-dependent fashion. ZO-1 and ZO-2 play pivotal roles in the final establishment of the belt-like adherens junctions (zonula adherens), followed by the formation of the belt-like TJs (zonula occludens) with paracellular barrier function, thereby providing the general basis for selective paracellular permeability in epithelial and endothelial cells. Modular composition and dynamics of native GABAB receptors identified by high-resolution proteomics. GABAB receptors, the most abundant inhibitory G protein-coupled\na novel regulator of the adherens junction integrity. The complex can be a potential therapeutic target to inhibit tumorigenesis and metastasis. Flotillins directly interact with \u03b3-catenin and regulate epithelial cell-cell adhesion. Flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 are two homologous, membrane raft associated proteins. Although it has been reported that flotillins are involved in cell adhesion processes and play a role during breast cancer progression, thus making them interesting future therapeutic targets, their precise function has not been well elucidated. The present study investigates the function of these proteins in cell-cell adhesion in non-malignant cells. We have used the non-malignant epithelial MCF10A cells to study the interaction network of flotillins within cell-cell adhesion complexes. RNA interference was used to examine the effect of flotillins on the structure of adherens junctions and on the association of core proteins, such as E-cadherin, with membrane rafts. We here show that the cadherin proteins of the adherens\nand targets in clinical research.Methods: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot (WB) were performed to detect the expression of Adherens Junctions Associated Protein 1 (AJAP1). Methylation-specific PCR was used to evaluate the methylation of the AJAP1 promoter. AJAP1 was overexpressed or knocked down by lentivirus-mediated transfection. Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to create a survival curve and the log-rank test was used to analyze the overall survival (OS). The prognostic correlation was assessed using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) was utilized to pull down the possible binding protein of AJAP1 and laser scanning confocal microscopy was applied to detect the subcellular localization of AJAP1, E-cadherin, and \u03b2-catenin. Cell viability, colony formation, wound healing, and Transwell invasion assays were performed to evaluate the function of AJAP1 in vitro. A subcutaneous xenograft assay in nude mice was performed to verify the function of AJAP1 in vivo.Results: AJAP1\nRoles of ZO-1 and ZO-2 in establishment of the belt-like adherens and tight junctions with paracellular permselective barrier function. Tight junctions (TJs) create the primary permselective barrier to diffusion of solutes and ions through the paracellular pathway. The molecular architecture of TJs has gradually been unraveled in recent years, providing the basis for \"barriology\" (defined by Shoichiro Tsukita as the science of the barrier in multicellular organisms). Claudins are now considered to be the essential basic components of TJ strands, with which other integral membrane proteins, such as occludin, tricellulin, JAMs, and CAR, are associated. Peripherally associated scaffolding proteins are required for the organization of the integral membrane proteins. Among these, ZO-1, -2, and -3 have attracted a great deal of attention as TJ organizers, since ZO-1 (and in some cases, also ZO-2/3) was reported to be directly associated with claudins, occludin, and JAMs, as well as with AF-6/afadin and\ndiagnostic marker. Neuropilin-1 interacts with VE-cadherin and TGFBR2 to stabilize adherens junctions and prevent activation of endothelium under flow. Linear and disturbed flow differentially regulate gene expression, with disturbed flow priming endothelial cells (ECs) for a proinflammatory, atheroprone expression profile and phenotype. Here, we investigated the role of the transmembrane protein neuropilin-1 (NRP1) in ECs exposed to flow using cultured ECs, mice with an endothelium-specific knockout of NRP1, and a mouse model of atherosclerosis. We demonstrated that NRP1 was a constituent of adherens junctions that interacted with VE-cadherin and promoted its association with p120 catenin, stabilizing adherens junctions and inducing cytoskeletal remodeling in alignment with the direction of flow. We also showed that NRP1 interacted with transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) receptor II (TGFBR2) and reduced the plasma membrane localization of TGFBR2 and TGF-\u03b2 signaling. NRP1 knockdown increased the abundance of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules, resulting in increased leukocyte rolling\nto the adherens junction proteins p120(ctn), ARVCF and delta-catenin, endogenous p0071 associated preferentially with desmosomes in MCF-7 epithelial cells. Overexpressed p0071 localized along cell borders and overlapped only partially with desmosomal markers but colocalized with non-desmosomal cadherins and recruited cadherins to the membrane. The head domain of p0071 was sufficient for desmosomal targeting, whereas the arm repeat domain associated with adherens junctions and enhanced membrane association of classical cadherins. The tail domain localized preferentially to the nucleus and associated with desmosomes. To examine the mechanism underlying this dual localization more closely we determined binding partners of p0071 by using yeast-two-hybrid and mom-targeting assays. These approaches show that the head domain interacted with desmosomal proteins desmocollin 3a and desmoplakin, whereas the armadillo repeat domain binds to non-desmosomal cadherins. Head and armadillo repeat domains both interacted with plakoglobin by binding to different sites. Our data suggest that, in addition to plakoglobin, p0071\nthe sushi domains of GABAB1a. Our results unravel the molecular diversity of GABAB receptors and their postnatal assembly dynamics and provide a roadmap for studying the cellular signaling of this inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor. Alternative exon usage creates novel transcript variants of tumor suppressor SHREW-1 gene with differential tissue expression profile. Shrew-1, also called AJAP1, is a transmembrane protein associated with E-cadherin-mediated adherence junctions and a putative tumor suppressor. Apart from its interaction with \u03b2-catenin and involvement in E-cadherin internalization, little structure or function information exists. Here we explored shrew-1 expression during postnatal differentiation of mammary gland as a model system. Immunohistological analyses with antibodies against either the extracellular or the cytoplasmic domains of shrew-1 consistently revealed the expression of full-length shrew-1 in myoepithelial cells, but only part of it in luminal cells. While shrew-1 localization remained unaltered in myoepithelial cells, nuclear localization occurred in luminal cells during lactation. Based on\nIn various tumors, AJAP1 expression is reduced or lost, including hepatocellular and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and glial-derived tumors. The aberrant expression of AJAP1 is associated with alterations in cell migration, invasion, increased tumor growth, and tumor vascularization, suggesting AJAP1 as a putative tumor suppressor. We show that AJAP1 attenuates sprouting angiogenesis by reducing endothelial migration and invasion capacities. Further, we show for the first time that endogenous AJAP1 is associated with the microtubule cytoskeleton. This linkage is independent from cell confluency and stable during angiogenic sprouting in vitro Our work suggests that AJAP1 is a putative negative regulator of angiogenesis, reducing cell migration and invasion by interfering with the microtubule network. Based on our results and those of other authors, we suggest AJAP1 as a novel tumor suppressor and diagnostic marker.

NRP1 knockdown increased the abundance of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules, resulting in increased leukocyte rolling and atherosclerotic plaque size. These findings describe a role for NRP1 in promoting endothelial function and reveal a mechanism by which NRP1 reduction in ECs may contribute to vascular disease by modulating adherens junction signaling and promoting TGF-\u03b2 signaling and inflammation. Silencing of AJAP1 expression by promoter methylation activates the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway to promote tumor proliferation and metastasis in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma. Background: Salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC) is a unique malignant tumor of the salivary gland with poor prognosis, which is not effective with chemotherapy and targeted drugs. Therefore, it is important to explore the molecular mechanism underlying SACC invasion and metastasis to develop novel therapeutic strategies and targets in clinical research.Methods: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot (WB) were performed to detect the\nModular composition and dynamics of native GABAB receptors identified by high-resolution proteomics. GABAB receptors, the most abundant inhibitory G protein-coupled receptors in the mammalian brain, display pronounced diversity in functional properties, cellular signaling and subcellular distribution. We used high-resolution functional proteomics to identify the building blocks of these receptors in the rodent brain. Our analyses revealed that native GABAB receptors are macromolecular complexes with defined architecture, but marked diversity in subunit composition: the receptor core is assembled from GABAB1a/b, GABAB2, four KCTD proteins and a distinct set of G-protein subunits, whereas the receptor's periphery is mostly formed by transmembrane proteins of different classes. In particular, the periphery-forming constituents include signaling effectors, such as Cav2 and HCN channels, and the proteins AJAP1 and amyloid-\u03b2 A4, both of which tightly associate with the sushi domains of GABAB1a. Our results unravel the molecular diversity of GABAB receptors and their postnatal assembly dynamics and\nin vitro. A subcutaneous xenograft assay in nude mice was performed to verify the function of AJAP1 in vivo.Results: AJAP1 was downregulated in SACC tumors and was closely related to SACC lymph node/distant metastasis, which was an independent risk factor for SACC prognosis. Methylation-specific PCR confirmed that high methylation of the AJAP1 promoter was the main cause of its silencing. Overexpression or knockdown of AJAP1 in SACC cells could significantly inhibit or promote the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of SACC cells, respectively, in both the in vitro and in vivo experiments. Mechanically, we found that AJAP1 binds to E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin to form a complex in cytomembrane, reducing the nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin and blocking the Wingless/Integrated/\u03b2-catenin (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin) signaling pathway to play a suppressive role in cancer.Conclusions: In conclusion, these results suggest that the downregulation of AJAP1 protein expression may play a certain role in progression and metastasis of SACC.",

Consistent with previous MS analysis, a significant amount of 2 is present in the \u0394dph7 eEF-2 sample without Dph7, possibly due to nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the methyl ester (4a) during incubation in pH 8.0 buffer and during the sample preparation process for MS analysis. Dph7 hydrolyzes methylated diphthine to form diphthine. Relative intensities of tryptic peptides from \u0394dph7 eEF-2 with (\u201c+Dph7\u201d) or without Dph7 (\u201c\u2013Dph7\u201d) treatment were shown. Intensities of tryptic peptides from \u0394dph7 eEF-2 without Dph7 treatment were set to 1. Our finding that Dph7 is a methylesterase converting methylated diphthine (4a) to diphthine (2) suggests that the diphthamide biosynthesis pathway needs to be revised. In the current literature, 2 is proposed as the product of the second step catalyzed by the methyltransferase, Dph5. It was proposed after the fact that acid hydrolysis of eEF-2 with in vitro reconstitution of the second step yields 2. However, under\ntruncation mutants are sensitive to overexpression of DPH5, the gene necessary to synthesize diphthine from the first diphthamide pathway intermediate produced by Dph1-Dph3. This is in stark contrast to dph6 mutants, which also lack the ability to form diphthamide but are resistant to growth inhibition by excess Dph5 levels. As judged from site-specific mutagenesis, the amidation reaction itself relies on a conserved ATP binding domain in Dph6 that, when altered, blocks diphthamide formation and confers resistance to eEF2 inhibition by sordarin. QM/MM Studies of Dph5 - A Promiscuous Methyltransferase in the Eukaryotic Biosynthetic Pathway of Diphthamide. Eukaryotic diphthine synthase, Dph5, is a promiscuous methyltransferase that catalyzes an extraordinary N, O-tetramethylation of 2-(3-carboxy-3-aminopropyl)-l-histidine (ACP) to yield diphthine methyl ester (DTM). These are intermediates in the biosynthesis of the post-translationally modified histidine residue diphthamide (DTA), a unique and essential residue part of the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2). Herein, the promiscuity of\n\u0394dph7 eEF2. Lane 1: flag-tagged \u0394dph7 eEF-2 incubated without Dph7. Lane 2: flag-tagged \u0394dph7 eEF-2 incubated with Dph7 and then purified to remove Dph7. Both \u0394dph7 eEF-2 samples were then incubated with Dph6 and labeled with DT and Rh-NAD. To test the hypothesis that methylated diphthine (4a or 4b) is a methyl ester (4a), we examined the nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the methyl ester under mild basic conditions. Purified \u0394dph7 eEF-2 in Tris-HCl pH 9.0 buffer was incubated at 30 \u00b0C for various time intervals. The conversion of 4a to 2 was monitored by the amidation reaction, as Dph6 selectively amidates 2, but not 4a, to form diphthamide (1). The formation of 1 is then detected by a fluorescence label using Rh-NAD and DT. As shown in Figure 3A, an increased incubation time for \u0394dph7 eEF-2 leads to an increased fluorescence label, indicating the time-dependent conversion of 4a to 2. In\nthat 4a is the product of the second step in diphthamide biosynthesis and Dph5 is responsible for the extra methylation. Dph5 generates methylated diphthine. Relative intensities of tryptic peptides from \u0394dph5 eEF-2 with (\u201c+Dph5\u201d) or without Dph5 (\u201c\u2013Dph5\u201d) treatment were shown. Intensities of tryptic peptides from \u0394dph5 eEF-2 with Dph5 treatment were set to 1. In summary, our results presented here demonstrate that there is a previously unidentified step in the diphthamide biosynthesis pathway, and we propose a revised scheme of the diphthamide biosynthesis pathway (Scheme 1B). Yeast Dph5 catalyzes the methylation of the amino and the carboxylate groups of ACP, generating methylated diphthine (4a). The molecular function of Dph7 is to convert methylated diphthine (4a) to diphthine (2) so that Dph6 can convert it to diphthamide (1). Although a considerable amount of 2 was observed in both the MS studies of \u0394dph7 eEF-2 and \u0394dph5 eEF-2 treated with Dph5,\na novel methylated diphthamide (3, Figure 1) was recently reported in a lymphoma cell line with Dph7 gene deletion. This methylation was thought to occur on one of the nitrogen atoms of the imidazole ring of the histidine residue (3, Figure 1). Here we demonstrate that this modification is actually methylated diphthine with the methyl group on the carboxylate of diphthine (4a, Figure 1) and Dph7 is a methylesterase responsible for the hydrolysis of the methylated diphthine (4a) to generate diphthine (2), which can then be used by Dph6 in the last amidation step (Scheme 1B). Methylated diphthine (4a) is produced by the enzymatic function of Dph5. The present work thus uncovers the molecular function of Dph7 and provides a revised diphthamide biosynthesis pathway (Scheme 1B). Proposed structures of methylated diphthamide and methylated diphthine. Under the acidic conditions of mass spectrometry analysis, the carboxylic group of 4b is protonated. To\nspecies was methylated diphthine instead (4a or 4b, Figure 1). In light of this report, we investigated the presence of methylated diphthine (4a or 4b) in \u0394dph7 eEF-2 and \u0394dph6 eEF-2 via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) studies. Consistent with previous studies, we found diphthine (2) containing tryptic peptide (686-VNILDVTLHADAIHR-700) from both \u0394dph7 and \u0394dph6 eEF-2 samples (Figure S1A). Likewise, we observed a small amount of unmodified peptides, but no diphthamide (1) was detected in either eEF-2 sample. We also found the presence of methylated diphthine (4a or 4b) in \u0394dph7 eEF-2 (Figure S1B). Most strikingly, this methylated diphthine (4a or 4b) was not detected in \u0394dph6 eEF-2. This unexpected form of modification had an m/z larger than those of all the previously known intermediates of diphthamide biosynthesis or diphthamide (1). The results of this investigation suggested a possible enzymatic role for Dph7 as a demethylase. We hypothesized that Dph7 functions\ndiphthamide (Figure 2B, lane 1). Taken together, these findings indicate that there is an additional step before the last amidation step in the diphthamide biosynthesis and Dph7 is the enzyme catalyzing this step. The conclusion of Dph7 having enzymatic function is seemingly contradictory to previous reports showing that \u0394dph6 eEF-2 and \u0394dph7 eEF-2 both contain diphthine (2). Based on these observations, there is no room for any apparent chemical transformation for Dph7\u2019s enzymatic activity. Interestingly, a species with a mass of 15 Da larger than that of diphthamide (1) was reported in a lymphoma cell line with Dph7 gene deletion. The proposed structure for this species was methylated diphthamide (3, Figure 1). However, the expected mass difference of 3 and 1 is 14 Da. Therefore, we speculated that the observed species was methylated diphthine instead (4a or 4b, Figure 1). In light of this report, we investigated the presence of\nThe results of this investigation suggested a possible enzymatic role for Dph7 as a demethylase. We hypothesized that Dph7 functions to remove the extra methyl group on methylated diphthine (4a or 4b) to form diphthine (2). Furthermore, the fact that 2 was also observed in MS studies of \u0394dph7 eEF-2 suggested that this methyl group was relatively labile during the sample preparation for MS. Therefore, we proposed that methylated diphthine is a methyl ester which is prone to hydrolysis (4a, Scheme 1B). Dph7 converts \u0394dph7 eEF2 to a substrate for amidation by Dph6. (A) Dph6 and Dph7 are both required for in vitro amidation of \u0394dph7 eEF2. The fluorescence labels indicate formation of diphthamide by the amidation reaction catalyzed by Dph6. (B) Stepwise in vitro reconstitution of diphthamide formation on \u0394dph7 eEF2. Lane 1: flag-tagged \u0394dph7 eEF-2 incubated without Dph7. Lane 2: flag-tagged \u0394dph7 eEF-2 incubated with Dph7 and then\nsingle methyltransferase, Dph5, which catalyzes the trimethylation of the amino group to form the diphthine intermediate (2, Scheme 1A). The last step is the amidation of the carboxyl group of diphthine (2) to form diphthamide (1), but the proteins required for this step evaded the initial genetic screening and remained elusive for a long time. Carette et al. identified human WDR85 (yeast YBR246W) as a new diphthamide biosynthetic protein (later named Dph7) through haploid genetic screening. It was initially proposed that Dph7 is involved in the first step of diphthamide biosynthesis, but a later study by our laboratory showed that deletion of Dph7 led to accumulation of 2, suggesting that Dph7 is involved in the last step of diphthamide biosynthesis. However, Dph7 is not the diphthamide synthetase, as it lacks the ATP-binding domain required. The actual diphthamide synthetase, Dph6, was identified independently by three groups using comparative genomic analysis, yeast\nDT and induce resistance against sordarin, an eEF2 poisoning antifungal. The latter phenotype applies to all diphthamide mutants (dph1-dph5) tested and Kti11/Dph3 physically interacts with diphthamide synthesis factors Dph1 and Dph2, presumably as part of a trimeric complex. Moreover, we present a separation of function mutation in KTI11, kti11-1, which dissociates zymocin resistance from DT sensitivity. It encodes a C-terminal Kti11 truncation that almost entirely abolishes Elongator interaction without affecting association with Kti13, another Kti11 partner protein. Structures of two archaeal diphthine synthases: insights into the post-translational modification of elongation factor 2. The target of diphtheria toxin is the diphthamide residue in translation elongation factor 2 (EF-2), which is generated by a three-step post-translational modification of a specific histidine residue in the EF-2 precursor. In the second modification step, an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase, diphthine synthase (DS), catalyzes the trimethylation of the EF-2 precursor. The homodimeric crystal structures of the archaeal diphthine\ninactivates eEF-2, which in turn stops translation, leading to cell death. Diphthamide is reported to be important for preventing \u22121 translational frame shift in yeast and mammalian cells. Intriguingly, this modification is not present in EF-G, the bacterial ortholog of eEF-2. Genetic and biochemical studies in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae allowed dissection of the diphthamide biosynthesis pathway. It was initially proposed that the biosynthesis involves three steps (Scheme 1A).\u2212 Four proteins, Dph1\u20134, are required for the first step, which involves the transfer of the 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl (ACP) group from S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to the C2 carbon of the imidazole ring of His699 of yeast eEF-2 (His715 of mammalian eEF-2). Recent evidence suggests that this step uses a unique [4Fe-4S]-containing enzyme and a radical reaction mechanism.\u2212 The second step involves a single methyltransferase, Dph5, which catalyzes the trimethylation of the amino group to form the diphthine intermediate (2, Scheme 1A). The\ndemonstrate that the Dph5-catalyzed reaction generates methylated diphthine, a previously overlooked intermediate, and Dph7 is a methylesterase that hydrolyzes methylated diphthine to produce diphthine and allows the Dph6-catalyzed amidation reaction to occur. Thus, our study characterizes the molecular function of Dph7 for the first time and provides a revised diphthamide biosynthesis pathway. Diphthamide is a post-translationally modified histidine residue present on archaeal and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF-2), a GTPase involved in the translocation of mRNA and tRNA on the ribosome during translation elongation.\u2212 This exceptional modification is targeted by the pathogenic bacterium, Corynebacterium diphtheria, which causes the infectious disease diphtheria in humans. Diphtheria toxin (DT) produced by this bacterium catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of the diphthamide residue of eEF-2 using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) as the ADP-ribosyl donor. Irreversible ADP-ribosylation inactivates eEF-2, which in turn stops translation, leading to cell death. Diphthamide is reported to be important for preventing \u22121\nin growth and development, and almost always die before birth. Those that survive long enough had preaxial polydactyly, a duplication of digit 1 of the hind foot. This same defect has been seen in embryos that were homozygous for mutation of DPH1, suggesting that lack of diphthamide on eEF2 could result in translational failure of specific proteins, rather than a generalized translation downregulation. Decoding the biosynthesis and function of diphthamide, an enigmatic modification of translation elongation factor 2 (EF2) Diphthamide is a highly conserved modification of archaeal and eukaryal translation elongation factor 2 (EF2) and yet why cells need EF2 to contain diphthamide is unclear. In yeast, the first steps of diphthamide synthesis and the genes (DPH1-DPH5) required to form the intermediate diphthine are well-documented. However, the last step, amidation of diphthine to diphthamide, had largely been ill-defined. Remarkably, through mining genome-wide synthetic gene array (SGA) and chemical genomics databases,\nS-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase, diphthine synthase (DS), catalyzes the trimethylation of the EF-2 precursor. The homodimeric crystal structures of the archaeal diphthine synthases from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 and Aeropyrum pernix K1 have been determined. These structures share essentially the same overall fold as the cobalt-precorrin-4 methyltransferase CbiF, confirming that DS belongs to the dimeric class III family of methyltransferases. In the P. horikoshii DS dimer, only one of the two active sites binds the reaction product S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy), while the other active site contains no ligand. This asymmetric AdoHcy binding may be a consequence of intra-domain and inter-domain movements upon binding of AdoHcy at one of the two sites. These movements disrupt the twofold dimeric symmetry of the DS dimer and probably cause lower AdoHcy affinity at the other binding site. Dph3 is an electron donor for Dph1-Dph2 in the first step of eukaryotic diphthamide biosynthesis. Diphthamide, the target of diphtheria toxin,\nhas a novel role as an EF2 inhibitor that affects cell growth when diphthamide synthesis is blocked or incomplete and, importantly, shows that diphthamide promotes the accuracy of EF2 performance during translation. Diphthamide-deficiency syndrome: a novel human developmental disorder and ribosomopathy We describe a novel type of ribosomopathy that is defined by deficiency in diphthamidylation of translation elongation factor 2. The ribosomopathy was identified by correlating phenotypes and biochemical properties of previously described patients with diphthamide biosynthesis gene 1 (DPH1) deficiencies with a new patient that carried inactivating mutations in both alleles of the human diphthamide biosynthesis gene 2 (DPH2). The human DPH1 syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with developmental delay, abnormal head circumference (microcephaly or macrocephaly), short stature, and congenital heart disease. It is defined by variants with reduced functionality of the DPH1 gene observed so far predominantly in consanguineous homozygous patients carrying identical mutant alleles of\nincubation time for \u0394dph7 eEF-2 leads to an increased fluorescence label, indicating the time-dependent conversion of 4a to 2. In contrast, extending the incubation time for \u0394dph6 eEF-2, which contains 2, has no effect on the fluorescence intensity (Figure 3B). Moreover, the labeling intensities of \u0394dph7 eEF-2 after incubation at pH 9.0 are considerably lower than those of \u0394dph6 eEF-2, suggesting incomplete conversion even after 4 h of incubation (Figure 3). This nonenzymatic reaction demonstrated that the extra methylation site is susceptible to hydrolysis. Thus, the most likely configuration of the methylated diphthine is a methyl ester (4a). Nonenzymatic hydrolysis of methylated diphthine to diphthine. (A) \u0394dph7 eEF-2 or (B) \u0394dph6 eEF-2 were buffer-exchanged into a buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.0 and 150 mM NaCl and incubated at 30 \u00b0C for various time intervals before the amidation reaction by Dph6. Formation of diphthamide was detected by a fluorescence\nimmediate substrate for the in vitro amidation by Dph6 (Figure 2A, lane 2). In contrast, eEF-2 from \u0394dph6 was a substrate for the in vitro reaction (Figure 2A, lane 1). Diphthamide was formed on \u0394dph7 eEF-2 only in the presence of both Dph6 and Dph7 (Figure 2A, lane 3). These results support the notion that Dph7 converts \u0394dph7 eEF-2 into \u0394dph6 eEF-2, a form of eEF-2 that can be amidated by Dph6 to generate diphthamide. To further demonstrate that Dph7 catalyzes an additional step, we incubated flag-tagged \u0394dph7 eEF-2 with Dph7 and repurified the \u0394dph7 eEF-2 to remove Dph7. We found that the repurified \u0394dph7 eEF-2 was a substrate for the amidation by Dph6 alone (Figure 2B, lane 2). In contrast, flag-tagged \u0394dph7 eEF-2 incubated without Dph7 did not form diphthamide (Figure 2B, lane 1). Taken together, these findings indicate that there is an additional step before the last amidation\nand dph7 mutants specifically accumulate diphthine-modified eEF2, demonstrating failure to complete the final amidation step. Consistent with an expected requirement for ATP in diphthine amidation, Dph6 contains an essential adenine nucleotide hydrolase domain and binds to eEF2. Dph6 is therefore a candidate for the elusive amidase, while Dph7 apparently couples diphthine synthase (Dph5) to diphthine amidation. The latter conclusion is based on our observation that dph7 mutants show drastically upregulated interaction between Dph5 and eEF2, indicating that their association is kept in check by Dph7. Physiologically, completion of diphthamide synthesis is required for optimal translational accuracy and cell growth, as indicated by shared traits among the dph mutants including increased ribosomal -1 frameshifting and altered responses to translation inhibitors. Through identification of Dph6 and Dph7 as components required for the amidation step of the diphthamide pathway, our work paves the way for a detailed mechanistic understanding of diphthamide formation. Identification\nthe ATP-binding domain required. The actual diphthamide synthetase, Dph6, was identified independently by three groups using comparative genomic analysis, yeast cofitness analysis, and yeast gene interaction databases. (A) Proposed Diphthamide Biosynthesis Pathway in Current Literature. (B) Revised Diphthamide Biosynthesis Pathway in Eukaryotes What is the exact role of Dph7 in the pathway then? Initially, we thought that Dph7 could be a scaffold protein for the amidation reaction, as it contains WD40 domains that are known to mediate protein\u2013protein interactions. Contrary to this notion, Dph6 and Dph7 were not found to interact with each other by coimmunoprecipitation. It was also suggested that Dph7 is required to displace Dph5 after the second step to allow amidation catalyzed by Dph6 to occur, as eEF-2 binds more Dph5 in the absence of Dph7. Interestingly, a novel methylated diphthamide (3, Figure 1) was recently reported in a lymphoma cell line with Dph7 gene deletion. This\nafter the fact that acid hydrolysis of eEF-2 with in vitro reconstitution of the second step yields 2. However, under such conditions, it was likely that 4a, a methyl ester, was hydrolyzed to 2 and was not detected. To investigate if 4a is produced by Dph5 in the second step, we reconstituted the reaction in vitro using purified eEF-2 from the \u0394dph5 yeast strain, SAM, and purified Dph5 protein. \u0394dph5 eEF-2 incubated with SAM but without Dph5 was used as a control. The \u0394dph5 strain is deficient in the second step of diphthamide biosynthesis, and therefore the eEF2 contains 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl (ACP) modified His699, the product of the first step. Both experimental and control eEF-2 samples were trypsin-digested and subjected to LC-MS analysis. In agreement with previous MS reports, we found ACP-modified peptide and unmodified peptide, but not other intermediates in the \u0394dph5 eEF-2 sample without Dph5. For the \u0394dph5 eEF-2",

The stained bands were eluted from the gel, treated with N- and O-glycosidase if necessary, and analyzed by Western blotting [M. Kawai, Y. Otake, Y. Hara High-molecular-mass isoform of aminopeptidase N/CD13 in serum from cholestatic patients. Clin Chim Acta 330 (2003) 141-149].RESULTS: Triton-PAGE and LAP-staining clearly detected fast bands in all the sera examined. Almost parallel with leucine aminopeptidase activity, slow bands were strongly stained in all 11 cholestatic patients but clearly stained in 3 out of 14 patients with hepatobiliary diseases other than cholestasis. PAGE with\nintramolecular charge transfer (ICT) states. Moreover, the highly constrained environment provided by subdomain IB of HSA resulted in a frozen conformation of the ligand, contributing to fluorescence enhancement. Computational studies were clearly in line with the experimental observations, providing valuable insight into the nature of the binding sites and the conformational arrangement of the ligands inside the protein cavities. Besides, a good correlation was found between the calculated binding energies for each ligand@protein complex and the relative affinities observed in competition experiments. Biochemical characterization of the triticale TsPAP1, a new type of plant prolyl aminopeptidase, and its impact on proline content and flowering time in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Proline aminopeptidase (PAP, EC 3.4.11.5) is the only enzyme that effectively releases proline from the N-termini of peptides. The amino acid sequence of the PAP from Triticosecale, TsPAP1, comprises conserved regions, characteristic of the monomeric forms of PAP found in bacteria but\nfurther characterization revealed that the SH residues are also important for maintaining its activity. To examine the role of TsPAP1 under physiological conditions, we developed transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing TsPAP1. Compared with wild-type plants, the transgenic lines accumulated more proline, flowered an average of 3.5 days earlier, and developed more siliques than did untransformed controls. Our paper is the first to describe the biochemical properties of a novel monomeric plant PAP and contributes to the functional characterization of PAP proteins in plants. Crystal structure of X-prolyl aminopeptidase from Caenorhabditis elegans: A cytosolic enzyme with a di-nuclear active site. Eukaryotic aminopeptidase P1 (APP1), also known as X-prolyl aminopeptidase (XPNPEP1) in human tissues, is a cytosolic exopeptidase that preferentially removes amino acids from the N-terminus of peptides possessing a penultimate N-terminal proline residue. The enzyme has an important role in the catabolism of proline containing peptides since peptide bonds adjacent to the\nsolubilized from inclusion bodies with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography. Purified beta1-LAP was refolded to its dimeric form using a chaotrope-mediated folding procedure. The dimeric beta1-LAP forms 90 kDa complexes with TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, and TGF-beta3, and reverses the inhibitory activity of TGF-beta1 on Mv1Lu cells. Solid phase binding assays demonstrate that refolded beta1-LAP binds to heparin and thrombospondin 1. FET cell adhesion promoted by refolded beta1-LAP was blocked by an RGD peptide. Purified beta1-LAP produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells, deglycosylated with N-glycosidase F, forms a 80-90 kDa complex with mature TGF-beta1. The carbohydrate structures of beta1-LAP are not required for binding to ligands or for its biological activity. Triton-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and leucine aminopeptidase activity staining detect Triton-slowed bands including high-molecular-mass aminopeptidase N (CD13) isoform in cholestatic patient sera. BACKGROUND: Western blotting of aminopeptidase N (APN) detects a high-molecular-mass isoform (260 kDa) [M.\nLAPs were shown to be involved in site-specific homologous recombination and transcription regulation; in plants, LAPs moonlight as molecular chaperones independently of the aminopeptidase activity; in mammalian cells, they are implicated in the N-terminal processing of certain proteins and have been proposed to have a role in the determination of cell redox status; while in some parasites, they participate in host cell invasion and the provision of amino acids essential for growth. There are four distinct LAPs in the TriTryp genomes, which can be classified according to their theoretical isoelectric points as acidic (LAP-A and LAP-A2), neutral (LAP-N), and basic (LAP-B). The sequence identity among the paralogues LAP-A, LAP-N, and LAP-B within a species is low, with the C-terminal domain and active site being more conserved. However, inspection of the lap-A2 genes reveals what appears to be an incomplete LAP in all three species and their genome surroundings might suggest\nobservation that questions its use as a specific drug target. While LAP-A is not essential, leucine depletion and subcellular localization studies performed under starvation conditions suggest a possible function of LAP-A in the response to nutrient restriction. ABSTRACT Leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) is found in all kingdoms of life and catalyzes the metal-dependent hydrolysis of the N-terminal amino acid residue of peptide or amino acyl substrates. LAPs have been shown to participate in the N-terminal processing of certain proteins in mammalian cells and in homologous recombination and transcription regulation in bacteria, while in parasites, they are involved in host cell invasion and provision of essential amino acids for growth. The enzyme is essential for survival in Plasmodium falciparum, where its drug target potential has been suggested. We report here the X-ray structures of three kinetoplastid acidic LAPs (LAP-As from Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania major) which were solved in the\nof Trypanosoma cruzi (LAPTc) assembles into a homohexamer and belongs to the M17 family of metallopeptidases Cloning and characterization of a leucyl aminopeptidase from three pathogenic Leishmania species A leucine aminopeptidase is involved in kinetoplast DNA segregation in Trypanosoma brucei Specificity of the wound-induced leucine aminopeptidase (LAP-A) of tomato activity on dipeptide and tripeptide substrates Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state Molecular structure of leucine aminopeptidase at 2.7-A resolution Bestatin, an inhibitor of aminopeptidase B, produced by actinomycetes Bestatin induces specific changes in Trypanosoma cruzi dipeptide pool Knockout of leucine aminopeptidase in Toxoplasma gondii using CRISPR/Cas9 Characterization of the Plasmodium falciparum M17 leucyl aminopeptidase.

The enzyme has an important role in the catabolism of proline containing peptides since peptide bonds adjacent to the imino acid proline are resistant to cleavage by most peptidases. We show that recombinant and catalytically active Caenorhabditis elegans APP-1 is a dimer that uses dinuclear zinc at the active site and, for the first time, we provide structural information for a eukaryotic APP-1 in complex with the inhibitor, apstatin. Our analysis reveals that C. elegans APP-1 shares similar mode of substrate binding and a common catalytic mechanism with other known X-prolyl aminopeptidases. Plant leucine aminopeptidases moonlight as molecular chaperones to alleviate stress-induced damage. Leucine aminopeptidases (LAPs) are present in animals, plants, and microbes. In plants, there are two classes of LAPs. The neutral LAPs (LAP-N and its orthologs) are constitutively expressed and detected in all plants, whereas the stress-induced acidic LAPs (LAP-A) are expressed only in a subset of\nMEM. dox, doxycycline. Role of LAP-A in leucine starvation. LAPs cleave amino acids, preferentially leucine, from the N terminus of proteins or peptides and are important for protein recycling and turnover. It is reasonable to speculate that the depletion or overexpression of an aminopeptidase will have an increased effect on cell fitness upon exposure to suboptimal extracellular amino acid concentrations. In the event of LAP-A depletion, extracellular leucine levels might be particularly important. To test the effect of leucine limitation on the growth and cell cycle of PFs of T. brucei subsp. brucei, cultures were grown in glucose-free MEM prepared without leucine and with dialyzed FBS to ensure that no small peptides or undefined amino acids were present. Parental and LAP-A-dKO cells from cultures grown in MEM containing leucine (with dialyzed FBS) were transferred to MEM without leucine and incubated at culture temperature.

The cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 5,000 \u00d7 g and 4\u00b0C, and the supernatant was loaded onto an equilibrated 5-ml HisTrap crude FF column (GE Healthcare). Protein was eluted with an imidazole gradient of 30 to 500 mM in buffer A, and the protein-containing fractions identified by SDS-PAGE were pooled. The LAP-As with cleavable N-terminal His tags were concentrated to ~30 ml before the addition of HRV 3C protease in an approximate ratio of 1:100 (protease-to-LAP-A ratio). Proteolysis was monitored by SDS-PAGE and reached completion after 16 h at 4\u00b0C. Subsequently, the protein buffer was exchanged into buffer A with centrifuge filters (Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter from Millipore or Vivaspin6 from Sartorius Stedim Biotech, 50-kDa cutoff) and another nickel affinity purification performed as described above. The untagged LAP-A in the flowthrough fraction was concentrated to an ~1-ml\nTbLAP-B has been shown to localize to the kinetoplast and has a function distinct from that of LAP-A, which is cytosolic. The establishment of subcellular LAP-A as a cytosolic enzyme may contribute to the understanding of its physiological function, which would be distinct from the potential endoplasmic reticulum neutral aminopeptidase. Thus, while LAP-A would perform metabolic or housekeeping functions in the cytosol, in the endoplasmic reticulum, it could be involved in the posttranslational modification of N-terminal signal peptides of specific proteins, performing a regulatory role. In the present study, the enzyme appears to be mainly cytosolic and mostly excluded from the nucleus, and hence, an involvement in site-specific homologous recombination, as reported in E. coli, also seems improbable. A similar localization of LAP-B was described in immunocytochemical studies with antibodies in L. amazonensis promastigotes, where diffuse fluorescence throughout the parasite cytosol was observed. While not essential for efficient proliferation, LAP-A\nPDB, TriTryp LAP-As have an \u03b1 helix at the N terminus (\u03b1-1) that interacts with the neighboring protomer of the hexamer. The N-terminal domain is connected to the C-terminal domain via a long \u03b1 helix (\u03b17). The highly conserved C-terminal domain (aa 215 to 521), nearly identical to the structures of other LAPs in the PDB, shows a central eight-stranded \u03b2 sheet (\u03b27, \u03b28, \u03b210, \u03b29, \u03b213, \u03b217, \u03b214, and \u03b215) surrounded by \u03b1 helices (\u03b18 to \u03b117) and a small \u03b2 sheet (\u03b211, \u03b212, and \u03b216). The C-terminal domain contains the active site and forms the core of the hexamer, arranged around a central 3-fold axis with the active sites facing the central cavity, secluded from the surrounding bulk solvent. In TcLAP-A, some loop regions in the N-terminal domain (between \u03b12 and \u03b22, \u03b23 and \u03b24, \u03b15 and \u03b25, and \u03b16 and \u03b26) and in the C-terminal domain (between\nof the hexamer. (B) Superposition of TbLAP-A and LmLAP-A protomers. The TbLAP-A N-terminal helix (\u03b11) is blue, the N-terminal domain is light blue, and the C-terminal domain is green. For LmLAP-A, \u03b11 is red, the N-terminal domain is coral, and the C-terminal domain is lemon. The Mn2+ ions in the active sites are shown as tan spheres. This and subsequent structure images were made in CCP4mg, and superpositions were carried out with SSM. Like other M17 family LAP structures in the PDB, the TriTryp LAP-As have two domains (N and C terminal) (Fig. 1B). The smaller N-terminal domain (amino acids [aa] 2 to 197) consists of a six-stranded \u03b2 sheet (\u03b21, \u03b26, \u03b25, \u03b22, \u03b24, and \u03b23) flanked by five \u03b1 helices (\u03b12 to \u03b16).

LAPs cleave amino acids, preferentially leucine, from the N terminus of\nwas generally poor but sufficient to build the actinonin in all six chains. Their densities varied slightly, so that the ligand was modeled in each chain individually, with variation in their conformations. Nevertheless, the actinonin coordination was identical in all chains and differed only slightly from that in LmLAP-A (Fig. 3B). Actinonin in LmLAP-A and TbLAP-A is coordinated by the Mn2+ ions and hydrogen bonds. In both structures, the two Mn2+ atoms coordinate the O-2 and O-4 oxygen atoms of the ligand. In LmLAP-A, the side chains of K299, D304, K311, and D389 form hydrogen bonds with O-2 and O-4, and the main-chain oxygen of L420 and the main-chain nitrogen of G422 form hydrogen bonds with N-1 and O-13, respectively. The N-14 atom of actinonin coordinates a water molecule. The corresponding residues in TbLAP-A are K289, D294, K301, D371, L402, and G404, and A405 forms an additional hydrogen bond with\nnot essential either for growth in vitro or for infectivity in mouse models, therefore precluding its exploitation as a drug target. Protection against leucine depletion and the behavior of the enzyme during starvation suggest a possible role in the response to nutrient restriction. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning of LAP-A genes and protein expression in E. coli. The genes encoding the LAP-As were amplified from genomic DNA (T. brucei Lister427, T. cruzi Sylvio X10/1, and L. major Friedlin) and cloned into the YSBLIC3C vector by ligase-independent cloning. Successful cloning was confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion and sequencing. The resulting constructs (pTbLAP-3C, pTcLAP-3C, and pLmLAP-3C) encoded the LAP-A proteins with an N-terminal fusion to a hexahistidine tag separated from the N terminus of the protein by the recognition site of the human rhinovirus (HRV) 3C protease. Recombinant full-length TbLAP-A was overexpressed from the pTbLAP-3C vector into BL21(DE3) cells grown in LB medium\nThe electron density of the ligand was well defined in all 12 chains in the asymmetric unit and was modeled in the same conformation (Fig. 3A). The bestatin conformation mimics the gem-diolate intermediate of the peptide substrate in the process of its cleavage, and its binding in TbLAP-A is identical to that in PfLAP (PDB code 3KR4). The coordination of bestatin is mainly facilitated through the Mn2+ ions and hydrogen bonding. The Mn2+ ions coordinate the N-2 nitrogen atom and O-2 and O-3 oxygen atoms. Additionally, N-2 is coordinated through hydrogen bonds with the side chain oxygens of D294 and D312, as well as the main-chain oxygen of T401. The main-chain oxygen of D371 and the side chains of K289 and D294 form hydrogen bonds with O-2, while the side chain of K301 forms a hydrogen bond with O-3. Furthermore, bound HCO3\u2212 forms a hydrogen bond with the O-2 atom.",

HIF-1alpha is stabilized, translocates to the nucleus, interacts with hypoxia-responsive elements, and promotes the activation of target genes. This report shows that cyclosporin A (CsA) interferes with the hypoxic signaling cascade in C6 glioma cells. CsA inhibits hypoxia-dependent gene transcription in a reporter gene assay and prevents the hypoxic accumulation of HIF-1alpha. Addition of the 530-603 C-terminal oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain of HIF-1alpha to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) destabilized the protein in an oxygen-dependent manner. CsA prevented the hypoxic stabilization of an ODD.GFP fusion protein.

The enzyme promoted [(35)S]vHL binding to glutathione S-transferase (GST).ODD fusion protein. This association increased in the presence of CsA. CsA effects were not observed when the proline residue corresponding to Pro-564 in the HIF-1alpha sequence was replaced by a hydroxyproline or an alanine residue. Finally, CsA increased vHL-ODD interaction during hypoxia. We conclude that CsA destabilizes HIF-1alpha by promoting hydroxylation of Pro-564 in the ODD domain. Such a mechanism may prevent hypoxic adaptation during CsA-induced nephrotoxicity and contribute to the adverse effects of this drug. Dominant negative AT2 receptor oligomers induce G-protein arrest and symptoms of neurodegeneration. Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) correlates with dysfunction of signaling mediated by Galphaq/11. Nondissociable angiotensin II AT2 receptor oligomers are linked to\nEnhanced hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 stability induced by 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (5-HMF) contributes to protection against hypoxia. We first reported the role of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (5-HMF) against hypoxia. Here, we studied the mechanism by using oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD)-Luc mice, which are a useful model to probe the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1). Compared with three other compounds that have been reported to have a role in stabilizing HIF-1\u03b1, 5-HMF caused stronger bioluminescence, which is indicative of HIF-1\u03b1 stability in the brain and kidney of ODD-Luc mice. We further demonstrated that the HIF-1\u03b1 protein accumulated in response to 5-HMF in the brains and kidneys of these mice, as well as in PC12 cells. Additionally, 5-HMF promoted the nuclear translocation of HIF-1\u03b1 and the transcriptional activity of HIF-1, which was evaluated by detecting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF ) mRNA expression. These results suggest that 5-HMF stabilized HIF-1\u03b1 and increased its activity. Considering the\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) correlates with dysfunction of signaling mediated by Galphaq/11. Nondissociable angiotensin II AT2 receptor oligomers are linked to the impaired Galphaq/11-stimulated signaling of AD patients and transgenic mice with AD-like symptoms. To further analyze the role of AT2 receptor oligomers, we induced the formation of AT2 oligomers in an in vitro cell system. Similarly as in vivo, sequential oxidative and transglutaminase-dependent cross-linking steps triggered the formation of AT2 oligomers in vitro. Elevated reactive oxygen species mediated oxidative cross-linking of AT2 monomers to dimers involving tyrosine residues located at putative interreceptor contact sites of the cytoplasmic loop connecting transmembrane helices III/IV. Cross-linked AT2 dimers were subsequently a substrate of activated transglutaminase-2, which targeted the carboxyl terminus of AT2 dimers, as assessed by truncated and chimeric AT2 receptors, respectively. AT2 oligomers acted as dominant negative receptors in vitro by mediating Galphaq/11 protein sequestration and Galphaq/11 protein arrest. The formation of\nendothelial growth factor (VEGF ) mRNA expression. These results suggest that 5-HMF stabilized HIF-1\u03b1 and increased its activity. Considering the role of proline hydroxylases (PHDs) in negatively regulating HIF-1\u03b1 stability, we explored whether 5-HMF interacts with the substrates and cofactors of PHDs, such as 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG), Fe(2+) and vitamin C (VC), which affects the activity of PHDs. The result revealed that 5-HMF did not interact with Fe(2+) or 2-OG but interacted with VC. This interaction was confirmed by subsequent experiments, in which 5-HMF entered into cells and reduced the VC content. The enhanced stability of HIF-1\u03b1 by 5-HMF was reversed by VC supplementation, and the improved survival of mice caused by 5-HMF under hypoxia was abrogated by VC supplementation. Thus, we demonstrated for the first time that 5-HMF increases HIF-1\u03b1 stability by reducing the VC content, which mediates the protection against hypoxia. The angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor: an\nof the pathological processes, as exemplified by tumour angiogenesis. The oxygen-sensitive alpha-subunits of HIF are primarily regulated by the enzymatic hydroxylation that induces rapid proteasomal degradation. The HIFalpha hydroxylases belong to a superfamily of dioxygenases that require the co-substrates oxygen and 2-oxoglutarate as well as the cofactors Fe2+ and ascorbate. The regulation of enzyme turnover by the concentration of the cosubstrate oxygen constitutes the interface between tissue oxygen level and the activity of HIF. The HIFalpha prolyl hydroxylases, termed PHDs/EGLNs (prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins/EGL nine homologues), bind to a conserved Leu-Xaa-Xaa-Leu-Ala-Pro motif present in all substrates identified so far. This recognition motif is present twice in HIF1alpha, which gives rise to a NODD [N-terminal ODD (oxygen-dependent degradation domain)] containing Pro402 of HIF1alpha and a CODD (C-terminal ODD) where Pro564 is hydroxylated. PHD1/EGLN2 and PHD2/EGLN1 hydroxylate both ODDs with higher activity towards CODD, whereas PHD3/EGLN3 is specific for CODD. The reason\noligomers acted as dominant negative receptors in vitro by mediating Galphaq/11 protein sequestration and Galphaq/11 protein arrest. The formation of AT2 oligomers and G-protein dysfunction could be suppressed in vitro and in vivo by an AT2 receptor mutant. Inhibition of AT2 oligomerization upon stereotactic expression of the AT2 receptor mutant revealed that Galphaq/11-sequestering AT2 oligomers enhanced the development of neurodegenerative symptoms in the hippocampus of transgenic mice with AD-like pathology. Thus, AT2 oligomers inducing Galphaq/11 arrest are causally involved in inducing symptoms of neurodegeneration. Roles of the intracellular regions of angiotensin II receptor AT2 in mediating reduction of intracellular cGMP levels. We have shown previously that the angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor AT2 reduces the intracellular levels of cGMP in Xenopus oocytes when activated by ligand binding, and the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the AT2 acts as a negative regulator of this function. Here we report the effects of mutations\nstability by reducing the VC content, which mediates the protection against hypoxia. The angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor: an enigmatic seven transmembrane receptor. Angiotensin II (AngII) interacts with two receptor subtypes, AT1 and AT2, belonging to the seven transmembrane receptor superfamily. Pharmacological investigations initially suggested that AT2 receptors antagonize AT1 effects. Data from AT2 receptor transgenic and knock-out mice have not been entirely consistent with this interpretation. At the cellular level, a clear mechanistic model of AT2 transduction and signalling has yet to emerge. The AT2 receptor displays the hallmark motifs and signature residues of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), but fails to demonstrate most of the classic features of GPCR signalling. In recent years, unbiased screens for AT2-interacting proteins have identified novel partner proteins involved in AT2 signalling, providing new insight into the mechanisms of AT2 action. A growing body of evidence suggests that the AT2 receptor is\ninteraction between the AT2 receptor and the ErbB3 receptor seems to require the region spanning the third ICL and carboxy terminus of the AT2 receptor. Since the third ICL of the AT2 receptor is essential for exerting its inhibitory effects on cell growth, possible involvement of this region in the interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of the ErbB3 receptor suggests a novel signaling mechanism for the AT2 receptor mediated inhibition of cell growth. Furthermore, since both the AT2 and the ErbB3 receptors are expressed during fetal development, we propose that the existence of direct interaction between these two receptors may play a role in the regulation of growth during the initial stages of development. Cyclosporin A prevents the hypoxic adaptation by activating hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha Pro-564 hydroxylation. The mechanism by which hypoxia induces gene transcription involves the inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha prolyl hydroxylase activity, which prevents von Hippel-Lindau (vHL)-dependent targeting\nbetween the residues Gly-Xaa-Gly-Xaa-Xaa-Gly721 and Lys742, the residues predicted to be important for ATP binding of the ErbB3 and ErbB2 receptors, was identified to be interacting with the AT2 receptor. The interaction between the human ErbB3 receptor and the AT2 receptor was further confirmed using the cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 671-782) of the human ErbB3 receptor. Moreover, an AT2 receptor peptide that spans the amino acids 226-363, (spans the third ICL and carboxy terminal domain) could also interact with the AT2 receptor in a yeast Two-Hybrid protein-protein interaction assay. Studies using mutated and chimeric AT2 receptors showed that replacing the third intracellular loop (ICL) of the AT2 receptor with that of the AT1 abolishes the interaction between the ErbB3 and the AT2 in yeast Two-Hybrid protein-protein interaction assay. Thus the interaction between the AT2 receptor and the ErbB3 receptor seems to require the region spanning the third ICL and carboxy\nICLs of AT2 in AT2-mediated cGMP reduction in oocytes, and AT2-mediated SHP1 activation in COS-7 cells, (need of 3rd ICL for both functions and lack of involvement of DRY motif), suggest that the cascade of events in these two signaling mechanisms could be similar, and that an oocyte-specific SHP1-like protein may be involved in AT2-mediated cGMP reduction in these cells. Enzyme substrate recognition in oxygen sensing: how the HIF trap snaps. The transcriptional activator HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) is a focal point of biomedical research because many situations in physiology and in pathology coincide with hypoxia. The effects of HIF activation may be a facet of normal growth, as in embryonic development, they may counterbalance a disease, as seen in the stimulation of erythropoiesis in anaemia, and they may be part of the pathological processes, as exemplified by tumour angiogenesis. The oxygen-sensitive alpha-subunits of HIF are primarily regulated by the enzymatic\nproviding new insight into the mechanisms of AT2 action. A growing body of evidence suggests that the AT2 receptor is constitutively active (i.e. signals without AngII). This review critically evaluates controversies surrounding physiological functions and signalling mechanisms of the AT2 receptor, primarily in a cardiovascular context. Recent advances in the field are highlighted and findings challenging the concept that the AT2 receptor is a conventional angiotensin receptor are considered. Identification of an interaction between the angiotensin II receptor sub-type AT2 and the ErbB3 receptor, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family. To identify the proteins that interact and mediate angiotensin II receptor AT2-specific signaling, a random peptide library was screened by yeast-based Two-Hybrid protein-protein interaction assay technique. A peptide that shared significant homology with the amino acids located between the residues Gly-Xaa-Gly-Xaa-Xaa-Gly721 and Lys742, the residues predicted to be important for ATP binding of the ErbB3 and ErbB2\ncytoplasmic tail of the AT2 acts as a negative regulator of this function. Here we report the effects of mutations in the 2nd and 3rd intracellular loops of AT2 on AT2-mediated cGMP reduction. Mutating the highly conserved DRY motif (D141G-R142G-Y143A) of the 2nd ICL implicated in activating G(alpha) subunit of trimeric G-proteins did not affect AT2-mediated cGMP reduction. Moreover, anti-Gialpha antibody or phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX did not inhibit AT2-mediated cGMP reduction, suggesting that Gialpha activation and subsequent phosphodiesterase activation are not involved in this function. In contrast, mutations T250R-R251N and L255F-K256R located in the C-terminus of the 3rd ICL of AT2 retained ligand-binding properties of the wild-type AT2, and its ability to interact with the ErbB3 in yeast two-hybrid assay, but abolished AT2-mediated cGMP reduction. Similarities in the roles of ICLs of AT2 in AT2-mediated cGMP reduction in oocytes, and AT2-mediated SHP1 activation in COS-7 cells, (need of 3rd ICL\nhydroxylated. PHD1/EGLN2 and PHD2/EGLN1 hydroxylate both ODDs with higher activity towards CODD, whereas PHD3/EGLN3 is specific for CODD. The reason for this behaviour has been unclear. In this issue of the Biochemical Journal, Villar and colleagues demonstrate that distinct PHD/EGLN domains, that are remote from the catalytic site, function in substrate discrimination. This elegant study improves our understanding of the interaction of the oxygen-sensing PHDs/EGLNs with their substrates, which include, but are not limited to, the HIFalpha proteins.",

As protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are also important in disease development, protein-protein interactions are highlighted in the pharmaceutical industry as possible therapeutic targets in recent years. To understand the variety of protein-protein interactions in a proteome, it is essential to establish a method that can identify similarity and dissimilarity between protein-protein interactions for inferring the binding of similar molecules, including drugs and other proteins. In this study, we developed a novel method, protein-protein interaction-Surfer, which compares and quantifies similarity of local surface regions of protein-protein interactions. protein-protein interaction-Surfer represents a protein-protein interaction surface with overlapping surface patches, each of which is described with a three-dimensional Zernike descriptor (3DZD), a compact mathematical representation of 3D function. 3DZD captures both the 3D shape and physicochemical properties of the protein surface. The performance of protein-protein interaction-Surfer was benchmarked on datasets of\ninteractions by signaling molecules, pharmacological agents or toxins, and screening for differences between cancerous and untransformed cells. Specificity and affinity quantification of protein-protein interactions. MOTIVATION: Most biological processes are mediated by the protein-protein interactions. Determination of the protein-protein structures and insight into their interactions are vital to understand the mechanisms of protein functions. Currently, compared with the isolated protein structures, only a small fraction of protein-protein structures are experimentally solved. Therefore, the computational docking methods play an increasing role in predicting the structures and interactions of protein-protein complexes. The scoring function of protein-protein interactions is the key responsible for the accuracy of the computational docking. Previous scoring functions were mostly developed by optimizing the binding affinity which determines the stability of the protein-protein complex, but they are often lack of the consideration of specificity which determines the discrimination of native protein-protein complex against competitive ones.RESULTS: We developed a scoring function\nthe 3D shape and physicochemical properties of the protein surface. The performance of protein-protein interaction-Surfer was benchmarked on datasets of protein-protein interactions, where we were able to show that protein-protein interaction-Surfer finds similar potential drug binding regions that do not share sequence and structure similarity. protein-protein interaction-Surfer is available at https://kiharalab.org/ppi-surfer. Binding-sites Prediction Assisting Protein-protein Docking. Most biological actions of proteins, including their ability to interact with one another, involve some specific parts of their three-dimensional structure, called binding sites. These have evolved for their ability to bind other molecules effectively and are often conserved in different proteins. Identifying protein-protein binding sites in a protein that is known to interact with other proteins can provide important clues to the function of the protein and can also be used in protein-protein docking studies to reduce the search space explored by docking algorithms. We have developed an algorithm for structural similarity search\nhypothesis, we expected large proteins to display higher connectivity in the physical protein-protein interaction network than small proteins, i.e. they should participate in more protein-protein interactions. Using available protein-protein interaction data from yeast 2-hybrid and protein affinity precipitation studies we compared the average connectivity for proteins in different size intervals. No statistically significant correlation between protein size and connectivity could be observed for proteins of intermediate size. However, comparing the size extremes, the largest proteins (>771 amino acids) entertained on average twice the number of protein-protein interactions as the smallest proteins (<202 amino acids) (Fig 2). This difference was highly significant (Students t-test, p = 2.1 \u00d7 10-6). To ensure that this correlation between protein connectivity and protein size was not influenced by the above-reported stronger correlation between protein abundance and protein size, partial correlation analysis, controlling for protein abundance, was carried out. However, controlling for protein abundance did not\nand protein size, partial correlation analysis, controlling for protein abundance, was carried out. However, controlling for protein abundance did not substantially affect the correlation between connectivity and size (partial correlation, p = 2.6 \u00d7 10-6). Large protein size is partially maintained by a demand for higher connectivity. Comparing S. cerevisiae protein-protein interaction data and protein size. Average number of protein-protein interactions in different size categories is displayed. We conclude that the selective pressure to maintain a large protein size at least partially may be a selective pressure to entertain more protein-protein interactions. Multi-functionality does not favor a large protein size Multi-functionality in individual proteins requires the maintenance of multiple biochemical domains; hence multi-functionality may be regarded as a possible selective force favoring large protein sizes in the face of the evolutionary pressure to reduce genome size and biosynthetic costs. It is reasonable to expect that yeast protein multi-functionality at least\nProtein-protein binding affinity is a metric that estimates the binding strength between two protein binding partners. Reliable information on their binding affinity is of great value in understanding complex biological processes as well as in designing protein-based therapeutics. In this work, the interface and surface areas in protein-protein interaction are explored with respect to their relative importance in better predicting the protein-protein binding affinity. The results from this study showed that different types of areas contribute importantly to protein-protein interactions and thus should be jointly considered in an explicit manner to improve affinity predictions. In addition, the effective application of interface and surface areas may also facilitate the simulation of the protein folding and binding processes. Quantitative comparison of protein-protein interaction interface using physicochemical feature-based descriptors of surface patches. Driving mechanisms of many biological functions in a cell include physical interactions of proteins. As protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are also important\naccording to Kellis et al; dubious genes not conserved between closely related yeast species were thus discarded (5256 genes were retained). Protein size was here considered as protein length (number of amino acids), however, as the correlation between protein length and protein weight in yeast is essentially linear (r2 = 0.9987) protein length and weight may be regarded as equivalent measures. Protein expression data To investigate whether the reported negative correlation between codon bias and protein size reflects a true evolutionary constraint by protein size on protein expression, protein size data (as above) was compared to data on protein abundance (molecules/cell) obtained by Ghaemmaghami et al. The comparison encompassed 3663 epitope-tagged open reading frames expressed from their natural chromosomal locus during exponential growth in optimal conditions. Phenotypic data To investigate whether the demand for increased protein size represents a demand for multiple functional domains and pleiotrophy, protein size data (as\ndocking studies to reduce the search space explored by docking algorithms. We have developed an algorithm for structural similarity search in a database of non-redundant protein structures to find conserved binding regions on proteins involved in protein-protein interactions. We have used this algorithm to find conserved regions on a protein surface. The structurally conserved residues found were labeled as a protein-protein binding site, which allowed us to tune the AutoDock docking algorithm to predict the native protein complex structure from unbound protein structures. The conservation of protein structures that correctly predicted protein-protein binding site was used in AutoDock program to improve protein-protein docking. A web application based on our method is available at http://probis.cmm.ki.si. The roles of molecular chaperones in vivo. Table 1 summarizes the families of chaperones mentioned in this review, and lists their proposed functions. Many of these proteins are named in the accompanying review of Burston and\nproteins as potential regulators of multiple cellular signalling processes, but in many cases the physiological significance of such roles remains only partly validated and needs to be considered in the context of the tight control of LNX1/2 protein levels in vivo. No simple dependence between protein evolution rate and the number of protein-protein interactions: only the most prolific interactors tend to evolve slowly Background It has been suggested that rates of protein evolution are influenced, to a great extent, by the proportion of amino acid residues that are directly involved in protein function. In agreement with this hypothesis, recent work has shown a negative correlation between evolutionary rates and the number of protein-protein interactions. However, the extent to which the number of protein-protein interactions influences evolutionary rates remains unclear. Here, we address this question at several different levels of evolutionary relatedness. Results Manually curated data on the number of protein-protein\nsurface areas in protein-protein binding affinity prediction: A machine learning analysis based on linear regression and artificial neural network. Protein-protein interaction plays an important role in all biological systems. The binding affinity between two protein binding partners reflects the strength of their association, which is crucial to the elucidation of the biological functions of these proteins and also to the design of protein-based therapeutic agents. In recent years, many studies have been conducted in an effort to improve the ability to predict the binding affinity of a protein-protein complex. Different sequence and structural features have been adopted in the prediction, but the surface or interface areas of the protein-protein complex were often not given adequate consideration. In the present study, different types of interface and surface areas in the protein-protein complex were used to construct or train linear, nonlinear or mixed models using linear regression and artificial neural network to\ninteraction networks. Focusing on 238 human 'extreme multifunctional' (EMF) proteins, we predicted 1411 3'UTR-protein complexes involving 54% of those proteins and evaluated their role in regulating protein cellular localization and multifunctionality. We find that EMF proteins lacking localization addressing signals, yet present at both the nucleus and cell surface, often form 3'UTR-protein complexes, and that the formation of these complexes could provide EMF proteins with the diversity of interaction partners necessary to their multifunctionality. Our findings are reinforced by archetypal moonlighting proteins predicted to form 3'UTR-protein complexes. Finally, the formation of 3'UTR-protein complexes that involves up to 17% of the proteins in the human protein-protein interaction network, may be a common and yet underestimated protein trafficking mechanism, particularly suited to regulate the localization of multifunctional proteins. Importance of interface and surface areas in protein-protein binding affinity prediction: A machine learning analysis based on linear regression and artificial neural network. Protein-protein\ncontaining the 116-kDa EF-2 homologue (116kD), the 200kD RNA unwindase, the 220kD protein, which is the orthologue of the yeast Prp8p protein, and the U5-40kD protein was detected by sedimentation analysis of the dissociated proteins. By cDNA cloning, we show that the 40kD protein is a novel WD-40 repeat protein and is thus likely to mediate regulated protein-protein interactions. Additional biochemical analyses demonstrated that the 220kD protein binds simultaneously to the 40- and the 116kD proteins and probably also to the 200kD protein. Since the 220kD protein is also known to contact both the pre-mRNA and the U5 snRNA, it is in a position to relay the functional state of the spliceosome to the other proteins in the complex and thus modulate their activity.\nnuclear transport and translation initiation/elongation. Large proteins have significantly more protein-protein interactions than small proteins, suggesting that a requirement for multiple interaction domains may constitute a positive selective pressure for large protein size in yeast. The higher frequency of protein-protein interactions in large proteins was not accompanied by a higher phenotypic pleiotropy. Hence, the increase in interactions may not reflect an increase in function differentiation. Proteins of different sizes also evolved at similar rates. Finally, whereas the biological process involved was found to have little influence on protein size the biochemical activity exerted by the protein represented a dominant factor. More than one third of all biochemical activity classes were enriched in one or more size intervals. Conclusion In yeast, there is an inverse relationship between protein size and protein expression such that highly expressed proteins tend to be of smaller size. Also, protein size is moderately affected by protein\nof interacting partners on protein evolutionary rates might not be substantial. We sought to further investigate this phenomenon by examining the relationship between the number of protein-protein interacting partners and protein evolutionary rates for the yeasts S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe as well as for the proteobacteria Helicobacter pylori and Camplyobacter jejuni. Results and Discussion Evolutionary rates and protein-protein interactions: yeast A total of 1,879 pairs of orthologous proteins, one from S. cerevisiae and one from S. pombe, were identified (see Methods), and for 1,004 of these, there was data on protein-protein interactions of the S. cerevisiae member in the MIPS database. For these 1,004 orthologous pairs, the number of protein-protein interactions detected for the S. cerevisiae protein was plotted against the calculated substitution rates between orthologs (Figure 1a). As with a previous survey that compared conserved S. cerevisiae and C. elegans orthologs, there is a negative correlation between the\ncomplex were used to construct or train linear, nonlinear or mixed models using linear regression and artificial neural network to predict the binding affinity of protein-protein interactions. The relative importance of the different types of areas in the selected models for affinity prediction was analyzed using variable-controlling approach. In terms of performance, the best area-based binding affinity predictors appeared to be superior or at least comparable to the widely-used predictors PRODIGY (a contacts-based predictor) and LISA (Local Interaction Signal Analysis). This work highlights the importance of interface and surface areas in protein-protein binding interactions. It also sheds light on the more suitable computational approaches that may aid in solving some of the scientific and technical issues associated with protein-protein binding affinity prediction. SIGNIFICANCE: Protein-protein interactions are ubiquitous in living systems. Protein-protein binding affinity is a metric that estimates the binding strength between two protein binding partners. Reliable information on their\nthe consideration of specificity which determines the discrimination of native protein-protein complex against competitive ones.RESULTS: We developed a scoring function (named as SPA-PP, specificity and affinity of the protein-protein interactions) by incorporating both the specificity and affinity into the optimization strategy. The testing results and comparisons with other scoring functions show that SPA-PP performs remarkably on both predictions of binding pose and binding affinity. Thus, SPA-PP is a promising quantification of protein-protein interactions, which can be implemented into the protein docking tools and applied for the predictions of protein-protein structure and affinity.AVAILABILITY: The algorithm is implemented in C language, and the code can be downloaded from http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1865642/Optimization.cpp. Abelson kinase's intrinsically disordered region plays essential roles in protein function and protein stability.

Here we investigated the evolutionary forces that act on protein size in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae utilizing a system-wide bioinformatics approach. Data on yeast protein size was compared to global experimental data on protein expression, phenotypic pleiotropy, protein-protein interactions, protein evolutionary rate and biochemical classification. Results Comparing the experimentally determined abundance of individual proteins, highly expressed proteins were found to be consistently smaller than lowly expressed proteins, in accordance with the biosynthetic cost minimization hypothesis. Yeast proteins able to maintain a high expression level despite a large size tended to belong to a very distinct set of protein families, notably nuclear transport and translation initiation/elongation. Large proteins have significantly more protein-protein interactions than small proteins, suggesting that a requirement for\nabove) was compared to data dN/dS and dN/dS' ratios taken from Wall et al. The comparison comprised all genes conserved between four closely related species of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto group, excluding frame shifted or intron containing open reading frames, for a total of 2,918 genes. Interaction data To investigate whether the demand for increased protein size represents a demand for multiple protein-protein interaction domains, protein size data (as above) was compared to protein-protein interaction data obtained from the GRID database encompassing several large scale yeast 2-hybrid and affinity precipitation studies as well as numerous small scale investigations. Protein-protein interaction data, corresponding to 25,215 interactions, was obtained for the 5,256 genes. Functional classification data To investigate whether the demand for increased protein size represents a demand for certain large biochemical domains, i.e. if certain biochemical functions are overrepresented among proteins of larger size, protein size data (as above) was compared\nwe find that these proteins are especially prone (hypergeometric distribution assumption, p < 0.001) to be involved in protein synthesis, energy metabolism, and cellular transport (Fig 1E). Notably, three translation initiation factors, Fun12p, Clu1p and Rpg1p as well as three translation elongation factors, Eft1p, Eft2p andYef3p are both large and highly expressed. It may also be noted that the enrichment of cellular transport functions include four of the eight components of the COPI coatomer vesicle complex, Sec21p, Sec26p, Sec27p and Cop1p as well as a high proportion of nuclear transport function genes, both mRNA export and protein import. Protein connectivity affects protein size in yeast We hypothesized that the evolutionary pressure that maintains large protein size may reflect an underlying selection for more protein-protein interaction domains. In accordance with this hypothesis, we expected large proteins to display higher connectivity in the physical protein-protein interaction network than small proteins, i.e. they",

Methylation of recombinant histone octamers was tested after incubation with recombinant Smyd2.\nII. The Benzene Hematotoxic and Reactive Metabolite 1,4-Benzoquinone Impairs the Activity of the Histone Methyltransferase SET Domain Containing 2 (SETD2) and Causes Aberrant Histone H3 Lysine 36 Trimethylation (H3K36me3). Human SETD2 is the unique histone methyltransferase that generates H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3), an epigenetic mark that plays a key role in normal hematopoiesis. Interestingly, recurrent inactivating mutations of SETD2 and aberrant H3K36me3 are increasingly reported to be involved in hematopoietic malignancies. Benzene (BZ) is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant and carcinogen that causes leukemia. The leukemogenic properties of BZ depend on its biotransformation in the bone marrow into oxidative metabolites, in particular 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ). This hematotoxic metabolite can form DNA and protein adducts that result in the damage and the alteration of cellular processes. Recent studies suggest that BZ-dependent leukemogenesis could depend on epigenetic perturbations, notably aberrant histone methylation. We investigated whether H3K36 trimethylation by SETD2 could be impacted by BZ and\nto encompass the C-terminal 142 amino acids. Thus, our results suggest that HYPB HMTase may coordinate histone methylation and transcriptional regulation in mammals and open perspective for the further study of the potential roles of HYPB protein in hematopoiesis and pathogenesis of HD. Identification and characterization of Smyd2: a split SET/MYND domain-containing histone H3 lysine 36-specific methyltransferase that interacts with the Sin3 histone deacetylase complex Background Disrupting the balance of histone lysine methylation alters the expression of genes involved in tumorigenesis including proto-oncogenes and cell cycle regulators. Methylation of lysine residues is commonly catalyzed by a family of proteins that contain the SET domain. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the SET domain-containing protein, Smyd2. Results Smyd2 mRNA is most highly expressed in heart and brain tissue, as demonstrated by northern analysis and in situ hybridization. Over-expressed Smyd2 localizes to the cytoplasm and the nucleus in 293T cells.\ndimethylate histone H3 at lysine 4 using recombinant histone H3 as a substrate in an in-vitro HKMT assay.

Lanes 1 and 4 indicate that immunoprecipitated and myc-tagged Smyd3, but not myc-tagged Smyd2, dimethylates histone H3 at lysine 4. Lanes 2 and 5 show that neither Smyd2 (Y240F) nor Smyd3 (Y239F) dimethylate histone H3 at lysine 4. We conclude that Smyd2 does not dimethylate histone H3 at lysine 4.

The HSPC069/HYPB gene was originally isolated from the human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), and it was also identified as a huntingtin interacting protein, implicated in the pathogenesis of Huntington disease (HD). However, its biochemical function is poorly understood. Here we report the structural and functional characterization of the huntingtin interacting protein B (HYPB). 1) The triplicate AWS-SET-PostSET domains mediate a histone H3 lysine 36 specific HMTase activity. 2) A low charged region that is rich in glutamine and proline has been characterized as a novel transcriptional activation domain.

A 17 kD band corresponding to 3H-labelled H3 was seen with both Smyd3 and Smyd2 in the fluorogram (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 3), indicating that Smyd2 has intrinsic HKMT activity. A tyrosine in the C-terminal region of the core SET domain is conserved among catalytically active SET domain proteins (Fig. 1C). Therefore, to test if the SET domain is required for the HKMT activity observed for Smyd2, point mutations were made in this residue of Smyd3-Myc (Y239F) and Smyd2-Myc (Y240F). Neither Smyd3 (Y239F)-Myc nor Smyd2 (Y240F)-Myc displayed HKMT activity (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 4). Smyd2 dimethylates Histone H3 lysine 36.

Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation using antibodies against subunits of pol II confirmed that the phosphorylated form of pol II is indeed an integral part of the Set2 complex. Gst-Set2 preferentially binds to CTD synthetic peptides phosphorylated at serine 2, and to a lesser extent, serine 5 phosphorylated peptides, but has no affinity for unphosphorylated CTD, suggesting that Set2 associates with the elongating form of the pol II. Furthermore, we show that set2Delta ppr2Delta double mutants (PPR2 encodes TFIIS, a transcription elongation factor) are synthetically hypersensitive to 6-azauracil, and that deletions in the CTD reduce in vivo levels of H3 lysine 36 methylation. Collectively, these results suggest that Set2 is involved in regulating transcription elongation through its direct contact with pol II. The Benzene Hematotoxic and Reactive Metabolite 1,4-Benzoquinone Impairs the Activity of the Histone Methyltransferase SET Domain Containing 2 (SETD2)\nRNA polymerase II carboxyl-terminal domain phosphorylation regulates protein stability of the Set2 methyltransferase and histone H3 di- and trimethylation at lysine 36. Methylation of lysine 36 on histone H3 (H3K36) is catalyzed by the Set2 methyltransferase and is linked to transcriptional regulation. Previous studies have shown that trimethylation of H3K36 by Set2 is directed through its association with the phosphorylated repeats of the RNA polymerase C-terminal domain (RNAPII CTD). Here, we show that disruption of this interaction through the use of yeast mutants defective in CTD phosphorylation at serine 2 results in a destabilization of Set2 protein levels and H3K36 methylation. Consistent with this, we find that Set2 has a short half-life and is co-regulated, with RNAPII CTD phosphorylation levels, during logarithmic growth in yeast. To probe the functional consequence of uncoupling Set2-RNAPII regulation, we expressed a truncated and more stable form of Set2 that is capable of dimethylation but\nE3 ligase complex, KAT \u2013 lysine acetytltransferase, Mst2C \u2013 Mst2 complex, qPCR \u2013 quantitative PCR, RNAi \u2013 RNA interference, RNAP \u2013 RNA polymerase, SAGA \u2013 Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase, SHREC \u2013 Snf2/Hdac repressive complex, TAS \u2013 telomere-associated sequence, TERRA \u2013 telomeric repeat-containing non-coding RNA, WT \u2013 wild-type. PTIP associates with MLL3- and MLL4-containing histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase complex. PTIP, a protein with tandem BRCT domains, has been implicated in DNA damage response. However, its normal cellular functions remain unclear. Here we show that while ectopically expressed PTIP is capable of interacting with DNA damage response proteins including 53BP1, endogenous PTIP, and a novel protein PA1 are both components of a Set1-like histone methyltransferase (HMT) complex that also contains ASH2L, RBBP5, WDR5, hDPY-30, NCOA6, SET domain-containing HMTs MLL3 and MLL4, and substoichiometric amount of JmjC domain-containing putative histone demethylase UTX. PTIP complex carries robust HMT activity and specifically methylates lysine 4 (K4)\nThe 600-kDa E(Z)/ESC complex, also known as Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), specifically methylates histone H3 lysine 27 (H3 K27) through the intrinsic histone methyltransferase (HMTase) activity of the E(Z) SET domain. By itself, E(Z) exhibits no detectable HMTase activity and requires ESC for methylation of H3 K27. The molecular basis for this requirement is unknown. ESC binds directly, via its C-terminal WD repeats (beta-propeller domain), to E(Z). Here, we show that the N-terminal region of ESC that precedes its beta-propeller domain interacts directly with histone H3, thereby physically linking E(Z) to its substrate. We show that when expressed in stable S2 cell lines, an N-terminally truncated ESC (FLAG-ESC61-425), like full-length ESC, is incorporated into complexes with E(Z) and binds to a Ubx Polycomb response element in a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. However, incorporation of this N-terminally truncated ESC into E(Z) complexes prevents trimethylation of histone H3 by E(Z).

PTIP complex carries robust HMT activity and specifically methylates lysine 4 (K4) on histone H3. Furthermore, PA1 binds PTIP directly and requires PTIP for interaction with the rest of the complex. Moreover, we show that hDPY-30 binds ASH2L directly. The evolutionarily conserved hDPY-30, ASH2L, RBBP5, and WDR5 likely constitute a subcomplex that is shared by all human Set1-like HMT complexes. In contrast, PTIP, PA1, and UTX specifically associate with the PTIP complex. Thus, in cells without DNA damage agent treatment, the endogenous PTIP associates with a Set1-like HMT complex of unique subunit composition. As histone H3 K4 methylation associates with active genes, our study suggests a potential role of PTIP in the regulation of gene expression.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Benzoquinone is a major leukemogenic metabolite of benzene. Dysregulation of histone methyltransferase is involved in hematopoietic malignancies. This study found that benzoquinone irreversibly impairs SET domain containing 2, a histone H3K36 methyltransferase that plays a key role in hematopoiesis. Benzoquinone forms covalent adducts on Zn-finger cysteines within the catalytic site, leading to loss of activity, protein crosslinks/oligomers, and concomitant decrease of H3K36me3 histone mark. These data provide evidence that a leukemogenic metabolite of benzene can impair a key epigenetic enzyme. A novel method for purification of the endogenously expressed fission yeast Set2 complex.

Set1C methylates lysine 4 of H3, thus adding a new specificity and a new subclass of SET domain proteins known to methyltransferases. Since methylation of H3 lysine 4 is widespread in eukaryotes, we screened the databases and found other Set1 homologues. We propose that eukaryotic Set1Cs are H3 lysine 4 methyltransferases and are related to trxG action through association with Ash2 homologues. A nucleosome surface formed by histone H4, H2A, and H3 residues is needed for proper histone H3 Lys36 methylation, histone acetylation, and repression of cryptic transcription. Set2-mediated H3 Lys(36) methylation is a histone modification that has been demonstrated to function in transcriptional elongation by recruiting the Rpd3S histone deacetylase complex to repress intragenic cryptic transcription. Recently, we identified a trans-histone pathway in which the interaction between the N terminus of Set2 and histone H4 Lys(44) is needed to mediate trans-histone\nAll authors read and approved the final manuscript.

Methylation of recombinant histone octamers was tested after incubation with recombinant Smyd2. Consistently, recombinant Smyd2 was observed to methylate histone H3 (Fig. 2B, lane 1). Therefore, we conclude that the Smyd2 has SET domain-dependent, intrinsic HKMT activity. Smyd2 dimethylates H3K36 Given that both Smyd1 and Smyd3 have been shown to have specificity for H3K4, we tested whether Smyd2 has similar specificity. Histone methyltransferase assays were performed using recombinant H3, and specificity was determined by western blotting using antibodies against various methyl-lysine residues. The antibodies used in these assays include anti-dimethyl H3K4, anti-trimethyl H3K4, anti-dimethyl H3K9, anti-trimethyl H3K9, anti-trimethyl H3K27, anti-di-methyl H3K36, and anti-dimethyl H3K79. A 17 KD band corresponding to H3 was observed with Smyd3, but not with Smyd2, when reactions were probed with anti-dimethyl H3K4 (Fig. 2D, lanes 4 and 1, respectively) or anti-trimethyl H3K4 (data not shown). This indicated that\nsupport the view that Set2 function in chromatin metabolism can intimately involve histone chaperone Asf1. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Set1 complex includes an Ash2 homologue and methylates histone 3 lysine 4. The SET domain proteins, SUV39 and G9a have recently been shown to be histone methyltransferases specific for lysines 9 and 27 (G9a only) of histone 3 (H3). The SET domains of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Set1 and Drosophila trithorax proteins are closely related to each other but distinct from SUV39 and G9a. We characterized the complex associated with Set1 and Set1C and found that it is comprised of eight members, one of which, Bre2, is homologous to the trithorax-group (trxG) protein, Ash2. Set1C requires Set1 for complex integrity and mutation of Set1 and Set1C components shortens telomeres. One Set1C member, Swd2/Cpf10 is also present in cleavage polyadenylation factor (CPF).

BACKGROUND: GDP-mannose 4,6 dehydratase (GMD) catalyzes the conversion of GDP-(D)-mannose to GDP-4-keto, 6-deoxy-(D)-mannose. This is the first and regulatory step in the de novo biosynthesis of GDP-(L)-fucose. Fucose forms part of a number of glycoconjugates, including the ABO blood groups and the selectin ligand sialyl Lewis X. Defects in GDP-fucose metabolism have been linked to leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II (LADII).RESULTS: The structure of the GDP-mannose 4,6 dehydratase apo enzyme has been determined and refined using data to 2.3 A resolution. GMD is a homodimeric protein with each monomer composed of two domains. The larger N-terminal domain binds the NADP(H) cofactor in a classical Rossmann fold and the C-terminal domain harbors the sugar-nucleotide binding site. We have\ntetrameric GDP-D-mannose 4,6-dehydratase from a bacterial GDP-D-rhamnose biosynthetic pathway. d-Rhamnose is a rare 6-deoxy monosaccharide primarily found in the lipopolysaccharide of pathogenic bacteria, where it is involved in host-bacterium interactions and the establishment of infection. The biosynthesis of d-rhamnose proceeds through the conversion of GDP-d-mannose by GDP-d-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMD) to GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose, which is subsequently reduced to GDP-d-rhamnose by a reductase. We have determined the crystal structure of GMD from Pseudomonas aeruginosa in complex with NADPH and GDP. GMD belongs to the NDP-sugar modifying subfamily of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) enzymes, all of which exhibit bidomain structures and a conserved catalytic triad (Tyr-XXX-Lys and Ser/Thr). Although most members of this enzyme subfamily display homodimeric structures, this bacterial GMD forms a tetramer in the same fashion as the plant MUR1 from Arabidopsis thaliana. The cofactor binding sites are adjoined across the tetramer interface, which brings the adenosyl phosphate moieties of the adjacent\nstringApp. The effects of the PTB extract on the pacemaker potential of interstitial cells of Cajal and GMD mouse models were investigated. In total, 12 compounds were found to target 13 GMD-related genes. In animal experiments, PTB was found to better regulate pacemaker potential in vitro and inhibit GMD signs compared to control groups in vivo. Animal studies showed that the mechanism underlying the effects of PTB is closely related to gastrointestinal motility. The results obtained demonstrated that PTB offers a potential means to treat GMDs, and we suggested that the medicinal mechanism of GMDs can be explained by the relationship between 12 major components of PTB, including oleic acid, and 13 GMD-related genes. Structural and enzymatic characterization of human recombinant GDP-D-mannose-4,6-dehydratase. GDP-D-mannose-4,6-dehydratase (GMD) is the key enzyme in the 'de novo' pathway of GDP-L-fucose biosynthesis. The reported cDNA sequences for human GMD predict three forms of different length, whose\npart of the serine-tyrosine-lysine catalytic triad common to the SDR family and Glu 135 functions as an active-site base. GDP-mannose-4,6-dehydratase is a cytosolic partner of tankyrase 1 that inhibits its poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity. Tankyrase 1 is a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) that participates in a broad range of cellular activities due to interaction with multiple binding partners. Tankyrase 1 recognizes a linear six-amino-acid degenerate motif and, hence, has hundreds of potential target proteins. Binding of partner proteins to tankyrase 1 usually results in their poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARsylation) and can lead to ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. However, it is not known how tankyrase 1 PARP activity is regulated. Here we identify GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMD) as a binding partner of tankyrase 1. GMD is a cytosolic protein required for the first step of fucose synthesis. We show that GMD is complexed to tankyrase 1 in the cytosol throughout interphase, but its association with tankyrase\nsynthesis. We show that GMD is complexed to tankyrase 1 in the cytosol throughout interphase, but its association with tankyrase 1 is reduced upon entry into mitosis, when tankyrase 1 binds to its other partners TRF1 (at telomeres) and NuMA (at spindle poles). In contrast to other binding partners, GMD is not PARsylated by tankyrase 1. Indeed, we show that GMD inhibits tankyrase 1 PARP activity in vitro, dependent on the GMD tankyrase 1 binding motif. In vivo, depletion of GMD led to degradation of tankyrase 1, dependent on the catalytic PARP activity of tankyrase 1. We speculate that association of tankyrase 1 with GMD in the cytosol sequesters tankyrase 1 in an inactive stable form that can be tapped by other target proteins as needed.

We cloned the GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose-3,5-epimerase-4-reductase gene from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtFX/GER1). The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was transfected with the AtFX/GER1 gene coexpressed with GDP-mannose-4,6-dehydratase gene of A. thaliana (MUR1). In vitro GDP-fucose synthesis activity was observed in the cytoplasmic fraction of cells coexpressing the AtFX/GER1 gene and MUR1 gene. However, the cytoplasmic fraction of cells expressing MUR1 alone did not show the GDP-mannose-4,6-dehydratase activity. This result suggests that the AtFX/GER1 protein may contribute to maintenance of the MUR1 protein as the active form. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that both proteins interact with each other, indicating that this interaction is required to maintain MUR1 protein as the active or stable form. Finally, in vivo GDP-fucose synthesis activity was analyzed by measuring the amount of GDP-fucose produced in the cytoplasm of yeast cells. The amount of GDP-fucose in cells coexpressing MUR1 and AtFX/GER1 genes was 3.5 times higher\nthaliana. The cofactor binding sites are adjoined across the tetramer interface, which brings the adenosyl phosphate moieties of the adjacent NADPH molecules to within 7 A of each other. A short peptide segment (Arg35-Arg43) stretches into the neighboring monomer, making not only protein-protein interactions but also hydrogen bonding interactions with the neighboring cofactor. The interface hydrogen bonds made by the Arg35-Arg43 segment are generally conserved in GMD and MUR1, and the interacting residues are highly conserved among the sequences of bacterial and eukaryotic GMDs. Outside of the Arg35-Arg43 segment, residues involved in tetrameric contacts are also quite conserved across different species. These observations suggest that a tetramer is the preferred, and perhaps functionally relevant, oligomeric state for most bacterial and eukaryotic GMDs. Interaction of GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose-3,5-epimerase-4-reductase with GDP-mannose-4,6-dehydratase stabilizes the enzyme activity for formation of GDP-fucose from GDP-mannose. We cloned the GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose-3,5-epimerase-4-reductase gene from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtFX/GER1). The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae\nof fucosylation on DR5. In addition, GMDS deficiency also inhibited CD95-mediated apoptosis but not the intrinsic apoptosis pathway induced by anti-cancer drugs. Binding of TRAIL and CD95 ligand to their cognate receptors primarily leads to formation of a complex comprising the receptor, FADD, and caspase-8, referred to as the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). GMDS deficiency did not affect formation of the primary DISC or recruitment to and activation of caspase-8 on the DISC. However, formation of secondary FADD-dependent complex II, comprising caspase-8 and cFLIP, was significantly inhibited by GMDS deficiency. These results indicate that GMDS regulates the formation of secondary complex II from the primary DISC independent of direct fucosylation of death receptors. Structure of the MUR1 GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase from Arabidopsis thaliana: implications for ligand binding and specificity. GDP-D-mannose 4,6-dehydratase catalyzes the first step in the de novo synthesis of GDP-L-fucose, the activated form of L-fucose, which is a component\nbinds the NADP(H) cofactor in a classical Rossmann fold and the C-terminal domain harbors the sugar-nucleotide binding site. We have determined the GMD dissociation constants for NADP, NADPH and GDP-mannose. Each GMD monomer binds one cofactor and one substrate molecule, suggesting that both subunits are catalytically competent. GDP-fucose acts as a competitive inhibitor, suggesting that it binds to the same site as GDP-mannose, providing a mechanism for the feedback inhibition of fucose biosynthesis.CONCLUSIONS: The X-ray structure of GMD reveals that it is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family of proteins. We have modeled the binding of NADP and GDP-mannose to the enzyme and mutated four of the active-site residues to determine their function. The combined modeling and mutagenesis data suggests that at position 133 threonine substitutes serine as part of the serine-tyrosine-lysine catalytic triad common to the SDR family and Glu 135 functions as an active-site base. GDP-mannose-4,6-dehydratase\nan unusual syn conformation. The protein-ligand interactions around the hexose moiety of the substrate support the importance of the conserved triad residues and an additional Glu side chain serving as a general base for catalysis. Phe and Arg side chains close to the hexose ring may serve to confer substrate specificity at the O2 position. In the MUR1/GDP-D-rhamnose complex, a single unique monomer within the protein tetramer that has an unoccupied substrate site highlights the conformational changes that accompany substrate binding and may suggest the existence of negative cooperativity in MUR1 function. Structural and functional analysis of parameters governing tankyrase-1 interaction with telomeric repeat-binding factor 1 and GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase. Human tankyrase-1 (TNKS) is a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) superfamily of proteins that posttranslationally modify themselves and target proteins with ADP-ribose (termed PARylation). The TNKS ankyrin repeat domain mediates interactions with a growing number of structurally and functionally diverse\nwith ADP-ribose (termed PARylation). The TNKS ankyrin repeat domain mediates interactions with a growing number of structurally and functionally diverse binding partners, linking TNKS activity to multiple critical cell processes, including Wnt signaling, Golgi trafficking, and telomere maintenance. However, some binding partners can engage TNKS without being modified, suggesting that separate parameters influence TNKS interaction and PARylation. Here, we present an analysis of the sequence and structural features governing TNKS interactions with two model binding partners: the PARylated partner telomeric repeat-binding factor 1 (TRF1) and the non-PARylated partner GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMD). Using a combination of TNKS-binding assays, PARP activity assays, and analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation analysis, we found that both the specific sequence of a given TNKS-binding peptide motif and the quaternary structure of individual binding partners play important roles in TNKS interactions. We demonstrate that GMD forms stable 1:1 complexes with the TNKS ankyrin repeat domain; yet, consistent with results\nthat quercetin, resveratrol, SCN5A, TNF, and FOS were most closely related to GMD. In addition, the SGR extract regulated the pacemaker activity in ICC and recovered the delayed gastric emptying. As a result of feeding the SGR extract to AA-induced GMD mice, it was confirmed that the ITR decreased by AA was restored by the SGR extract. Through network pharmacology, it was confirmed that quercetin, resveratrol, SCN5A, TNF, and FOS were related to GMD in SGR, and these were closely related to intestinal motility. Based on these results, it is suggested that SGR in GMD restores digestion through the recovery of intestinal motility. GDP-mannose-4,6-dehydratase (GMDS) deficiency renders colon cancer cells resistant to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor- and CD95-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting complex II formation. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis through binding to TRAIL receptors, death receptor 4 (DR4), and DR5. TRAIL has potential therapeutic\napoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis through binding to TRAIL receptors, death receptor 4 (DR4), and DR5. TRAIL has potential therapeutic value against cancer because of its selective cytotoxic effects on several transformed cell types. Fucosylation of proteins and lipids on the cell surface is a very important posttranslational modification that is involved in many cellular events. Recently, we found that a deficiency in GDP-mannose-4,6-dehydratase (GMDS) rendered colon cancer cells resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, resulting in tumor development and metastasis by escape from tumor immune surveillance. GMDS is an indispensable regulator of cellular fucosylation. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of inhibition of TRAIL signaling by GMDS deficiency. DR4, but not DR5, was found to be fucosylated; however, GMDS deficiency inhibited both DR4- and DR5-mediated apoptosis despite the absence of fucosylation on DR5. In addition, GMDS deficiency also inhibited CD95-mediated apoptosis but not the intrinsic apoptosis pathway induced by\n'de novo' pathway of GDP-L-fucose biosynthesis. The reported cDNA sequences for human GMD predict three forms of different length, whose 'in vivo' occurrence and molecular properties are completely undefined. Here, we report the expression in Escherichia coli and the properties of each native recombinant GMD form. Only the 42 kDa long GMD (L-GMD) and the 40.2 kDa (M-GMD) forms were recovered as soluble functional proteins, while the 38.7 kDa form, short GMD (S-GMD), lacking an N-terminal domain critical for dinucleotide binding, was inactive and formed a precipitate. Both L-GMD and M-GMD are homodimers and contain 1 mol of tightly bound NADP+. Their kinetic properties (Km, Kcat) are apparently identical and both forms are non-competitively feedback-inhibited by GDP-L-fucose to a similar extent. M-GMD is the predominant enzyme form expressed in several human cell lines. These data seem to suggest that modulation of the 'de novo' pathway of GDP-L-fucose biosynthesis involves mechanisms\ntemplates, T7 RNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), 2 mM NTPs, and 0.2 mM biotin-16-UTP (Roche). In vitro transcribed RNAs (15 \u00b5g) were incubated with tRNA-saturated streptavidin agarose resins (Thermo Scientific) in NET-2 buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 2 mM benzamidine, 0.05% NP-40) containing 100 U of RNase inhibitor (Thermo Scientific) at 4\u00b0C. For the preparation of cell extracts, HeLa cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and harvested by centrifugation at 3000g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Cell pellets were sonicated on ice with 2 \u00d7 30 bursts of 1 sec each (Branson Sonifier 250, output control 3, 30% duty cycle). After centrifugation at 13,000g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, the supernatant was precleared by incubating with 50 \u00b5L of streptavidin resins for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Precleared supernatant was mixed with in vitro transcribed RNA-bound streptavidin resin and incubated for 3 h\ncatalyzes the first step in the de novo synthesis of GDP-L-fucose, the activated form of L-fucose, which is a component of glycoconjugates in plants known to be important to the development and strength of stem tissues. We have determined the three-dimensional structure of the MUR1 dehydratase isoform from Arabidopsis thaliana complexed with its NADPH cofactor as well as with the ligands GDP and GDP-D-rhamnose. MUR1 is a member of the nucleoside-diphosphosugar modifying subclass of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase enzyme family, having homologous structures and a conserved catalytic triad of Lys, Tyr, and Ser/Thr residues. MUR1 is the first member of this subfamily to be observed as a tetramer, the interface of which reveals a close and intimate overlap of neighboring NADP(+)-binding sites. The GDP moiety of the substrate also binds in an unusual syn conformation. The protein-ligand interactions around the hexose moiety of the substrate support the importance of the conserved\nthe cytoplasm of yeast cells. The amount of GDP-fucose in cells coexpressing MUR1 and AtFX/GER1 genes was 3.5 times higher than the amount of GDP-mannose in the same cells, indicating that this coexpression system is suitable for production of the valuable sugar nucleotide GDP-fucose in yeast. Network Pharmacological Analysis and Experimental Validation of the Effect of Smilacis Glabrae Rhixoma on Gastrointestinal Motility Disorder. Gastrointestinal motility disorder (GMD) is a disease that causes digestive problems due to inhibition of the movement of the gastrointestinal tract and is one of the diseases that reduce the quality of life of modern people. Smilacis Glabrae Rhixoma (SGR) is a traditional herbal medicine for many diseases and is sometimes prescribed to improve digestion. As a network pharmacological approach, we searched the TCMSP database for SGR, reviewed its constituents and target genes, and analyzed its relevance to gastrointestinal motility disorder.

To investigate which molecular features of UPF1 are involved in GMD, we performed complementation experiments in which cells were depleted of UPF1 using UPF1 siRNA and exogenously expressed siRNA-resistant (R) UPF1 wild type or variants. The UPF1R variants used in this study were (1) \u0394(1\u201372), which lacks N-terminal 1\u201372 amino acids; (2) DEAA, which cannot hydrolyze ATP; (3) K498A, which fails to bind ATP; (4) R843C, which lacks helicase activity; and (5) 4SA, which contains amino acid substitutions from serine to alanine at preferentially phosphorylated residues 1073, 1078, 1096, and 1116 (Fig. 2A). Specific down-regulation of UPF1 by siRNA and comparable expression of UPF1R wild type and variants were confirmed by Western blotting (Supplemental Fig. S2A,B). Complementation results showed that the exogenous UPF1R wild type completely restored GMD of endogenous CCL2 mRNA (Fig. 2B,C).

On the other hand, all variants tested failed to restore GMD of CCL2 mRNA, indicating that N-terminal 1\u201372 amino acids, ATPase/helicase ability, and phosphorylation of UPF1 are important for efficient GMD. GMD requires ATPase/helicase activity, hyperphosphorylation, and the binding ability to PNRC2 of UPF1. (A) A schematic diagram of MYC-tagged UPF1R wild type and its variants.

HEK293T cells were transiently cotransfected with MS2-HA-PNRC2 and either MYC-UPF1R wild type or MYC-UPF1R\u0394(1\u201372). Immunoprecipitations were performed using either \u03b1-MYC antibody or a nonspecific mouse IgG (mIgG). The samples were analyzed by Western blotting before and after immunoprecipitation. The levels of coimmunoprecipitated MS2-HA-PNRC2 were normalized to the level of immunoprecipitated MYC-UPF1R. The normalized level obtained from the immunoprecipitation of MYC-UPF1R wild type was arbitrarily set to 1.0. n = 2. Because our previous data showed that down-regulation of SMG1 does not affect GMD, it was quite unexpected that UPF1R-4SA failed to restore GMD in our complementation experiments (Fig. 2C). To explain this discrepancy, we investigated the effect of other PI3KKs",

These results suggest that the two additional phosphorylation sites together with S67 allow ENSA to function as a 'stepwise tuner' for PP2A-B55, which may be regulated by multiple cellular signals, rather than a simple 'on/off' switch. \u03b2-Adrenergic regulation of cardiac type 2A protein phosphatase through phosphorylation of regulatory subunit B56\u03b4 at S573. BACKGROUND: Type 2A protein phosphatase (PP2A) enzymes are serine/threonine phosphatases which comprise a scaffold A subunit, a regulatory B subunit and a catalytic C subunit, and have been implicated in the dephosphorylation of multiple cardiac phosphoproteins. B subunits determine subcellular targeting, substrate specificity and catalytic activity, and can themselves be regulated by post-translational modifications. We explored potential \u03b2-adrenergic regulation of PP2A in cardiomyocytes through phosphorylation of the regulatory B subunit isoform B56\u03b4.METHODS AND RESULTS: Phosphate affinity SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis revealed increased phosphorylation of B56\u03b4 in adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM) exposed to the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor\nrevealed a striated expression pattern of PR72 and PR130 in heart and skeletal muscle, but not in bladder smooth muscle. The subcellular localisation and cell cycle regulatory ability of several PR72/B\" isoforms were determined, demonstrating differences as well as similarities.CONCLUSION: In contrast to PR55/B and PR61/B', the PR72/B\" family seems evolutionary more divergent, as only two of the murine genes have a human orthologue. We have integrated these results in a more consistent nomenclature of both human and murine PR72/B\" genes and their transcripts/proteins. Our results provide a platform for the future generation of PR72/B\" knockout mice. Positive regulation of Raf1-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling by protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2A holoenzymes. Protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulates a wide variety of cellular signal transduction pathways. The predominant form of PP2A in cells is a heterotrimeric holoenzyme consisting of a scaffolding (A) subunit, a regulatory (B) subunit, and a catalytic (C) subunit. Although PP2A\nthe aortas of mice fed a high fat diet had decreased AMP kinase Thr-172 phosphorylation, and contained an Ampk-PP2A(Ppp2r2d) complex. Thus, PP2A(Ppp2r2d) may antagonize the aortic AMP kinase activity necessary for maintaining normal aortic lipid metabolism. Inhibiting PP2A(Ppp2r2d) or activating AMP kinase represents a potential pharmacological treatment for many lipid-related diseases. Two conserved domains in regulatory B subunits mediate binding to the A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is an abundant heterotrimeric serine/threonine phosphatase containing highly conserved structural (A) and catalytic (C) subunits. Its diverse functions in the cell are determined by its association with a highly variable regulatory and targeting B subunit. At least three distinct gene families encoding B subunits are known: B/B55/CDC55, B'/B56/RTS1 and B\"/PR72/130. No homology has been identified among the B families, and little is known about how these B subunits interact with the PP2A A and C subunits. In vitro\nin the data bases. Notably, a high degree of homology (55-66%) was found with a yeast gene, RTS1, encoding a multicopy suppressor of a rox3 mutant. Our data indicate that at least seven B' subunit isoforms may participate in the generation of a large number of PP2A0 holoenzymes that may be spatially and/or functionally targeted to different cellular processes. Identification of a subunit of a novel Kleisin-beta/SMC complex as a potential substrate of protein phosphatase 2A. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzymes consist of a catalytic C subunit, a scaffolding A subunit, and one of several regulatory B subunits that recruit the AC dimer to substrates. PP2A is required for chromosome segregation, but PP2A's substrates in this process remain unknown. To identify PP2A substrates, we carried out a two-hybrid screen with the regulatory B/PR55 subunit. We isolated a human homolog of C. elegans HCP6, a protein distantly related to the condensin\nwere stimulated approximately 4-fold by heparin. The activity of AC-B' and rAC-B beta were increased 2-fold by Mn2+, while a 6-fold stimulation was observed with rAC-st. Chemical cross-linking of AC-B alpha and AC-B beta generated 200-kDa complexes, while AC-st was present as a 150-kDa complex. These results demonstrate that different regulatory proteins affect enzyme activity and the response to agents that modify PP2A activity in vitro. Different PP2A heterotrimers are likely to have distinct functions in vivo, and changes in subunit composition will have an important impact on signal transduction pathways. Diversity in genomic organisation, developmental regulation and distribution of the murine PR72/B\" subunits of protein phosphatase 2A. BACKGROUND: Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a serine/threonine-specific phosphatase displaying vital functions in growth and development through its role in various signalling pathways. PP2A holoenzymes comprise a core dimer composed of a catalytic C and a structural A subunit, which can associate\nfamilies, and little is known about how these B subunits interact with the PP2A A and C subunits. In vitro expression of a series of B56alpha fragments identified two distinct domains that bound independently to the A subunit. Sequence alignment of these A subunit binding domains (ASBD) identified conserved residues in B/B55 and PR72 family members. The alignment successfully predicted domains in B55 and PR72 subunits that similarly bound to the PP2A A subunit. These results suggest that these B subunits share a common core structure and mode of interaction with the PP2A holoenzyme. Regulation of \u03b1-endosulfine, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, by multisite phosphorylation. Progression into M phase requires inhibition of heterotrimeric PP2A containing the regulatory B55 subunit (PP2A-B55) as well as the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1). \u03b1-endosulfine (ENSA)/cyclic AMP-regulated 19 kDa phosphoprotein (ARPP-19) family proteins phosphorylated at S67 by Greatwall kinase bind and inhibit PP2A-B55.\nmodulators of TGF-beta/Activin/Nodal signalling that affect the pathway in opposite ways. Knockdown of Balpha in Xenopus embryos or mammalian tissue culture cells suppresses TGF-beta/Activin/Nodal-dependent responses, whereas knockdown of Bdelta enhances these responses. Moreover, in Drosophila, overexpression of Smad2 rescues a severe wing phenotype caused by overexpression of the single Drosophila PP2A B subunit Twins. We show that, in vertebrates, Balpha enhances TGF-beta/Activin/Nodal signalling by stabilising the basal levels of type I receptor, whereas Bdelta negatively modulates these pathways by restricting receptor activity. Thus, these highly related members of the same subfamily of PP2A regulatory subunits differentially regulate TGF-beta/Activin/Nodal signalling to elicit opposing biological outcomes. Comparison of heterotrimeric protein phosphatase 2A containing different B subunits. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is composed of structural (A), catalytic (C), and regulatory subunits (B). Immunological analyses identified B alpha/PR55 alpha as the major regulatory subunit of brain PP2A while a unique B' subunit was associated\na heterotrimeric holoenzyme consisting of a scaffolding (A) subunit, a regulatory (B) subunit, and a catalytic (C) subunit. Although PP2A is known to regulate Raf1-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling at multiple steps in this pathway, the specific PP2A holoenzymes involved remain unclear. To address this question, we established tetracycline-inducible human embryonic kidney 293 cell lines for overexpression of FLAG-tagged Balpha/delta regulatory subunits by approximately 3-fold or knock-down of Balpha by greater than 70% compared with endogenous levels. The expression of functional epitope-tagged B subunits was confirmed by the detection of A and C subunits as well as phosphatase activity in FLAG immune complexes from extracts of cells overexpressing the FLAG-Balpha/delta subunit. Western analysis of the cell extracts using phosphospecific antibodies for MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 demonstrated that activation of these kinases in response to epidermal growth factor was markedly diminished in Balpha knock-down cells but elevated in Balpha- and Bdelta-overexpressing cells as compared with\nsubunits of protein phosphatase 2A. Protein phosphatase (PP2A) 2A is a hetero-trimeric holoenzyme that consists of a core dimer composed of a catalytic subunit that is tightly complexed with the scaffolding subunit PR65/A. This core dimer associates with variable regulatory subunits of the PR55/B, PR61/B', PR72/B\" and PR93/PR110/B\"' families. As PP2A holoenzymes containing PR55/B have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, we characterized the PR55/B family with particular emphasis on its distribution and expression in the brain. We determined the genomic organization of all members of the PR55/B family and cloned their murine cDNAs. Thereby, two novel splice variants of PR55/Bbeta were identified. In addition, Northern blot analysis revealed multiple transcripts for the different PR55 subunits, suggesting a higher variability within the PR55 family. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that all PR55/B subunits were widely expressed in the brain. PR55/Balpha and Bbeta protein expression varies\ncomplexity in the expression of the B' subunit of protein phosphatase 2A0. Evidence for the existence of at least seven novel isoforms. Association of the catalytic subunit (C2) with a variety of regulatory subunits is believed to modulate the activity and specificity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). In this study we report the cloning and expression of a new family of B-subunit, the B', associated with the PP2A0 form. Polymerase chain reactions and cDNA library screening have identified at least seven cDNA isotypes, designated alpha, beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, beta 4, gamma, and delta. The different beta subtypes appear to be generated by alternative splicing. The deduced amino acid sequences of the alpha, beta 2, beta 3, beta 4 and gamma isoforms predict molecular weights of 57,600, 56,500, 60,900, 52,500, and 68,000, respectively. The proteins are 60-80% identical and differ mostly at their termini. Two of the isoforms,\nsurvival. Overall, these observations point to a context-dependent role of PP2A that warrants further exploration for therapeutic benefits. An anchoring factor targets protein phosphatase 2A to brain microtubules. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine phosphatase composed of a heterodimeric core enzyme that associates with a variety of regulatory subunits. A fraction of brain PP2A associates with microtubules and may play a role in regulating phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins. We examined the isoform specificity and the mechanism involved in the association of PP2A with brain microtubules. Only the R2alpha (B/PR55alpha) and R2beta (B/PR55beta) regulatory subunits associated with endogenous neural microtubules. Neither the R2gamma (B/PR55gamma) nor members of the R5 (B'/PR56) family of regulatory subunits co-sedimented with microtubules, although abundant amounts of these proteins were detected in brain. The efficient association of PP2A with microtubules in vitro was dependent on an anchoring activity present in a brain protein fraction\nanalyses identified B alpha/PR55 alpha as the major regulatory subunit of brain PP2A while a unique B' subunit was associated with the cardiac enzyme. Recombinant PP2A heterotrimers were purified from insect cells infected with baculoviruses expressing A and C, in combination with viruses expressing B alpha/PR55 alpha, B beta/PR55 beta, or SV40 small tumor antigen (st). Phosphatase activities of rAC-B alpha and rAC-B beta were similar to those for brain AC-B alpha, while rAC-st was 50-80% less active. Heparin had no effect on rAC-st myosin light chain phosphatase activity, while the B subunit-containing forms were stimulated 2-3-fold. Protamine caused a 3-4-fold increase in AC-B alpha and rAC-st activities and a marked activation of rAC-B beta (6-fold) and AC-B' (10.5-fold). When histone H1 was used as substrate, all of the heterotrimers were stimulated approximately 4-fold by heparin. The activity of AC-B' and rAC-B beta were increased 2-fold by Mn2+, while a\nBaculovirus expression, purification, and characterization of human protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunits alpha and beta. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) contains a 36-kDa catalytic subunit (PP2Ac), a 65-kDa structural subunit (PR65/A), and a regulatory B subunit. The core enzyme consists of the structural and catalytic subunits. The catalytic subunit exists as two closely related isoforms, alpha and beta. Several natural toxins, including okadaic acid (OA) and microcystins, specifically inhibit PP2A. To obtain biologically active recombinant PP2A and to compare the properties of the PP2A catalytic subunit alpha and beta isoforms, we expressed human PP2Acalpha and cbeta in High Five insect cells. The recombinant PP2Acalpha and cbeta possess similar phosphatase activities using p-NPP and phosphopeptide as substrates and are strongly inhibited by OA and microcystin-LR to similar degrees. In addition, PP2Acalpha or cbeta was co-expressed with PR65/A and co-purified as a core dimer, PP2AD (Aalpha/calpha and Aalpha/cbeta) with PR65alpha/Aalpha. The recombinant PP2AD\npathways. PP2A holoenzymes comprise a core dimer composed of a catalytic C and a structural A subunit, which can associate with a variable B-type subunit. The importance of the B-type subunits for PP2A regulation cannot be overestimated as they determine holoenzyme localisation, activity and substrate specificity. Three B-type subunit families have been identified: PR55/B, PR61/B' and PR72/B\", of which the latter is currently the least characterised.RESULTS: We deduced the sequences and genomic organisation of the different murine PR72/B\" isoforms: three genes encode nine isoforms, five of which are abundantly expressed and give rise to genuine PP2A subunits. Thereby, one novel subunit was identified. Using Northern blotting, we examined the tissue-specific and developmental expression of these subunits. All subunits are highly expressed in heart, suggesting an important cardiac function. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a striated expression pattern of PR72 and PR130 in heart and skeletal muscle, but not in bladder smooth muscle.\nspecific cellular compartments, confer substrate specificity and control enzyme activity. In spite of the progress made in determining the structure of the PP2A subunits, very little is known about the control of this activity and about substrate selection. Recent studies have unravelled a significant number of regulatory subunits. The potential existence of five distinct B or B-related polypeptides, some of which are present in multiple isoforms, two A and two C subunit isoforms, raises the possibility that a combinatorial association could generate a large number of specific PP2A forms with different substrate specificity and/or cellular localization. Moreover, biochemical, biological and genetic studies all concur in suggesting that the regulatory subunits may play an important role in determining the properties of the Ser/Thr protein phosphatases and hence their physiological functions. High complexity in the expression of the B' subunit of protein phosphatase 2A0. Evidence for the existence of at least seven\ninto mitosis is induced by the activation of cyclin-B-Cdk1 and Greatwall (Gwl; also known as MASTL in mammals) kinases. Cyclin-B-Cdk1 phosphorylates mitotic substrates, whereas Gwl activation promotes the phosphorylation of the small proteins Arpp19 and ENSA. Phosphorylated Arpp19 and/or ENSA bind to and inhibit PP2A comprising the B55 subunit (PP2A-B55; B55 is also known as PPP2R2A), the phosphatase responsible for cyclin-B-Cdk1 substrate dephosphorylation, allowing the stable phosphorylation of mitotic proteins. Upon mitotic exit, cyclin-B-Cdk1 and Gwl kinases are inactivated, and mitotic substrates are dephosphorylated. Here, we have identified protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) as the phosphatase involved in the dephosphorylation of the activating site (Ser875) of Gwl. Depletion of PP1 from meioticXenopusegg extracts maintains phosphorylation of Ser875, as well as the full activity of this kinase, resulting in a block of meiotic and mitotic exit. By contrast, preventing the reactivation of PP2A-B55 through the addition of a hyperactive Gwl mutant (GwlK72M) mainly\nthe regulatory B/PR55 subunit. We isolated a human homolog of C. elegans HCP6, a protein distantly related to the condensin subunit hCAP-D2, and we named this homolog hHCP-6. Both C. elegans HCP-6 and condensin are required for chromosome organization and segregation. HCP-6 binding partners are unknown, whereas condensin is composed of the structural maintenance of chromosomes proteins SMC2 and SMC4 and of three non-SMC subunits. Here we show that hHCP-6 becomes phosphorylated during mitosis and that its dephosphorylation by PP2A in vitro depends on B/PR55, suggesting that hHCP-6 is a B/PR55-specific substrate of PP2A. Unlike condensin, hHCP-6 is localized in the nucleus in interphase, but similar to condensin, hHCP-6 associates with chromosomes during mitosis. hHCP-6 is part of a complex that contains SMC2, SMC4, kleisin-beta, and the previously uncharacterized HEAT repeat protein FLJ20311. hHCP-6 is therefore part of a condensin-related complex that associates with chromosomes in mitosis and may be\ncbeta was co-expressed with PR65/A and co-purified as a core dimer, PP2AD (Aalpha/calpha and Aalpha/cbeta) with PR65alpha/Aalpha. The recombinant PP2AD bound to the B subunit in vitro. These results show that the recombinant PP2Acalpha and cbeta are identical in their ability to associate with the A and B subunits, in their phosphatase activities, and in carboxyl-methylation. Furthermore, our results show that High Five insect cells can produce biologically active recombinant PP2A, which should be a valuable tool for detecting natural toxins and investigating the mechanism of PP2A catalysis and other protein interactions. Two highly related regulatory subunits of PP2A exert opposite effects on TGF-beta/Activin/Nodal signalling. We identify Balpha (PPP2R2A) and Bdelta (PPP2R2D), two highly related members of the B family of regulatory subunits of the protein phosphatase PP2A, as important modulators of TGF-beta/Activin/Nodal signalling that affect the pathway in opposite ways. Knockdown of Balpha in Xenopus embryos or mammalian tissue\n60,900, 52,500, and 68,000, respectively. The proteins are 60-80% identical and differ mostly at their termini. Two of the isoforms, B' beta 3 and B' gamma, contain a bipartite nuclear localization signal in their COOH terminus. No homology was found with other B- or B- related subunits. Northern analyses indicate a tissue-specific expression of the isoforms. Expression of B' alpha protein in Escherichia coli generated a polypeptide of approximately 53 kDa, similar to the size of the B' subunit present in the purified PP2A0. The recombinant protein was recognized by antibody raised against native B' and interacted with the dimeric PP2A (A.C2) to generate a trimeric phosphatase. The deduced amino acid sequences of the B' isoforms show significant homology to mammalian, fungal, and plant nucleotide sequences of unknown function present in the data bases. Notably, a high degree of homology (55-66%) was found with a yeast gene, RTS1, encoding a\nthe specificity of beta-catenin dephosphorylation is regulated are not clear. In this study, we show that PP2A regulates beta-catenin phosphorylation and degradation in vivo. We demonstrate that PP2A is required for Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in Drosophila. Moreover, we have identified PR55 alpha as the regulatory subunit of PP2A that controls beta-catenin phosphorylation and degradation. PR55 alpha, but not the catalytic subunit, PP2Ac, directly interacts with beta-catenin. RNA interference knockdown of PR55 alpha elevates beta-catenin phosphorylation and decreases Wnt signaling, whereas overexpressing PR55 alpha enhances Wnt signaling. Taken together, our results suggest that PR55 alpha specifically regulates PP2A-mediated beta-catenin dephosphorylation and plays an essential role in Wnt signaling.

WIPI-Mediated Autophagy and Longevity. Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation process for cytoplasmic components, including organelles, membranes, and proteins, and critically secures eukaryotic cellular homeostasis and survival. Moreover, autophagy-related (ATG) genes are considered essential for longevity control in model organisms. Central to the regulatory relationship between autophagy and longevity is the control of insulin/insulin-like growth factor receptor-driven activation of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), which inhibits WIPI (WD repeat protein interacting with phosphoinositides)-mediated autophagosome formation. Release of the inhibitory mTOR action on autophagy permits\nbasis of aging. As the development of strategies on how to increase health span in humans is increasingly appreciated, we speculate that targeting WIPI protein function might represent a therapeutic opportunity to fight and delay the onset of age-related human diseases. Identification of Autophagy-Related Genes in the Progression from Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis. BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Autophagy plays a vital role in NAFLD development and progression. We aimed to establish a novel autophagy-related gene (ARG) signature as a therapeutic target in NAFLD patients based on high-throughput sequencing data.METHODS: ARGs obtained from the HAMdb and high-sequencing data obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were analyzed to identify differentially expressed ARGs (DEARGs) between normal and NASH tissues. Then, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were performed to explore potential\nas negative regulators of ULK1 activity. To address the role of ATG8 binding to ULK1, we mutated the LIR of endogenous ULK1 to disrupt the ATG8-ULK1 interaction by genome editing. The mutation drastically reduced the activity of ULK1, autophagic degradation of SQSTM1, and phagophore formation in response to starvation. The mutation also suppressed the formation and turnover of autophagosomes in response to starvation. Similar to the mutation of the ULK1 LIR, disruption of the ATG13-ATG8 interaction suppressed ULK1 activity and autophagosome formation. In contrast, RB1CC1 did not show any specific binding to ATG8s, and mutation of its LIR did not affect ULK1 activity. Together, this study demonstrates differential binding and opposite regulation of the ULK1 complex by GABARAPs and LC3s, and an important role of the ULK1- and ATG13-ATG8 interactions in autophagy induction.Abbreviations: ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATG7: autophagy related 7; ATG8: autophagy related 8; ATG13: autophagy related 13; ATG14:\nNASH tissues. Then, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were performed to explore potential biological and pathological functions of DEARGs. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the DEARGs was established through the STRING website, and visualized by Cytoscape. In addition, hub genes were validated by an independent dataset GSE89632. Finally, we performed Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) pathway-related analysis to identify the pivotal signaling pathways and genes for the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).RESULTS: A total of 76 DEARGs were identified in the GSE126848 dataset, of which 45 genes were upregulated and 31 genes were downregulated. GO analysis showed that the biological functions of DEARGs focused primarily on autophagy, cellular response to external stimulus, fibroblast proliferation, late endosome, and ubiquitin protein ligase binding. KEGG pathway analysis showed that these DEARGs were mainly involved in the apoptosis, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway,\nwhich inhibits WIPI (WD repeat protein interacting with phosphoinositides)-mediated autophagosome formation. Release of the inhibitory mTOR action on autophagy permits the production of PI3P (phosphatidylinositol-3 phosphate), predominantly at the endoplasmic reticulum, to function as an initiation signal for the formation of autophagosomes. WIPI proteins detect this pool of newly produced PI3P and function as essential PI3P effector proteins that recruit downstream autophagy-related (ATG) proteins. The important role of WIPI proteins in autophagy is highlighted by functional knockout of the WIPI homologues ATG-18 and EPG-6 in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Adult lifespan is significantly reduced in ATG-18 mutant animals, demonstrating that longevity as such is crucially determined by essential autophagy factors. In this review we summarize the role of WIPI proteins and their C. elegans homologues with regard to the molecular basis of aging. As the development of strategies on how to increase health span in humans is increasingly appreciated, we\nEvolutionary trends and functional anatomy of the human expanded autophagy network. All eukaryotic cells utilize autophagy for protein and organelle turnover, thus assuring subcellular quality control, homeostasis, and survival. In order to address recent advances in identification of human autophagy associated genes, and to describe autophagy on a system-wide level, we established an autophagy-centered gene interaction network by merging various primary data sets and by retrieving respective interaction data. The resulting network ('AXAN') was analyzed with respect to subnetworks, e.g. the prime gene subnetwork (including the core machinery, signaling pathways and autophagy receptors) and the transcription subnetwork. To describe aspects of evolution within this network, we assessed the presence of protein orthologs across 99 eukaryotic model organisms. We visualized evolutionary trends for prime gene categories and evolutionary tracks for selected AXAN genes. This analysis confirms the eukaryotic origin of autophagy core genes while it points to a diverse evolutionary history\nAXAN genes. This analysis confirms the eukaryotic origin of autophagy core genes while it points to a diverse evolutionary history of autophagy receptors. Next, we used module identification to describe the functional anatomy of the network at the level of pathway modules. In addition to obvious pathways (e.g., lysosomal degradation, insulin signaling) our data unveil the existence of context-related modules such as Rho GTPase signaling. Last, we used a tripartite, image-based RNAi - screen to test candidate genes predicted to play a role in regulation of autophagy. We verified the Rho GTPase, CDC42, as a novel regulator of autophagy-related signaling. This study emphasizes the applicability of system-wide approaches to gain novel insights into a complex biological process and to describe the human autophagy pathway at a hitherto unprecedented level of detail. GABARAPs and LC3s have opposite roles in regulating ULK1 for autophagy induction. ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1)\nmodeling, mutational analyses in cells and in vitro phosphoinositide-binding assays indicate that the WD40 repeat domain in human BCAS3 directly binds phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate. Furthermore, overexpression of the BCAS3-C16orf70 complex affects the recruitment of several core autophagy proteins to the phagophore assembly site. This study demonstrates regulatory roles for human BCAS3 and C16orf70 in autophagic activity.Abbreviations: AO: antimycin A and oligomycin; Ash: assembly helper; ATG: autophagy-related; BCAS3: BCAS3 microtubule associated cell migration factor; C16orf70: chromosome 16 open reading frame 70; DAPI: 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DKO: double knockout; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; fluoppi: fluorescent-based technology detecting protein-protein interactions; FIS1: fission, mitochondrial 1; FKBP: FKBP prolyl isomerase family member 1C; FRB: FKBP-rapamycin binding; hAG: humanized azami-green; IP: immunoprecipitation; IRES: internal ribosome entry site; KO: knockout; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MFN2: mitofusin 2; MS: mass spectrometry; MT-CO2: mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase II; mtDNA: mitochondrial DNA; OPTN: optineurin; PFA: paraformaldehyde;\nubiquitin protein ligase binding. KEGG pathway analysis showed that these DEARGs were mainly involved in the apoptosis, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and estrogen signaling pathway. Among DEGs, 9 most closely related genes were identified from the PPI network. Furthermore, NOS3, IGF1, VAMP8, FOS, and HMOX1 were verified in the GSE89632 dataset. At last, the MAPK signal pathway was identified as important pathway, and JUN was identified as a key gene involved in the progression from NAFL to NASH.CONCLUSION: This study may provide credible molecular biomarkers in terms of screening and diagnosis for NAFLD. Meanwhile, it also serves as a basis for exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of NAFL to NASH. Mammalian BCAS3 and C16orf70 associate with the phagophore assembly site in response to selective and non-selective autophagy.

GABARAPs and LC3s have opposite roles in regulating ULK1 for autophagy induction. ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) is the key mediator of MTORC1 signaling to macroautophagy/autophagy. ULK1 functions as a protein complex by interacting with ATG13, RB1CC1/FIP200, and ATG101. How the ULK1 complex is regulated to trigger autophagy induction remains unclear. In this study, we have determined roles of Atg8-family proteins (ATG8s) in regulating ULK1 activity and autophagy. Using human cells depleted of each subfamily of ATG8, we found that the GABARAP subfamily positively regulates ULK1 activity and phagophore and autophagosome formation in response to starvation. In contrast, the LC3 subfamily negatively regulates ULK1 activity and phagophore formation. By reconstituting ATG8-depleted cells with individual ATG8 members, we identified GABARAP and GABARAPL1 as positive and LC3B and LC3C as negative regulators of ULK1 activity. To address the role of ATG8 binding to ULK1, we mutated the LIR of\nMFN2: mitofusin 2; MS: mass spectrometry; MT-CO2: mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase II; mtDNA: mitochondrial DNA; OPTN: optineurin; PFA: paraformaldehyde; PE: phosphatidylethanolamine; PtdIns3K: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PtdIns3P: phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate; PtdIns(3,5)P2: phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate; PINK1: PTEN induced kinase 1; PRKN/Parkin: parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; PROPPIN: \u03b2-propellers that bind polyphosphoinositides; RB1CC1/FIP200: RB1 inducible coiled-coil 1; TOMM20: translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; WDR45B/WIPI3: WD repeat domain 45B; WDR45/WIPI4: WD repeat domain 45; WIPI: WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide interacting; WT: wild type; ZFYVE1/DFCP1: zinc finger FYVE-type containing 1.\nan intracellular degradation process that delivers cytosolic materials and/or damaged organelles to lysosomes. De novo synthesis of the autophagosome membrane occurs within a phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate-rich region of the endoplasmic reticulum, and subsequent expansion is critical for cargo encapsulation. This process is complex, especially in mammals, with many regulatory factors. In this study, by utilizing PRKN (parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase)-mediated mitochondria autophagy (mitophagy)-inducing conditions in conjunction with chemical crosslinking and mass spectrometry, we identified human BCAS3 (BCAS3 microtubule associated cell migration factor) and C16orf70 (chromosome 16 open reading frame 70) as novel proteins that associate with the autophagosome formation site during both non-selective and selective autophagy. We demonstrate that BCAS3 and C16orf70 form a complex and that their association with the phagophore assembly site requires both proteins. In silico structural modeling, mutational analyses in cells and in vitro phosphoinositide-binding assays indicate that the WD40 repeat domain in human BCAS3 directly",

However, when coexpressed with the cone photoreceptor alpha subunit, CNG6 induced a flickering channel gating, weakened the outward rectification in the presence of extracellular Ca(2+), increased the sensitivity for L-cis diltiazem, and enhanced the cAMP efficacy of the channel. Taken together, the data indicate that CNG6 represents a new CNG channel beta subunit that may associate with the CNG3 alpha subunit to form the native cone channel. Cyclic nucleotide-gated channel \u03b1-3 (CNGA3) interacts with stereocilia tip-link cadherin 23 + exon 68 or alternatively with myosin VIIa, two proteins required for hair cell mechanotransduction. Previously, we obtained evidence for a photoreceptor/olfactory type of CNGA3 transcript in a purified teleost vestibular hair cell preparation with immunolocalization of CNGA3 protein to stereocilia of teleost vestibular and mammalian cochlear hair cells. The carboxyl terminus of highly Ca(2+)-permeable CNGA3 expressed in the mammalian organ of Corti and saccular hair\nreplaced with arginine, cAMP-activated currents were enhanced 8-12-fold, suggesting that residue 596 influences channel gating. Thermodynamic cycle analysis of the data showed that (1) the residues are energetically coupled and (2) energetic coupling exists between the potentiating effects of Ni2+ and the replacement of F533 with tyrosine. These data suggest that changes in one of the residues alter the purine contacts with the other residues and that F533 communicates with the C-linker region of the channel involved in Ni2+ potentiation. Molecular cloning and functional characterization of a new modulatory cyclic nucleotide-gated channel subunit from mouse retina. Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels play a key role in olfactory and visual transduction. Native CNG channels are heteromeric complexes consisting of the principal alpha subunits (CNG1-3), which can form functional channels by themselves, and the modulatory beta subunits (CNG4-5). The individual alpha and beta subunits that combine to form the CNG channels in rod\nthe purine moiety alter ligand binding and channel gating in cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. Cytoplasmic cAMP and cGMP are soluble cellular messengers that directly activate cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels. These channels mediate sensory transduction in photoreceptors and olfactory neurons. The closely related CNG channels in these cell types have different nucleotide activation profiles, and we have investigated the molecular basis of their nucleotide selectivity properties. Previously, we predicted that the purine moiety of the nucleotide interacts with residues F533, K596, and D604 (bovine rod alpha CNG channel subunit sequences) of the nucleotide binding domain. In this study, we replaced these three residues with the corresponding residues of the bovine olfactory CNG channel. Mutations at each position altered the nucleotide activation of the rod CNG channels. In a mutant where K596 was replaced with arginine, cAMP-activated currents were enhanced 8-12-fold, suggesting that residue 596 influences channel gating. Thermodynamic cycle analysis of the\nexpression of the Modulatory subunit of the cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel. The cDNA of three variants of a cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel modulatory subunit (CNG4c-CNG4e) has been cloned. CNG4c, CNG4d, and CNG4e differ slightly from each other within an amino-terminal sequence that was originally reported as part of the bovine retinal glutamic acid-rich protein (GARP). The core region of CNG4 is homologous to the second subunit of the human rod photoreceptor channel (hRCNC2b), suggesting that both proteins are alternatively spliced products of the bovine and human homologue of the same gene. CNG4 transcripts are present in retina, testis, kidney, heart, and brain. Expression of CNG4 in HEK293 cells did not lead to detectable currents. Coexpression of CNG4 with the principal subunit of the bovine testis CNG channel (CNG3) resulted in currents which differed in several aspects from that induced by CNG3 alone. The heterooligomeric CNG3/CNG4 and the homooligomeric CNG3 channels\nsubunit with both of wild-type and mutant hCNGB3 subunits.CONCLUSIONS: The hCNGB3 plays an important modulatory role in the function of human cone CNG channels with respect to cGMP and extracellular Ca(2+) sensitivities. The rod monochromacy-associated S435F and D633G mutations in hCNGB3 evokes a significant increase in the apparent affinity for cGMP, which should alter cone function and thereby contribute at least partly to pathogenesis of the disease. Alternative splicing governs cone cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel sensitivity to regulation by phosphoinositides. Precursor mRNA encoding CNGA3 subunits of cone photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels undergoes alternative splicing, generating isoforms differing in the N-terminal cytoplasmic region of the protein. In humans, four variants arise from alternative splicing, but the functional significance of these changes has been a persistent mystery. Heterologous expression of the four possible CNGA3 isoforms alone or with CNGB3 subunits did not reveal significant differences in basic channel properties. However, inclusion\nbinds Ca(2+) with a concentration dependence that matches the calcium dependence of channel modulation. We conclude that CNG-modulin is the authentic Ca(2+)-dependent modulator of cone CNG channel ligand sensitivity. CNG-modulin is expressed in other tissues, such as brain, olfactory epithelium, and the inner ear, and may modulate the function of ion channels in those tissues as well. Retinal Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Channel Regulation by Calmodulin. Retinal cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channels bind to intracellular cGMP and mediate visual phototransduction in photoreceptor rod and cone cells. Retinal rod CNG channels form hetero-tetramers comprised of three CNGA1 and one CNGB1 protein subunits. Cone CNG channels are similar tetramers consisting of three CNGA3 and one CNGB3 subunits. Calmodulin (CaM) binds to two distinct sites (CaM1: residues 565-587 and CaM2: residues 1120-1147) within the cytosolic domains of rod CNGB1. The binding of Ca2+-bound CaM to CNGB1 promotes the Ca2+-induced desensitization of CNG channels in retinal\nouter segment disorganization was observed in some cones. Notably, CNGA3 protein and mRNA levels were significantly decreased in CNGB3(-/-) mice; in contrast, mRNA levels of S-opsin, Gnat2 and Pde6c were unchanged, relative to WT mice. Hence, we show that loss of CNGB3 reduces biosynthesis of CNGA3 and impairs cone CNG channel function. We suggest that down-regulation of CNGA3 contributes to the pathogenic mechanism by which CNGB3 mutations lead to human cone disease. Native cone photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated channel is a heterotetrameric complex comprising both CNGA3 and CNGB3: a study using the cone-dominant retina of Nrl-/- mice. Cone vision mediated by photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel activation is essential for central and color vision and visual acuity. Mutations in genes encoding the cone CNG channel subunits, CNGA3 and CNGB3, have been linked to various forms of achromatopsia and progressive cone dystrophy in humans. This study investigates the biochemical components of native\nand by phosphorylation. Other factors may also be involved in channel regulation. Mutations in CNG channel genes give rise to retinal degeneration and color blindness. In particular, mutations in the A and B subunits of the CNG channel expressed in human cones cause various forms of complete and incomplete achromatopsia. Mutations in CNGA3 impair trafficking or function of cone cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, resulting in achromatopsia. CNGA3 encodes the A-subunit of the cone photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel, which is a crucial component of the phototransduction cascade in cone outer segments. Mutations in the CNGA3 gene have been associated with complete and incomplete forms of achromatopsia (ACHR), a congenital, autosomal recessively inherited retinal disorder characterized by lack of color discrimination, reduced visual acuity, nystagmus, and photophobia. Here we report the identification of three novel CNGA3 missense mutations in ACHR patients: c.682G>A (p.E228 K), c.1315C>T (p.R439W), and c.1405G>A (p.A469 T), and the\nsingle stereocilia tip link. Cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels. Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels are nonselective cation channels first identified in retinal photoreceptors and olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). They are opened by the direct binding of cyclic nucleotides, cAMP and cGMP. Although their activity shows very little voltage dependence, CNG channels belong to the superfamily of voltage-gated ion channels. Like their cousins the voltage-gated K+ channels, CNG channels form heterotetrameric complexes consisting of two or three different types of subunits. Six different genes encoding CNG channels, four A subunits (A1 to A4) and two B subunits (B1 and B3), give rise to three different channels in rod and cone photoreceptors and in OSNs. Important functional features of these channels, i.e., ligand sensitivity and selectivity, ion permeation, and gating, are determined by the subunit composition of the respective channel complex. The function of CNG channels has been firmly established in retinal photoreceptors and\ncoupling. Alternative splicing of CNGA3 occurs in multiple species, although the exact variants are not conserved across CNGA3 orthologs. Optional exon 3 appears to be unique to humans, even compared with other primates. In parallel, we found that a specific splice variant of canine CNGA3 removes a region of the protein that is necessary for high sensitivity to PIPn. CNGA3 alternative splicing may have evolved, in part, to tune the interactions between cone CNG channels and membrane-bound phosphoinositides. Two structural components in CNGA3 support regulation of cone CNG channels by phosphoinositides. Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels in retinal photoreceptors play a crucial role in vertebrate phototransduction. The ligand sensitivity of photoreceptor CNG channels is adjusted during adaptation and in response to paracrine signals, but the mechanisms involved in channel regulation are only partly understood. Heteromeric cone CNGA3 (A3) + CNGB3 (B3) channels are inhibited by membrane phosphoinositides (PIP(n)), including phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate\nR439W, A469 T, F547L, and E590 K. We could show that several mutant channels with agonist dose-response relationships similar to the wild-type exhibited severely impaired membrane targeting. In addition, this study presents the positive effect of reduced cell culture temperature on surface expression and functional performance of mutant CNG channels with protein folding or trafficking defects. Functional role of hCngb3 in regulation of human cone cng channel: effect of rod monochromacy-associated mutations in hCNGB3 on channel function. PURPOSE: The human cone photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel comprises alpha- and beta-subunits, which are respectively encoded by hCNGA3 and hCNGB3. The purpose was to examine the functional role of hCNGB3 in modulation of human cone CNG channels and to characterize functional consequences of rod monochromacy-associated mutations in hCNGB3 (S435F and D633G).METHODS: Macroscopic patch currents were recorded from human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressing homomeric (hCNGA3 and hCNGB3) and heteromeric (hCNGA3/hCNGB3, hCNGA3/hCNGB3-S435F,\ncomplexes, in a concentration- and time-dependent pattern. Thus this work provides the first biochemical evidence showing the inter-subunit interaction between CNGA3 and CNGB3 and the presence of heterotetrameric complexes of the native cone CNG channel in retina. No association between CNGA3 and the cone Na(+)/Ca(2+)-K(+) exchanger (NCKX2) was shown by co-immunoprecipitation and chemical cross-linking. This may implicate a distinct modulatory mechanism for Ca(2+) homeostasis in cones compared to rods. The glutamic acid-rich protein is a gating inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. The cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) cation channel of rod photoreceptors is a heterotetramer consisting of homologous CNGA1 and CNGB1a subunits. While CNGA1 is indispensable for channel activation, the specific role of CNGB1a in this process has remained elusive. Here, we show that the N-terminal glutamic acid-rich protein (GARP) domain of CNGB1a and soluble GARP2, which corresponds to the proximal portion of the GARP domain, act as autoinhibitory domains that decrease\nA cyclic nucleotide-gated channel mutation associated with canine daylight blindness provides insight into a role for the S2 segment tri-Asp motif in channel biogenesis. Cone cyclic nucleotide-gated channels are tetramers formed by CNGA3 and CNGB3 subunits; CNGA3 subunits function as homotetrameric channels but CNGB3 exhibits channel function only when co-expressed with CNGA3. An aspartatic acid (Asp) to asparagine (Asn) missense mutation at position 262 in the canine CNGB3 (D262N) subunit results in loss of cone function (daylight blindness), suggesting an important role for this aspartic acid residue in channel biogenesis and/or function. Asp 262 is located in a conserved region of the second transmembrane segment containing three Asp residues designated the Tri-Asp motif. This motif is conserved in all CNG channels. Here we examine mutations in canine CNGA3 homomeric channels using a combination of experimental and computational approaches. Mutations of these conserved Asp residues result in the absence of nucleotide-activated\ncalcium in response to agonist, when expressed either alone or together with the wild-type CNGB3 subunit in HEK293 cells, was completely abolished due to p.Cys319Arg variant. Western blotting and immunolocalization studies suggest that a decreased channel density in the HEK293 cell membrane due to impaired folding and/or trafficking of the CNGA3 protein is the main pathogenic effect of the p.Cys319Arg variant. Mutant alleles of the human cone photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNGA3) are frequently associated with achromatopsia. In rare cases, variants in CNGA3 are also associated with cone dystrophy, Leber's congenital amaurosis and oligo cone trichromacy. The identification of predicted p.(Cys319Arg) missense variant in CNGA3 expands the repertoire of the known genetic causes of CRD and phenotypic spectrum of CNGA3 alleles. Three residues predicted by molecular modeling to interact with the purine moiety alter ligand binding and channel gating in cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. Cytoplasmic cAMP and cGMP are soluble cellular\ndomains of rod CNGB1. The binding of Ca2+-bound CaM to CNGB1 promotes the Ca2+-induced desensitization of CNG channels in retinal rods that may be important for photoreceptor light adaptation. Mutations that affect Ca2+-dependent CNG channel function are responsible for inherited forms of blindness. In this review, we propose structural models of the rod CNG channel bound to CaM that suggest how CaM might cause channel desensitization and how dysregulation of the channel may lead to retinal disease. Canine CNGA3 Gene Mutations Provide Novel Insights into Human Achromatopsia-Associated Channelopathies and Treatment. Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channels are key mediators underlying signal transduction in retinal and olfactory receptors. Genetic defects in CNGA3 and CNGB3, encoding two structurally related subunits of cone CNG channels, lead to achromatopsia (ACHM). ACHM is a congenital, autosomal recessive retinal disorder that manifests by cone photoreceptor dysfunction, severely reduced visual acuity, impaired or complete color blindness and photophobia.\nthe modulatory beta subunits (CNG4-5). The individual alpha and beta subunits that combine to form the CNG channels in rod photoreceptors (CNG1 + CNG4) and olfactory neurons (CNG2 + CNG4 + CNG5) have been characterized. In contrast, only an alpha subunit (CNG3) has been identified so far in cone photoreceptors. Here we report the molecular cloning of a new CNG channel subunit (CNG6) from mouse retina. The cDNA of CNG6 encodes a peptide of 694 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 80 kDa. Among the CNG channel subunits, CNG6 has the highest overall similarity to the CNG4 beta subunit (47% sequence identity). CNG6 transcripts are present in a small subset of retinal photoreceptor cells and also in testis. Heterologous expression of CNG6 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells did not lead to detectable currents. However, when coexpressed with the cone photoreceptor alpha subunit, CNG6 induced a flickering channel\nof CNGB1a. In conclusion, we propose that the N terminus of CNGB1a and soluble GARPs act as molecular gate keepers that control the activation of heteromeric rod CNG channels. Our results suggest that the GARP domain has evolved in rod photoreceptors to reduce current noise resulting from openings of CNG channels in the absence of cGMP. CNG-modulin: a novel Ca-dependent modulator of ligand sensitivity in cone photoreceptor cGMP-gated ion channels. The transduction current in several different types of sensory neurons arises from the activity of cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channels. The channels in these sensory neurons vary in structure and function, yet each one demonstrates calcium-dependent modulation of ligand sensitivity mediated by the interaction of the channel with a soluble modulator protein. In cone photoreceptors, the molecular identity of the modulator protein was previously unknown. We report the discovery and characterization of CNG-modulin, a novel 301 aa protein that interacts\naltering the electrostatic equilibrium within in the S1-S4 bundle. Because residues analogous to Tri-Asp in the voltage-gated Shaker potassium channel family were implicated in monomer folding, we hypothesize that destabilizing these electrostatic interactions impairs the monomer folding state in D262N mutant CNG channels during biogenesis. Compound heterozygous CNGA3 mutations (R436W, L633P) in a Japanese patient with congenital achromatopsia. Congenital achromatopsia is a stationary retinal disorder with autosomal recessive inheritance that is characterized by loss of color discrimination, low visual acuity, photophobia, and nystagmus. This disorder has been shown to be associated with CNGA3, CNGB3, and GNAT2 mutations, and the frequency of mutations in the CNGA3 gene (encoding alpha subunit of the cone-specific cGMP-gated cation channel) was 23-33% in European populations. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that CNGA3 mutations are also responsible for congenital achromatopsia in Japanese patients. DNA from venous blood samples from a total\nthat regulation of A3 subunits by phosphoinositides exhibits two separable components, which depend on structural elements within the N- and C-terminal regions, respectively. Furthermore, both N and C regulatory modules in A3 supported PIP(n) regulation of heteromeric A3+B3 channels. B3 subunits were not sufficient to confer PIP(n) sensitivity to heteromeric channels formed with PIP(n)-insensitive A subunits. Finally, channels formed by mixtures of PIP(n)-insensitive A3 subunits, having complementary mutations in N- and/or C-terminal regions, restored PIP(n) regulation, implying that intersubunit N-C interactions help control the phosphoinositide sensitivity of cone CNG channels. Impaired cone function and cone degeneration resulting from CNGB3 deficiency: down-regulation of CNGA3 biosynthesis as a potential mechanism. The cone cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel is essential for central and color vision and visual acuity. This channel is composed of two structurally related subunits, CNGA3 and CNGB3; CNGA3 is the ion-conducting subunit, whereas CNGB3 is a modulatory subunit. Mutations in both\nthickness but a 20% decrease in parafoveal thickness. Ganzfeld full-field electroretinograms (ERGs) showed normal responses in rod and mixed rod-plus-cone ERGs but no response in cone or 30-Hz flicker ERGs. Spectral sensitivity on a white background revealed a curve with only one peak at around 500 nm, which fits the absorption spectrum of human rhodopsin. L633, conserved among vertebrate orthologs of human CNGA3, is a hydrophobic residue forming part of the carboxy-terminal leucine zipper (CLZ) domain, which is functionally important in the mediation of intracellular interactions. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a Japanese complete achromat with CNGA3 mutations, and of any patient with a missense mutation within the CLZ domain. The outcome suggests low frequency (7%, 1/14) of CNGA3 mutations in Japanese patients. Molecular cloning and expression of the Modulatory subunit of the cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel.

S3, C and D), consistent with the observation that abnormally accumulated COL-19::GFP as ERAD substrate decreased in overall abundance in tmem-131 mutants (Fig. 2). These results indicate that TMEM-131 is essential for mature collagen production, and its deficiency causes ER stress and UPR through abnormal accumulation of secreted proteins, including at least collagen COL-19, LON-3, and COL-101 in the ER. Evolutionarily conserved roles of TMEM131 family proteins for collagen secretion TMEM-131 has not been previously characterized, although it belongs to the highly evolutionarily conserved Pfam12371 (TMEM131_like) protein family. Its protein sequence is predicted by the program TOPCONS to contain two transmembrane segments, the first (i.e., signal peptide targeting to the ER) and second of which span a hydrophilic domain facing ER, endosomal lumen, or extracellular space, while the C-terminal part is predicted to localize in the cytosol (Fig. 3A).\nreduction of tmem-131 expression level (Fig. 1, D and E). tm6119 mutants exhibited abnormally elevated levels of hsp-4p::GFP that can be rescued by transgenic expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)\u2013tagged wild-type tmem-131 (Fig. 1F). In addition, high hsp-4p::GFP levels in tm6119 mutants or tmem-131 RNAi\u2013treated animals were completely suppressed by loss of function (LOF) of XBP-1 (Fig. 1, G to I), a transcription factor that drives a major branch of UPR in C. elegans. Loss of IRE-1, an ER transmembrane protein that senses ER stress, also prevented hsp-4p::GFP up-regulation in tm6119 mutants (Fig. 1I). Besides constitutively activated hsp-4p::GFP expression, we found that TMEM131-deficient animals by RNAi or tm6119 were smaller in size at higher temperature, more sensitive to the ER stressor tunicamycin as well as cuticle-disrupting osmotic stresses, and developed more slowly compared with wild type (fig. S1). Nonetheless, unlike hsp-4p::GFP, these additional phenotypes were not suppressed by loss of\nidentified host factor that regulates flavivirus replication, but the molecular mechanism is not fully understood. Here, using Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) as a model, we investigated the mechanism through which the host factor SPCS1 regulates the replication of flaviviruses. We first validated the regulatory function of SPCS1 in JEV propagation by knocking down and knocking out endogenous SPCS1. The loss of SPCS1 function markedly reduced intracellular virion assembly and the production of infectious JEV particles but did not affect cell entry, RNA replication, or translation of the virus. SPCS1 was found to interact with nonstructural protein 2B (NS2B), which is involved in posttranslational protein processing and virus assembly. Serial deletion mutation of the JEV NS2B protein revealed that two transmembrane domains, NS2B(1-49) and NS2B(84-131), interact with SPCS1. Further mutagenesis analysis of conserved flavivirus residues in two SPCS1 interaction domains of NS2B demonstrated that G12A, G37A, and G47A in NS2B(1-49) and\nJEV life cycle but not in the cell entry, genome RNA replication, or translation stages. Furthermore, we found that SPCS1 interacts with two independent transmembrane domains of the flavivirus NS2B protein. NS2B also interacts with NS2A, which is proposed to mediate virus assembly. Therefore, we propose a protein-protein interaction model showing how SPCS1 participates in the assembly of JEV particles. These findings expand our understanding of how host factors participate in the flavivirus replication life cycle and identify potential antiviral targets for combating flavivirus infection.\nof the C. elegans transgenic reporter asp-17p::GFP (Fig. 1A). asp-17 is a gene encoding an aspartyl protease\u2013like protein that is up-regulated by temperature stress and down-regulated by ER stress (Fig. 1, A to C). From a screen of over 19,100 genes, we identified 574 RNAi clones that either up- or down-regulated the abundance of asp-17p::GFP (table S1). In this work, we focus on the gene tmem-131, as it is uncharacterized but otherwise highly evolutionarily conserved in all animals (see below). RNAi against tmem-131 caused a fully penetrant and strong suppression of asp-17p::GFP reporter expression (Fig. 1B). By contrast, RNAi against tmem-131 caused marked up-regulation of hsp-4p::GFP (Fig. 1C), an established transcriptional reporter for ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) in C. elegans. The screen also identified many other genes, including ostb-1 and dlst-1, that are involved in protein modification and homeostasis in the ER (Fig. 1C). RNAi against ostb-1\nis a key component of TRAPP III, a subtype of TRAPP that acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) to activate Rab GTPase (guanosine triphosphatase) to promote ER-to-Golgi cargo trafficking. Most COPII vesicles are approximately 60 to 80 nm in diameter, insufficient to accommodate 300- to 400-nm procollagen fibers. Collagen maturation and secretion in large-cargo COPII require HSP47, a procollagen chaperone in the ER, and TANGO1, an ER transmembrane protein that facilitates the export of specialized bulky cargo with collagen. HSP47 and TANGO1 orthologs are not apparently present in collagen-producing Caenorhabditis elegans, raising the question whether more broadly conserved mechanisms exist to facilitate procollagen assembly into export-competent collagen trimers en route for secretion. In this study, we identify a previously uncharacterized C. elegans gene tmem-131 that defines an evolutionarily conserved protein family important for procollagen recruitment and secretion. The exoskeleton cuticle of C. elegans is a complex collagen matrix\nconserved protein family important for procollagen recruitment and secretion. The exoskeleton cuticle of C. elegans is a complex collagen matrix that contains many distinct mature collagen proteins, including COL-19, an adult-specific, epithelial synthesized collagen. From yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) screens, we identified two human proteins, COL1A2 and TRAPPC8, that bind to the N- and C-terminal domains of human TMEM131, respectively, and show that COL-19 secretion requires TMEM-131 and TRPP-8, the C. elegans ortholog of TRAPPC8. We show that TMEM131 proteins are also essential for collagen secretion in Drosophila and human cells, supporting the evolutionarily conserved role of TMEM131 protein family in collagen production. RESULTS Genome-wide RNAi screen identifies tmem-131 regulating ER stress response and collagen production in C. elegans We performed a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen for genes that affect levels of the C. elegans transgenic reporter asp-17p::GFP (Fig. 1A). asp-17 is a gene encoding an aspartyl protease\u2013like protein that is\nto secretory capacity by processing the XBP-1 mRNA XBP-1 is a cell-nonautonomous regulator of stress resistance and longevity Organismal regulation of XBP-1-mediated unfolded protein response during development and immune activation Physiological IRE-1-XBP-1 and PEK-1 signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans larval development and immunity SignalP 4.0: Discriminating signal peptides from transmembrane regions The cuticle of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans: A complex collagen structure Basement membrane sliding and targeted adhesion remodels tissue boundaries during uterine-vulval attachment in Caenorhabditis elegans Protein disulfide isomerase activity is essential for viability and extracellular matrix formation in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans Derlin-dependent retrograde transport from endosomes to the golgi apparatus TreeFam: 2008 Update Identification of TMEM131L as a novel regulator of thymocyte proliferation in humans Evolutionary conservation of Notch signaling inhibition by TMEM131L overexpression The TOPCONS web server for consensus prediction of membrane protein topology and signal peptides SWISS-MODEL: Homology modelling of protein structures and complexes Crystal structure\nof conserved flavivirus residues in two SPCS1 interaction domains of NS2B demonstrated that G12A, G37A, and G47A in NS2B(1-49) and P112A in NS2B(84-131) weakened the interaction with SPCS1. Deletion mutation of SPCS1 revealed that SPCS1(91-169), which contains two transmembrane domains, was involved in interactions with both NS2B(1-49) and NS2B(84-131). Taken together, these results demonstrate that SPCS1 affects viral replication by interacting with NS2B, thereby influencing the posttranslational processing of JEV proteins and the assembly of virions.IMPORTANCE Understanding virus-host interactions is important for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of virus propagation and identifying potential antiviral targets. Previous reports demonstrated that SPCS1 is involved in the flavivirus life cycle, but the mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we confirmed that SPCS1 participates in the posttranslational protein processing and viral assembly stages of the JEV life cycle but not in the cell entry, genome RNA replication, or translation stages. Furthermore, we found that SPCS1\nis required for collagen secretion and preventing ER stress in C. elegans. Within the evolutionarily conserved TMEM131_like protein family (Fig. 4A), the invertebrate model organisms C. elegans and Drosophila have one ortholog each, named tmem-131 and CG8370, respectively. Vertebrate genomes encode two paralogs of TMEM-131, e.g., TMEM131 and KIAA0922 (also known as TMEM131L) in humans (Fig. 4, A and B). PapD-L domains are predicted from each homolog and represent the most highly conserved parts of TMEM131_like family proteins, based on multiple sequence alignment analysis (Clustal Omega) (fig. S4A). We sought to identify conserved protein-interacting partners as the ligand or client proteins for Ce-PapD in TMEM131 and used a Y2H screen to search for human proteins that can bind to Ce-PapD (Fig. 4C). From a normalized human complementary DNA (cDNA) library with approximately 9 million yeast clones in the screen, the Ce-PapD bait cDNA yielded 34 Ce-PapD interactor-encoding prey clones, among\nidentify a C. elegans protein, TMEM-131, which has homologs in most animals, with essential roles in collagen secretion. These roles appear evolutionarily conserved for Drosophila and human TMEM131 homologs. We propose that TMEM131 proteins recruit premature collagen monomers through N-terminal PapD-L domains, whereas its C-terminal TRAPIDs bind to TRAPPC8, which promotes collagen secretion as a key component of TRAPP complex during the ER-to-Golgi transport of COPII vesicles (Fig. 7F). Although we did not recognize any apparent homologous C-propeptide protein sequence in C. elegans COL-19 or COL-101, their normal secretion still requires TMEM-131 as Drosophila, or human collagen I secretion requires TMEM131 homologs. Despite the lack of obvious sequence similarity between the C. elegans cuticle collagens and the COLFI domain of mammalian fibrillar collagens, TMEM131 family proteins appear to have evolved similar functions among different species. As COL-19::GFP secretion also requires C. elegans TRAPPC8 homolog, we propose that the interaction between\nBroadly conserved roles of TMEM131 family proteins in intracellular collagen assembly and secretory cargo trafficking Collagen production and secretion in cells of diverse organisms require a novel family of transmembrane proteins. Collagen is the most abundant protein in animals. Its dysregulation contributes to aging and many human disorders, including pathological tissue fibrosis in major organs. How premature collagen proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) assemble and route for secretion remains molecularly undefined. From an RNA interference screen, we identified an uncharacterized Caenorhabditis elegans gene tmem-131, deficiency of which impairs collagen production and activates ER stress response. We find that amino termini of human TMEM131 contain bacterial PapD chaperone\u2013like domains, which recruit premature collagen monomers for proper assembly and secretion. Carboxy termini of TMEM131 interact with TRAPPC8, a component of the TRAPP tethering complex, to drive collagen cargo trafficking from ER to the Golgi. We provide evidence that previously undescribed roles\northologs can be found in C. elegans. Compared with HSP47 or TANGO1, TMEM131 family proteins are evolutionarily more ancient, consistent with their broad requirements for collagen production in animals. In mammals, COL1A1/2 trimerization initiates from the C-propeptide domain, which can be replaced with a transmembrane domain without affecting trimer formation. This indicates that C-propeptide domains act by bringing procollagens close to ER membranes to facilitate procollagen assembly and secretion. Supporting this notion, we obtained evidence for direct COL1A2 binding to the ER-luminal TMEM131 PapD-L domain and notable collagen production defects of TMEM131-deficient cells. Additional PapD-L interactors identified from Y2H screens suggest possibly broader roles of TMEM131 beyond COL1A2 binding, although TMEM131 does appear to exhibit client-protein specificity as many other secreted proteins, including the type IV collagen EMB-9, were not affected by LOF of tmem-131 in C. elegans (table S2).

Over 50 animals were observed, with three shown to indicate representative reporter expression. Scale bars, 100 \u03bcm. To verify the RNAi phenotype, we examined C. elegans mutants carrying a 323\u2013base pair (bp) genetic deletion allele tm6119, which caused a protein-coding frameshift and severe reduction of tmem-131 expression level (Fig. 1, D and E). tm6119 mutants exhibited abnormally elevated levels of hsp-4p::GFP that can\nincluding ostb-1 and dlst-1, that are involved in protein modification and homeostasis in the ER (Fig. 1C). RNAi against ostb-1 or dlst-1, as tmem-131, also caused marked up-regulation of hsp-4p::GFP and down-regulation of asp-17p::GFP (Fig. 1C).

(E) Quantification of mRNA fold changes in tmem-131 and hsp-4::GFP expression levels in wild-type and tm6119\nthe overall mRNA abundance of tmem-131 (Fig. 3, C to F, and table S3). The phenotypes caused by tm6119 were rescued by the wild-type (100%, n = 20), but not the PapD-lacking (0%, n = 20), transgenes of tmem-131. We further analyzed COL-19::GFP proteins by Western blot analysis after separation of soluble versus insoluble fractions, which contain monomeric procollagens and multimerized/cross-linked collagens, respectively, from whole animal lysates. Consistent with the notion that secreted COL-19::GFP is cross-linked, thus insoluble, we found that both tm6119 and Ce-PapD deletion caused notable and robust decrease in the insoluble fractions of COL-19::GFP compared with wild type, while the abundance of soluble monomeric procollagens was less affected (Fig. 3G). These results indicate that Ce-PapD is essential for TMEM-131 to function in collagen recruitment and assembly, which is required for collagen secretion and preventing ER stress in C. elegans.

COL-19 is a C. elegans collagen protein that is secreted by the epithelial system and required for exoskeleton structure of the cuticle. COL-19::GFP deposition is enriched in the wild-type adult animal, constituting regular cuticle structures of annular furrows and lateral alae (Fig. 2, C and D). By contrast, cuticle COL-19::GFP is completely absent in the tm6119 mutant, with apparently missing COL-19::GFP\u2013marked annular furrows and\nassays (Fig. 4D).

Both COL1A1 and COL1A2 contain C-terminal domains (C-propeptide) responsible for initial chain trimerization in the ER. The trimerization occurs via a zipper-like mechanism, initiating from the C-propeptide domain of \u03b11/2 (I) in close proximity to ER membranes. Although the enzymes responsible for type I collagen modification, extracellular cleavage, and cross-linking have been well described, how procollagen monomers are recruited to assemble into secretion-competent multimers in the ER remains poorly understood. COPII-coated vesicles mediate ER-to-Golgi anterograde transport of secretion-competent cargos, including those containing collagens. Tethering COPII vesicles from ER to Golgi membranes requires TRAPP (transport protein particle), a multisubunit protein complex highly conserved in eukaryotes.

        "desc": "Binding Mechanism of GC7 to Deoxyhypusine Synthase in Sulfolobus solfataricus: A Thermophilic Model for the Design of New Hypusination Inhibitors. Translation factor 5A (eIF5A) is one of the most conserved proteins involved in protein synthesis. It plays a key role during the elongation of polypeptide chains, and its activity is critically dependent on hypusination, a post-translational modification of a specific lysine residue through two consecutive enzymatic steps carried out by deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS), with spermidine as substrate, and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH). It is well-established that eIF5A is overexpressed in several cancer types, and it is involved in various diseases such as HIV-1 infection, malaria, and diabetes; therefore, the development of inhibitors targeting both steps of the hypusination process is considered a promising and challenging therapeutic strategy. One of the most efficient inhibitors of the hypusination process is the spermidine analog N1-guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane (GC7). GC7 interacts in a specific binding pocket of\nof the modification enzymes toward the substrate protein. The specificity of the interaction between eIF5A and DOHH was investigated using human eIF5A (eIF5A-1 isoform) and human recombinant DOHH. DOHH displayed a strong preference for binding the deoxyhypusine-containing form of eIF5A, over the eIF5A precursor or the hypusine-containing eIF5A, indicating a role for the deoxyhypusine residue in binding. In addition to the deoxyhypusine residue, a large portion of the eIF5A polypeptide (>20-90 amino acids) is required for effective modification by DOHH. We have identified the amino acid residues of DOHH that are critical for substrate binding by alanine substitution of 36 conserved amino acid residues. Of these, alanine substitution at Glu57, Glu90, Glu208, Glu241, Gly63, or Gly214 caused a severe impairment in eIF5A(Dhp) binding, with a complete loss of binding and activity in the E57A and E208A mutant enzymes. Only aspartate substitution mutants, E57D or E208D, retained partial activity and substrate\nprotein response (UPR). Given the pleiotropic functions of eIF5A and by extension the hypusination enzymes, this system is being considered as a target for a range of cancers including multiple myeloma, B-Cell lymphoma, and neuroblastoma. In this review, we explore the role of eIF5A and discuss the therapeutic strategies that are currently developing both in the pre- and the clinical stage. Specificity of the deoxyhypusine hydroxylase-eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF5A) interaction: identification of amino acid residues of the enzyme required for binding of its substrate, deoxyhypusine-containing eIF5A. Deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH) is a novel metalloenzyme that catalyzes the final step of the post-translational synthesis of hypusine (Nepsilon-(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)lysine) in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A). Hypusine synthesis is unique in that it occurs in only one protein, denoting the strict specificity of the modification enzymes toward the substrate protein. The specificity of the interaction between eIF5A and DOHH was investigated using\nof the dinuclear iron enzyme deoxyhypusine hydroxylase. Although cells express hundreds of metalloenzymes, the mechanisms by which apoenzymes receive their metal cofactors are largely unknown. Poly(rC)-binding proteins PCBP1 and PCBP2 are multifunctional adaptor proteins that bind iron and deliver it to ferritin for storage or to prolyl and asparagyl hydroxylases to metallate the mononuclear iron center. Here, we show that PCBP1 and PCBP2 also deliver iron to deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH), the dinuclear iron enzyme required for hypusine modification of the translation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 5A. Cells depleted of PCBP1 or PCBP2 exhibited loss of DOHH activity and loss of the holo form of the enzyme in cells, particularly when cells were made mildly iron-deficient. Lysates containing PCBP1 and PCBP2 converted apo-DOHH to holo-DOHH in vitro with greater efficiency than lysates lacking PCBP1 or PCBP2. PCBP1 bound to DOHH in iron-treated cells but not in control or iron-deficient cells. Depletion\nregulates the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer. Deregulation of protein synthesis is a hallmark of cancer cell proliferation, survival, and metastatic progression. eIF5A1 and its highly related isoform eIF5A2 are translation initiation factors that have been implicated in a range of human malignancies, but how they control cancer development and disease progression is still poorly understood. Here, we investigated how eIF5A proteins regulate pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) pathogenesis. eIF5A proteins are the only known proteins regulated by a distinct posttranslational modification termed hypusination, which is catalyzed by two enzymes, deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH). The highly selective nature of the hypusine modification and its amenability to pharmacologic inhibition make eIF5A proteins attractive therapeutic targets. We found that the expression and hypusination of eIF5A proteins are upregulated in human PDAC tissues and in premalignant pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia tissues isolated from Pdx-1-Cre: LSL-KRAS(G12D) mice. Knockdown of eIF5A proteins in PDAC cells\nhypusination modification. Ischemic stroke remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, thereby highlighting the urgent necessary to identify new therapeutic targets. Deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH) is a fundamental enzyme catalyzing a unique posttranslational hypusination modification of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) and is highly involved in the progression of several human diseases, including HIV-1 infection, cancer, malaria, and diabetes. However, the potential therapeutic role of pharmacological regulation of DOHH in ischemic stroke is still poorly understood. Our study first discovered a natural small-molecule brazilin (BZ) with an obvious neuroprotective effect against oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion insult. Then, DOHH was identified as a crucial cellular target of BZ using HuProt\u2122 human proteome microarray. By selectively binding to the Cys232 residue, BZ induced a previously undisclosed allosteric effect to significantly increase DOHH catalytic activity. Furthermore, BZ-mediated DOHH activation amplified mitophagy for mitochondrial function and morphology maintenance via DOHH/eIF5A hypusination signaling pathway, thereby\ndisplacement from its active site. The unique amino acid hypusine is formed exclusively in eIF5A by the successive action of deoxyhypusine synthase and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (yeast Lia1, human DOHH). Although the first enzyme has been extensively studied, both Lia1 structure and the mechanism of action remain unclear. Hence, a multi-approach was used to evaluate Lia1 catalysis, metal/substrate binding, structural conformation and stability. Mutational analyses of Lia1 revealed fine differences in the mode of substrate binding between the human and yeast counterparts. Like human DOHH, recombinant Lia1 is an iron metalloenzyme. Iron is essential for enzyme activity since its loss renders the enzyme totally inactive. The separation of iron-free and iron-bound forms by gel filtration and native electrophoresis suggests differences in Lia1 tertiary structure related to the iron binding. The ability of Lia1 to undergo conformational changes prompted us to use a set of complementary spectroscopic approaches and SAXS to obtain\nduring the elongation process is of considerable interest in this regard. Overexpression of eIF5A has been linked with the development of a variety of cancers and inhibitors of the molecule have been proposed for anti-cancer clinical applications. eIF5A is the only protein in the cell that contains the post-translational modification hypusine. Hypusination is a two-step enzymatic process catalysed by the Deoxyhypusine Synthase (DHPS) and Deoxyhypusine Hydroxylase (DOHH). In addition, eIF5A can be acetylated by p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) which leads to translocation of the protein to the nucleus and its deactivation. In addition to the nucleus, eIF5A has been found in the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with eIF5A localisation related to function from regulation of mitochondrial activity and apoptosis to maintenance of ER integrity and control of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Given the pleiotropic functions of eIF5A and by extension the hypusination enzymes, this system is being considered\naIF5A hypusination in contrast to the established effect on eukaryotic cellular growth. These results provide, for the first time, detailed molecular insights into the binding mechanism of GC7 to aDHS generating the basis for the design of new and more specific DHS inhibitors. Hypusine, a polyamine-derived amino acid critical for eukaryotic translation. The natural amino acid hypusine (N\u03f5-4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl(lysine)) is derived from the polyamine spermidine, and occurs only in a single family of cellular proteins, eukaryotic translation factor 5A (eIF5A) isoforms. Hypusine is formed by conjugation of the aminobutyl moiety of spermidine to a specific lysine residue of this protein. The posttranslational synthesis of hypusine involves two enzymatic steps, catalyzed by deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH). Hypusine is essential for eIF5A activity. Inactivation of either the eIF5A or the DHPS gene is lethal in yeast and mouse, underscoring the vital role of eIF5A hypusination in eukaryotic cell growth and\ntissues and in premalignant pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia tissues isolated from Pdx-1-Cre: LSL-KRAS(G12D) mice. Knockdown of eIF5A proteins in PDAC cells inhibited their growth in vitro and orthotopic tumor growth in vivo, whereas amplification of eIF5A proteins increased PDAC cell growth and tumor formation in mice. Small-molecule inhibitors of DHPS and DOHH both suppressed eIF5A hypusination, preventing PDAC cell growth. Interestingly, we found that eIF5A proteins regulate PDAC cell growth by modulating the expression of PEAK1, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase essential for PDAC cell growth and therapy resistance. Our findings suggest that eIF5A proteins utilize PEAK1 as a downstream effector to drive PDAC pathogenesis and that pharmacologic inhibition of the eIF5A-hypusine-PEAK1 axis may provide a novel therapeutic strategy to combat this deadly disease. Iron chaperones PCBP1 and PCBP2 mediate the metallation of the dinuclear iron enzyme deoxyhypusine hydroxylase. Although cells express hundreds of metalloenzymes, the mechanisms by which apoenzymes receive their\nhypusine, an unusual amino acid essential for the function of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), which promotes tumor growth. We consequently validated DOHH overexpression in STS samples by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry. We further showed robust inhibition of proliferation, migration and invasion of GB cells following silencing of DOHH with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or inhibition of its activity with small molecules, ciclopirox and deferiprone. Moreover, DOHH silencing led to significant inhibition of tumor progression and prolonged survival in GB mouse models. Searching for a potential mechanism by which DOHH promotes tumor aggressiveness, we found that it supports the transition of GB cells to a more invasive phenotype via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related pathways. Evidence for conformational changes in the yeast deoxyhypusine hydroxylase Lia1 upon iron displacement from its active site. The unique amino acid hypusine is formed exclusively in eIF5A by the successive action of\nactivity in the E57A and E208A mutant enzymes. Only aspartate substitution mutants, E57D or E208D, retained partial activity and substrate binding, whereas alanine, glutamine, or asparagine mutants did not. These findings support a proposed model of DOHH-eIF5A binding in which the amino group(s) of the deoxyhypusine side chain of the substrate is primarily anchored by gamma-carboxyl groups of Glu57 and Glu208 at the DOHH active site.\nBlocking eIF5A modification in cervical cancer cells alters the expression of cancer-related genes and suppresses cell proliferation. Cancer etiology is influenced by alterations in protein synthesis that are not fully understood. In this study, we took a novel approach to investigate the role of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF5A in human cervical cancers, where it is widely overexpressed. eIF5A contains the distinctive amino acid hypusine, which is formed by a posttranslational modification event requiring deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH), an enzyme that can be inhibited by the drugs ciclopirox and deferiprone. We found that proliferation of cervical cancer cells can be blocked by DOHH inhibition with either of these pharmacologic agents, as well as by RNA interference-mediated silencing of eIF5A, DOHH, or another enzyme in the hypusine pathway. Proteomic and RNA analyses in HeLa cervical cancer cells identified two groups of proteins in addition to eIF5A that were coordinately affected by\nanalyses in HeLa cervical cancer cells identified two groups of proteins in addition to eIF5A that were coordinately affected by ciclopirox and deferiprone. Group 1 proteins (Hsp27, NM23, and DJ-1) were downregulated at the translational level, whereas group 2 proteins (TrpRS and PRDX2) were upregulated at the mRNA level. Further investigations confirmed that eIF5A and DOHH are required for Hsp27 expression in cervical cancer cells and for regulation of its key target I\u03baB and hence NF-\u03baB. Our results argue that mature eIF5A controls a translational network of cancer-driving genes, termed the eIF5A regulon, at the levels of mRNA abundance and translation. In coordinating cell proliferation, the eIF5A regulon can be modulated by drugs such as ciclopirox or deferiprone, which might be repositioned to control cancer cell growth. Insights Into the Binding Mechanism of GC7 to Deoxyhypusine Synthase in Sulfolobus solfataricus: A Thermophilic Model for the Design of New Hypusination Inhibitors.\nDHPS gene is lethal in yeast and mouse, underscoring the vital role of eIF5A hypusination in eukaryotic cell growth and animal development. The long and basic side chain of the hypusine residue promotes eIF5A-mediated translation elongation by facilitating peptide bond formation at polyproline stretches and at many other ribosome-pausing sites. It also enhances translation termination by stimulating peptide release. By promoting translation, the hypusine modification of eIF5A provides a key link between polyamines and cell growth regulation. eIF5A has been implicated in several human pathological conditions. Recent genetic data suggest that eIF5A haploinsufficiency or impaired deoxyhypusine synthase activity is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in humans. Deoxyhypusine hydroxylase: A novel therapeutic target differentially expressed in short-term vs long-term survivors of glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GB) is the most aggressive neoplasm of the brain. Poor prognosis is mainly attributed to tumor heterogeneity, invasiveness and drug resistance. Only a small fraction of GB patients survives\nPoor prognosis is mainly attributed to tumor heterogeneity, invasiveness and drug resistance. Only a small fraction of GB patients survives longer than 24 months from the time of diagnosis (ie, long-term survivors [LTS]). In our study, we aimed to identify molecular markers associated with favorable GB prognosis as a basis to develop therapeutic applications to improve patients' outcome. We have recently assembled a proteogenomic dataset of 87 GB clinical samples of varying survival rates. Following RNA-seq and mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics analysis, we identified several differentially expressed genes and proteins, including some known cancer-related pathways and some less established that showed higher expression in short-term (<6 months) survivors (STS) compared to LTS. One such target found was deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH), which is known to be involved in the biosynthesis of hypusine, an unusual amino acid essential for the function of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), which promotes tumor\nlysates lacking PCBP1 or PCBP2. PCBP1 bound to DOHH in iron-treated cells but not in control or iron-deficient cells. Depletion of PCBP1 or PCBP2 had no effect on the cytosolic Fe-S cluster enzyme xanthine oxidase but led to loss of cytosolic aconitase activity. Loss of aconitase activity was not accompanied by gain of RNA-binding activity, a pattern suggesting the incomplete disassembly of the [4Fe-4S] cluster. PCBP depletions had minimal effects on total cellular iron, mitochondrial iron levels, and heme synthesis. Thus, PCBP1 and PCBP2 may serve as iron chaperones to multiple classes of cytosolic nonheme iron enzymes and may have a particular role in restoring metal cofactors that are spontaneously lost in iron deficient cells. Deoxyhypusine hydroxylase as a novel pharmacological target for ischemic stroke via inducing a unique post-translational hypusination modification. Ischemic stroke remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, thereby highlighting the urgent necessary to identify\ncatalytic activity. Furthermore, BZ-mediated DOHH activation amplified mitophagy for mitochondrial function and morphology maintenance via DOHH/eIF5A hypusination signaling pathway, thereby protecting against ischemic neuronal injury in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our study first identified DOHH as a previously unreported therapeutic target for ischemic stroke, and provided a future drug design direction for DOHH allosteric activators using BZ as a novel molecular template. The pleiotropic roles of eIF5A in cellular life and its therapeutic potential in cancer. Protein synthesis is dysregulated in the majority of cancers and this process therefore provides a good therapeutic target. Many novel anti-cancer agents are directed to target the initiation stage of translation, however, translation elongation also holds great potential as a therapeutic target. The elongation factor eIF5A that assists the formation of peptidyl bonds during the elongation process is of considerable interest in this regard. Overexpression of eIF5A has been linked with the development\nefficient inhibitors of the hypusination process is the spermidine analog N1-guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane (GC7). GC7 interacts in a specific binding pocket of the DHS completely blocking its activity; however, its therapeutic use is limited by poor selectivity and restricted bioavailability. Here we have performed a comparative study between human DHS (hDHS) and archaeal DHS from crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (aDHS) to understand the structural and dynamical features of the GC7 inhibition. The advanced metadynamics (MetaD) classical molecular dynamics simulations show that the GC7 interaction is less stable in the thermophilic enzyme compared to hDHS that could underlie a lower inhibitory capacity of the hypusination process in Sulfolobus solfataricus. To confirm this hypothesis, we have tested GC7 activity on S. solfataricus by measuring cellular growth, and results have shown the lack of inhibition of aIF5A hypusination in contrast to the established effect on eukaryotic cellular growth. These results provide, for the first time, detailed\nof Lia1 to undergo conformational changes prompted us to use a set of complementary spectroscopic approaches and SAXS to obtain detailed information on the processes underlying dissociation of iron from Lia1 at different levels of the protein organization. The additive effect of weak interactions, especially within the metal center, resulted in an active enzyme in a stabilized and compact three-dimensional fold. Loss of tertiary contacts upon iron displacement led to an elongated conformation of Lia1, in which the N- and C-terminal domains are no longer in close proximity to guarantee the proper orientation of the active groups within the active site pocket. Our results demonstrate an essential structural role for iron binding in addition to its contribution to the catalysis of hypusine formation in the eIF-5A precursor. A hypusine-eIF5A-PEAK1 switch regulates the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer. Deregulation of protein synthesis is a hallmark of cancer cell proliferation, survival, and metastatic",

Although understanding the mechanisms that control P2X7 receptor levels in neuroblastoma cells could be biologically and clinically relevant, the intracellular signaling pathways involved in this regulation remain poorly understood. Here we show that (E)-2-benzylidene-3-(cyclohexylamino)-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-one (BCI), an allosteric inhibitor of dual specificity phosphatases (DUSP) 1 and 6, enhances the expression of P2X7 receptor in N2a neuroblastoma cells. We found that exposure to BCI induces the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and JNK, while it prevents the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. BCI enhanced dual specificity phosphatase 1 expression, whereas it induced a decrease in the dual specificity phosphatase 6 transcripts, suggesting that BCI-dependent inhibition of dual specificity phosphatase 1 may be responsible for the increase in p38 and JNK phosphorylation. The weaker ERK phosphorylation induced by BCI was reversed by p38 inhibition, indicating that this MAPK is involved in\nSsu72 with multiple factors results in dynamic structural plasticity in the CTD phosphorylation pattern. The failure of such interactions can cause inaccurate transcription cycles. Therefore, Ssu72 is indispensable for the establishment of the \u2018CTD code\u2019, by which the combination of CTD modifications generates numerous specific interactive surfaces. 2.2. 3\u2032-end Cleavage and Polyadenylation by Ssu72 Phosphatase 2.2.1. mRNA 3\u2032-end Processing Both 3\u2032-end cleavage and polyadenylation require a cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor complex (CPSF in humans; CPF in yeast). CPF can recognize signal peptides (AAUAAA) and induce the binding of cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) to form a protein complex at the 3\u2019-end. CPF can also stabilize poly (A) polymerase by binding to signal peptides. Recently, the protein compositions of the CPF complex have been clearly identified. Both CPF and CPSF contain three subunits: a poly (A) polymerase, a nuclease, and a phosphatase subunit. In yeast, the poly (A) polymerase subunit comprises\n1 (mTORC1) inhibition in combination with the dual phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/mTOR or AKT kinase inhibitors are more effective in inhibiting the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and cap-dependent translation. Dual targeting of the Akt and mTOR signaling pathways regulates cellular growth, proliferation and survival. Like the Cdc2-like kinases (CLK), dual-specific tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKs) are essential for the regulation of cell fate. The crosstalk between dual-specific phosphatases and dual- specific protein kinases is a novel drug target for anti-cancer therapy. Therefore, the focus of this chapter involves protein kinase modules, critical biochemical checkpoints of cancer therapy and the synergistic effects of protein kinases and anti-cancer molecules.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are the main regulators of cellular proliferation, growth, and survival in physiological or pathological conditions. Aberrant MAPK signaling plays\nin malignant melanoma depending on the histological subtype of the cancer. Loss- or gain-of-function effects of DUSP6 in these cancers highlights the significance of this phosphatase in carcinogenesis. Development of methods that use the DUSP6 gene as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment or as a prognostic factor for diagnosis and evaluation of cancer treatment outcome has great potential. This review focuses on molecular characteristics of the DUSP6 gene and its role in cancers in the purview of development, progression, and cancer treatment outcome. Specific interaction of the CD45 protein-tyrosine phosphatase with tyrosine-phosphorylated CD3 zeta chain. The CD45 transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase, EC 3.1.3.48) plays an essential role in T-cell activation by activating the Lck and/or Fyn protein-tyrosine kinases. However, numerous experiments have indicated that CD45 may have both stimulatory and inhibitory roles in T-cell activation. Thus, it is unlikely that the two kinases are the sole substrates of the\nthe phosphatase activity of Ssu72 Genetic interactions and transcriptomics implicate fission yeast CTD prolyl isomerase Pin1 as an agent of RNA 3\u2019 processing and transcription termination that functions via its effects on CTD phosphatase Ssu72 An unexpected binding mode for a Pol II CTD peptide phosphorylated at Ser7 in the active site of the CTD phosphatase Ssu72 The RNA polymerase II CTD \u201corphan\u201d residues: Emerging insights into the functions of Tyr-1, Thr-4, and Ser-7 Chemical tools to decipher regulation of phosphatases by proline isomerization on eukaryotic RNA polymerase II Structure and mechanism of the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery A physiological role for gene loops in yeast Promoter-terminator gene loops affect alternative 3\u2019-end processing in yeast A transcription-independent role for TFIIB in gene looping Transcription-dependent gene looping of the HIV-1 provirus is dictated by recognition of pre-mRNA processing signals Non-coding RNA: It\u2019s not junk Gene loops enhance transcriptional directionality SMC\nTo determine if signalling proteins bind c-Src in chromaffin cells, we examined c-Src immunocomplexes for co-precipitating proteins. We discovered a phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTPase; EC 3.1.3.48) activity which associates with specific subcellular pools of c-Src in vivo and which preferentially binds the SH2 (Src homology 2) domain of c-Src in vitro. Known PTPases were not identified by blotting of c-Src immunocomplexes with a panel of anti-PTPase antibodies, suggesting that the PTPase may be a novel family member. The c-Src-PTPase complex is enriched in the plasma membrane fraction and exists in several large complexes, as revealed by gel-filtration analysis. This PTPase activity is altered rapidly following stimulation by secretagogues, decreasing within 30 s and returning to basal levels by 60 s of stimulation. Both the subcellular localization and rapid activity changes suggest that the c-Src-associated PTPase may function in early signalling events emanating from the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. In support of this\n(Ser5P) and Serine 7 (Ser7P) of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII. Ssu72 contains the cysteine-X(5)-arginine (CX5R) signature motif of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases). Mutations of Cys residues can lead to the loss of Ssu72\u2032s phosphatase activity. In addition, aspartate loops in the active site of Ssu72 seem to be essential for maintaining the phosphatase activity of Ssu72. Ssu72 has a dual function in transcriptional biogenesis by interacting with many kinases and/or phosphatases and multiple transcription factors. It has been reported that Ssu72 can enhance a TFIIB defect in yeast and facilitate the assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex (PIC), which is important for accurate start site selection. Ssu72 influences PIC formation and stability by cooperating with RNAPII subunits and other kinases/phosphatases to regulate transcriptional transition. Additionally, Ssu72 can regulate the 3\u2032-end processing of nascent mRNA and gene looping. 2.1. Ssu72 Acts as an RNA Polymerase II CTD Phosphatase in\ntumor suppressors. Besides selective tyrosine dephosphorylation of PTKs via PTPs may affect oncogenic pathways during carcinogenesis. The PTP family contains a group of dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) that regulate the activity of Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which are key effectors in the control of cell growth, proliferation and survival. Abnormal MAPK signaling is critical for initiation and progression stages of carcinogenesis. Since depletion of DUSP-MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) can reduce tumorigenicity, altering MAPK signaling by DUSP-MKP inhibitors could be a novel strategy in anti-cancer therapy. Moreover, Cdc25A is, a DUSP and a key regulator of the cell cycle, promotes cell cycle progression by dephosphorylating and activating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK). Cdc25A-CDK pathway is a novel mechanism in carcinogenesis. Besides the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase inhibitors or mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibition in combination with the dual phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/mTOR or AKT kinase inhibitors are more effective in\nthe downregulation of the p38 pathway. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase/MAP kinase phosphatase regulation: roles in cell growth, death, and cancer. Mitogen-activated protein kinase dual-specificity phosphatase-1 (also called MKP-1, DUSP1, ERP, CL100, HVH1, PTPN10, and 3CH134) is a member of the threonine-tyrosine dual-specificity phosphatases, one of more than 100 protein tyrosine phosphatases. It was first identified approximately 20 years ago, and since that time extensive investigations into both mkp-1 mRNA and protein regulation and function in different cells, tissues, and organs have been conducted. However, no general review on the topic of MKP-1 exists. As the subject matter pertaining to MKP-1 encompasses many branches of the biomedical field, we focus on the role of this protein in cancer development and progression, highlighting the potential role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. Section II of this article elucidates the MAPK family cross-talk. Section III reviews the structure of the mkp-1 encoding\nfamily. Section II of this article elucidates the MAPK family cross-talk. Section III reviews the structure of the mkp-1 encoding gene, and the known mechanisms regulating the expression and activity of the protein. Section IV is an overview of the MAPK-specific dual-specificity phosphatases and their role in cancer. In sections V and VI, mkp-1 mRNA and protein are examined in relation to cancer biology, therapeutics, and clinical studies, including a discussion of the potential role of the MAPK family. We conclude by proposing an integrated scheme for MKP-1 and MAPK in cancer. Ssu72 Dual-Specific Protein Phosphatase: From Gene to Diseases More than 70% of eukaryotic proteins are regulated by phosphorylation. However, the mechanism of dephosphorylation that counteracts phosphorylation is less studied. Phosphatases are classified into 104 distinct groups based on substrate-specific features and the sequence homologies in their catalytic domains. Among them, dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) that dephosphorylate both phosphoserine/threonine and\nfrom initiation to elongation. In addition, Ssu72 can function as a transcription elongation factor. Together with the Ser2P phosphatase Fcp1, Ssu72 can restore the hypophosphorylated form of RNAPII. Recent studies have shown that Ess1, a proline isomerase, can interact with TFIIB and Ssu72 during transcription elongation and induce Ser5P\u2013Pro6 CTD structural conformation during transcription termination. It has been shown that this complicated interplay between Ssu72 and diverse kinases/phosphatases can affect the elongation\u2013termination transition and facilitate the pause and release of RNAPII in response to a limited number of snoRNAs and transcripts of specific mRNAs, indicating that Ssu72 plays an essential role in the transcription termination process by facilitating RNAPII pause and release. Because the role of Ssu72 in transcription termination is intimately involved in RNA 3\u2032-end processing, this is elucidated in the section discussing 3\u2032-end cleavage and polyadenylation by Ssu72 phosphatase. In later stages of transcription, Ssu72 can act as\nthree subunits: a poly (A) polymerase, a nuclease, and a phosphatase subunit. In yeast, the poly (A) polymerase subunit comprises five proteins, four of which have human homologues: Yhh1 (CPF160), Yth1 (CPF30), Pfs2 (WDR33), Fip1 (hFip1), and poly (A) polymerase. The nuclease subunit comprises three proteins: Ysh1 (CPF73), Ydh1 (CPF100), and Mpe1 (RBBP6). The phosphatase subunit comprises six proteins: Pta1 (Symplekin), Ssu72, Swd2 (WDR82), Glc7 (PP1a/b), Pti1, and Ref2. Ssu72 is essential for 3\u2032-end cleavage, poly (A) addition, and RNAPII termination. Ssu72, as one of the components of CPF, can strongly interact with Pta1 and Pti1. It can also weakly interact with Ydh1p/Cft2p through the Rpb2 subunit of RNAPII. Thus, Ssu72 is also connected to CPF, TFIIB, and RNAPII. Ssu72 cannot affect 3\u2019-end processing without interacting with Pta1. Pta1 is a subunit of the CPF complex that functions in pre-mRNA cleavage, poly (A) addition, and transcription termination. Pta1 and Ssu72\nterminator, the inactivation of Ssu72 increases the synthesis of SRTs. These findings indicate that Ssu72 can regulate the formation of gene loops and the transcriptional directionality of otherwise-bidirectional promoters. 3. Ssu72 in Chromosome Segregation, Telomere Regulation, and DNA Endoreplication Most of the early studies on the Ssu72 phosphatase focused on its transcriptional functions in yeast, but recent reports have proposed that it is required as a chromosome-associated regulator, involved in chromosome segregation, telomere regulation, and hepatic chromosome polyploidization. During mitosis, proper chromosome alignment and separation between sister chromatids are critical. This process occurs in a stepwise manner due to the involvement of the cohesin subunits [structural maintenance of chromosomes 1 (SMC1), SMC3, RAD21, and stromal antigen (SA)], which form a ring structure that topologically encircles DNA, and regulatory proteins such as Aurora B, cdk1, and plk1. In terms of the balance between the cohesion and segregation of sister chromatids, Ssu72\nthe 3\u2032-end processing of nascent mRNA and gene looping. 2.1. Ssu72 Acts as an RNA Polymerase II CTD Phosphatase in the Transcription Cycle The CTD of RNA polymerase B1 (Rpb1), the largest subunit of RNAPII, is crucial for the regulation of distinct steps in transcription, which is composed of three main stages (initiation, elongation, and termination) in eukaryotes. The CTD is composed of heptad repeats with the consensus motif Tyr1\u2013Ser2\u2013Pro3\u2013Thr4\u2013Ser5\u2013Pro6\u2013Ser7. The length of its repeat sequence differs between species, ranging from 26 repeats in budding yeast to 52 repeats in mammals. The sequence of the CTD undergoes dynamic structural changes through multiple post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, cis\u2013trans Pro isomerization, and O-GlcNAcylation. Flexible interactions between the CTD and diverse factors at appropriate stages of the transcription process are critical for the regulation of multiple steps of the transcription cycle. They are also essential for the successful transition of the transcription cycle\nregulation of multiple steps of the transcription cycle. They are also essential for the successful transition of the transcription cycle and transcriptional processing, such as the 3\u2032-end processing of nascent mRNA. Ssu72 participates in the dephosphorylation of the CTD by targeting Ser5P and Ser7P of the RNAPII CTD rather than Ser2P. Ssu72 is involved in the assembly of the PIC at the transcription start site. It has been suggested that the Ssu72 phosphatase is associated with the CTD and other transcription factors. For example, Ssu72 depletion can disrupt transcriptional transitions in vitro and increase Ser5 phosphorylation towards the 3\u2032-end of a gene. During transcription initiation, Ssu72 can genetically and functionally interact with subunits of RNAPII (Figure 1A). The interplay between Ssu72 and RNAPII subunits including Rpb2 and Rpb4/7, which act as core RNAPII core machinery, can lead to PIC formation during transcription initiation. It has been shown that Ssu72 can\nby alanine cannot thrive. The expression of Pho1, Pho84, and Tgp1 is decreased by upstream long noncoding (lnc) RNA. These genes readily respond to changes in lncRNA 3\u2032 processing/termination. Pin1\u0394 excessively inhibits the expression of the PHO gene and eliminates the inhibitory effect of CTD-S7A. Many coding RNAs are down- or upregulated in Pin1\u0394 cells, contributing to the inactivation of cis-proline-dependent Ssu72 CTD phosphatase activity. Thus, Pin1 can positively influence 3\u2032 processing/termination that is activated via Ssu72. 2.2.2. Gene Looping The RNAPII transcription cycle consists of distinct stages: the assembly of the PIC, initiation, elongation, termination, and reinitiation. When a gene is completely transcribed, RNAPII and newly synthesized RNA are released from the DNA template. The released RNAPII can revert to its basic hypophosphorylated state and participate in a new transcription process.

The essential CDC14 gene of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, encodes a 62-kDa protein containing a sequence that conforms to the active site motif found in all enzymes of the protein tyrosine phosphatase superfamily. Genetic studies suggest that Cdc14p may be involved in the initiation of DNA replication, but its precise cell cycle function is unknown. Recombinant Cdc14p was produced in bacteria, characterized, and shown to be a dual specificity protein phosphatase. Polyanions such as polyglutamate and double-stranded and single-stranded DNA bind to Cdc14p and affect its activity. Native molecular weights of 131,000 and 169,000 determined by two independent methods indicate that recombinant Cdc14p self-associates in vitro to form active oligomers.

Aberrant MAPK signaling plays a pivotal role in carcinogenesis, which leads to development and progression of human cancer. Dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), a member of the MAPK phosphatase family, interacts with specifically targeted extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 via negative feedback regulation in the MAPK pathway of mammalian cells. This phosphatase functions in a dual manner, pro-oncogenic or tumor-suppressive, depending on the type of cancer. To date, the tumor-suppressive role of DUSP6 has been demonstrated in pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal squamous cell and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and ovarian cancer. Its pro-oncogenic role has been observed in human glioblastoma, thyroid carcinoma, breast cancer, and acute myeloid carcinoma. Both roles of DUSP6 have been documented in malignant melanoma depending on the histological subtype of the cancer.

The WRAP53 gene encodes both an antisense transcript (WRAP53\u03b1) that stabilizes the tumor suppressor p53 and a protein (WRAP53\u03b2) involved in maintenance of Cajal bodies, telomere elongation and DNA repair. WRAP53\u03b2 is one of many proteins containing WD40 domains, known to mediate a variety of cellular processes. These proteins lack enzymatic activity, acting instead as platforms for the assembly of large complexes of proteins and RNAs thus facilitating their interactions. WRAP53\u03b2 mediates site-specific interactions between Cajal body factors and DNA repair proteins. Moreover, dysfunction of this protein has been linked to premature aging, cancer and neurodegeneration. Here we summarize the current state of knowledge concerning the multifaceted roles of WRAP53\u03b2 in intracellular trafficking, formation of the Cajal body, DNA repair and maintenance of genomic integrity and discuss potential crosstalk between these\ndomain/WD-40 repeat-containing proteins in feed-forward transcriptional repression by silencing mediator for retinoic and thyroid receptor/nuclear receptor corepressor complexes. Lis-homology (LisH) motifs are involved in protein dimerization, and the discovery of the conserved N-terminal LisH domain in transducin beta-like protein 1 and its receptor (TBL1 and TBLR1) led us to examine the role of this domain in transcriptional repression. Here we show that multiple beta-transducin (WD-40) repeat-containing proteins interact to form oligomers in solution and that oligomerization depends on the presence of the LisH domain in each protein. Repression of transcription, as assayed using Gal4 fusion proteins, also depended on the presence of the LisH domain, suggesting that oligomerization is a prerequisite for efficient transcriptional repression. Furthermore, we show that the LisH domain is responsible for the binding to the hypoacetylated histone H4 tail and for stable chromatin targeting by the nuclear receptor corepressor complex. Mutations in conserved residues in the\nlevels. Collectively, our findings bolster the link between SMN, coilin and the coilin derivative in the biogenesis of telomerase. WRAP53 is essential for Cajal body formation and for targeting the survival of motor neuron complex to Cajal bodies. The WRAP53 gene gives rise to a p53 antisense transcript that regulates p53. This gene also encodes a protein that directs small Cajal body-specific RNAs to Cajal bodies. Cajal bodies are nuclear organelles involved in diverse functions such as processing ribonucleoproteins important for splicing. Here we identify the WRAP53 protein as an essential factor for Cajal body maintenance and for directing the survival of motor neuron (SMN) complex to Cajal bodies. By RNA interference and immunofluorescence we show that Cajal bodies collapse without WRAP53 and that new Cajal bodies cannot be formed. By immunoprecipitation we find that WRAP53 associates with the Cajal body marker coilin, the splicing regulatory protein SMN, and the\nstructural configuration of mutants R505L, R465H, R465P, R505G, R505C, R465C, R505S and R505L structures. Protein-protein interaction network of FBXW7 populated with promising hub proteins NOTCH1, c-Myc, CCNE1, STYX, KLG5, SREB1, NFKB2, SKP1 and CUL1; thus, alteration in the FBXW7 leads to aberration in their signalling pathways as well as their substrate binding ability makes this protein as attractive target for personalized therapeutic intervention. The scaffold protein WRAP53\u03b2 orchestrates the ubiquitin response critical for DNA double-strand break repair. The WD40 domain-containing protein WRAP53\u03b2 (WD40 encoding RNA antisense to p53; also referred to as WDR79/TCAB1) controls trafficking of splicing factors and the telomerase enzyme to Cajal bodies, and its functional loss has been linked to carcinogenesis, premature aging, and neurodegeneration. Here, we identify WRAP53\u03b2 as an essential regulator of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. WRAP53\u03b2 rapidly localizes to DSBs in an ATM-, H2AX-, and MDC1-dependent manner. We show that WRAP53\u03b2 targets the\nhistone H4 tail and for stable chromatin targeting by the nuclear receptor corepressor complex. Mutations in conserved residues in the LisH motif of TBL1 and TBLR1 block histone binding, oligomerization, and transcriptional repression, supporting the functional importance of the LisH motif in transcriptional repression. Our results indicate that another WD-40 protein, TBL3, also preferentially binds to the N-terminal domain of TBL1 and TBLR1, and forms oligomers with other WD-40 proteins. Finally, we observed that the WD-40 proteins RbAp46 and RbAp48 of the sin3A corepressor complex failed to dimerize. We also found the specific interaction UbcH/E2 with TBL1, but not RbAp46/48. Altogether, our results thus indicate that the presence of multiple LisH/WD-40 repeat containing proteins is exclusive to nuclear receptor corepressor/ silencing mediator for retinoic and thyroid receptor complexes compared with other class 1 histone deacetylase-containing corepessor complexes. On the road with WRAP53\u03b2: guardian of Cajal bodies and genome integrity. The\nBy immunoprecipitation we find that WRAP53 associates with the Cajal body marker coilin, the splicing regulatory protein SMN, and the nuclear import receptor importin\u03b2, and that WRAP53 is essential for complex formation between SMN-coilin and SMN-importin\u03b2. Furthermore, depletion of WRAP53 leads to accumulation of SMN in the cytoplasm and prevents the SMN complex from reaching Cajal bodies. Thus, WRAP53 mediates the interaction between SMN and associated proteins, which is important for nuclear targeting of SMN and the subsequent localization of the SMN complex to Cajal bodies. Moreover, we detect reduced WRAP53-SMN binding in patients with spinal muscular atrophy, which is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality worldwide, caused by mutations in SMN1. This suggests that loss of WRAP53-mediated SMN trafficking contributes to spinal muscular atrophy. Function of multiple Lis-Homology domain/WD-40 repeat-containing proteins in feed-forward transcriptional repression by silencing mediator for retinoic and thyroid receptor/nuclear receptor corepressor complexes. Lis-homology (LisH)\nprevents TERC from associating with Cajal bodies, disrupts telomerase-telomere association, and abrogates telomere synthesis by telomerase. Thus, TCAB1 controls telomerase trafficking and is required for telomere synthesis in human cancer cells. The structure of Ski8p, a protein regulating mRNA degradation: Implications for WD protein structure. Ski8p is a 44-kD protein that primarily functions in the regulation of exosome-mediated, 3'--> 5' degradation of damaged mRNA. It does so by forming a complex with two partner proteins, Ski2p and Ski3p, which complete a complex that is capable of recruiting and activating the exosome/Ski7p complex that functions in RNA degradation. Ski8p also functions in meiotic recombination in complex with Spo11 in yeast. It is one of the many hundreds of primarily eukaryotic proteins containing tandem copies of WD repeats (also known as WD40 or beta-transducin repeats), which are short ~40 amino acid motifs, often terminating in a Trp-Asp dipeptide. Genomic analyses have demonstrated\nintracellular trafficking, formation of the Cajal body, DNA repair and maintenance of genomic integrity and discuss potential crosstalk between these processes. A human telomerase holoenzyme protein required for Cajal body localization and telomere synthesis. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that synthesizes telomere repeats in tissue progenitor cells and cancer cells. Active human telomerase consists of at least three principal subunits, including the telomerase reverse transcriptase, the telomerase RNA (TERC), and dyskerin. Here, we identify a holoenzyme subunit, TCAB1 (telomerase Cajal body protein 1), that is notably enriched in Cajal bodies, nuclear sites of RNP processing that are important for telomerase function. TCAB1 associates with active telomerase enzyme, established telomerase components, and small Cajal body RNAs that are involved in modifying splicing RNAs. Depletion of TCAB1 by using RNA interference prevents TERC from associating with Cajal bodies, disrupts telomerase-telomere association, and abrogates telomere synthesis by telomerase. Thus, TCAB1 controls telomerase\nthe maximum deregulated ubiquitin-proteasome system proteins in uterine carcinosarcoma, endometrial clear cell carcinoma and cervical carcinoma with the greatest prevalence of alterations. FBXW7 variants with known clinical significance, as well as non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in the F-Box and WD40 domains, were evaluated using functionality prediction web resources. Upon analysing the seventy-three deleterious nsSNP's impact on protein stability and function, we identified that forty-one nsSNPs of WD40 domain and three of F-Box domain imply decreased stability of the FBXW7 structure. Next to TP53 and PTEN, FBXW7 was reported with the highest percentage of arginine substitution among mutations related to cancer. The current research concentrated on two arginine residue locations (Arg465, Arg505) within the WD40-repeat domain, which is vital for substrate binding. Computational analysis revealed significant deviation in stability and structural configuration of mutants R505L, R465H, R465P, R505G, R505C, R465C, R505S and R505L structures. Protein-protein interaction network of FBXW7 populated\nCoilin association with Box C/D scaRNA suggests a direct role for the Cajal body marker protein in scaRNP biogenesis. Spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) are enriched in the Cajal body (CB). Guide RNAs, known as small Cajal body-specific RNAs (scaRNAs), direct modification of the small nuclear RNA (snRNA) component of the snRNP. The protein WRAP53 binds a sequence motif (the CAB box) found in many scaRNAs and the RNA component of telomerase (hTR) and targets these RNAs to the CB. We have previously reported that coilin, the CB marker protein, associates with certain non-coding RNAs. For a more comprehensive examination of the RNAs associated with coilin, we have sequenced the RNA isolated from coilin immunocomplexes. A striking preferential association of coilin with the box C/D scaRNAs 2 and 9, which lack a CAB box, was observed. This association varied by treatment condition and WRAP53 knockdown. In contrast, reduction of WRAP53\nhere that coilin, SMN and coilp1, a newly identified protein encoded by a pseudogene in human, associate with telomerase RNA and a subset of scaRNAs. We also have identified a processing element within box C/D scaRNA. Our findings thus further strengthen the connection between the CB proteins coilin and SMN in the biogenesis of telomeras e and box C/D scaRNPs, and reveal a new player, coilp1, that likely participates in this process. SMN and coilin negatively regulate dyskerin association with telomerase RNA. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein comprising telomerase RNA and associated proteins. The formation of the telomerase holoenzyme takes place in the Cajal body (CB), a subnuclear domain that participates in the formation of ribonucleoproteins. CBs also contribute to the delivery of telomerase to telomeres. The protein WRAP53 is enriched within the CB and is instrumental for the targeting of telomerase RNA to CBs. Two other CB proteins, SMN and\nby providing a scaffold for DNA repair factors. Identification of processing elements and interactors implicate SMN, coilin and the pseudogene-encoded coilp1 in telomerase and box C/D scaRNP biogenesis. Many cellular functions, such as translation, require ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). The biogenesis of RNPs is a multi-step process that, depending on the RNP, can take place in many cellular compartments. Here we examine 2 different RNPs: telomerase and small Cajal body-specific RNPs (scaRNPs). Both of these RNPs are enriched in the Cajal body (CB), which is a subnuclear domain that also has high concentrations of another RNP, small nuclear RNPs (snRNPs). SnRNPs are essential components of the spliceosome, and scaRNPs modify the snRNA component of the snRNP. The CB contains many proteins, including WRAP53, SMN and coilin, the CB marker protein. We show here that coilin, SMN and coilp1, a newly identified protein encoded by a pseudogene in human, associate with telomerase RNA\nlack a CAB box, was observed. This association varied by treatment condition and WRAP53 knockdown. In contrast, reduction of WRAP53 did not alter the level of coilin association with hTR. Additional studies showed that coilin degrades/processes scaRNA 2 and 9, associates with active telomerase and can influence telomerase activity. These findings suggest that coilin plays a novel role in the biogenesis of box C/D scaRNPs and telomerase. Comprehensive Study of Human FBXW7 Deleterious nsSNP's Functional Inference and Susceptibility to Gynaecological Cancer. Cancer is one of the world's major causes of mortality, and it plays a most important role in the world's declining life expectancy. F-box and WD-40 domain protein 7 (FBXW7), a typical participant of the F-box family of proteins, has been considered as an anti-tumor protein and one of the maximum deregulated ubiquitin-proteasome system proteins in uterine carcinosarcoma, endometrial clear cell carcinoma and cervical carcinoma with the greatest prevalence\nor beta-transducin repeats), which are short ~40 amino acid motifs, often terminating in a Trp-Asp dipeptide. Genomic analyses have demonstrated that WD repeats are found in 1%-2% of proteins in a typical eukaryote, but are extremely rare in prokaryotes. Almost all structurally characterized WD-repeat proteins are composed of seven such repeats and fold into seven-bladed beta propellers. Ski8p was thought to contain five WD repeats on the basis of primary sequence analysis implying a five-bladed propeller. The 1.9 A crystal structure unexpectedly exhibits a seven-bladed propeller fold with seven structurally authentic WD repeats. Structure-based sequence alignments show additional sequence diversity in the two undetected repeats. This demonstrates that many WD repeats have not yet been identified in sequences and also raises the possibility that the seven-bladed propeller may be the predominant fold for this family of proteins.\nwithin the CB and is instrumental for the targeting of telomerase RNA to CBs. Two other CB proteins, SMN and coilin, are also suspected of taking part in some aspect of telomerase biogenesis. Here we demonstrate newly discovered associations between SMN and coilin with telomerase components, and further show that reduction of SMN or coilin is correlated with increased association of telomerase RNA with one these components, dyskerin. These findings argue that SMN and coilin may negatively regulate the formation of telomerase. Furthermore, clinically defined SMN mutants found in individuals with spinal muscular atrophy are altered in their association with telomerase complex proteins. Additionally, we observe that a coilin derivative also associates with dyskerin, and the amount of this protein in the complex is regulated by SMN, WRAP53 and coilin levels. Collectively, our findings bolster the link between SMN, coilin and the coilin derivative in the biogenesis of telomerase. WRAP53\n(DSB) repair. WRAP53\u03b2 rapidly localizes to DSBs in an ATM-, H2AX-, and MDC1-dependent manner. We show that WRAP53\u03b2 targets the E3 ligase RNF8 to DNA lesions by facilitating the interaction between RNF8 and its upstream partner, MDC1, in response to DNA damage. Simultaneous binding of MDC1 and RNF8 to the highly conserved WD40 scaffold domain of WRAP53\u03b2 facilitates their interaction and accumulation of RNF8 at DSBs. In this manner, WRAP53\u03b2 controls proper ubiquitylation at DNA damage sites and the downstream assembly of 53BP1, BRCA1, and RAD51. Furthermore, we reveal that knockdown of WRAP53\u03b2 impairs DSB repair by both homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), causes accumulation of spontaneous DNA breaks, and delays recovery from radiation-induced cell cycle arrest. Our findings establish WRAP53\u03b2 as a novel regulator of DSB repair by providing a scaffold for DNA repair factors.

        "desc": "Calmodulin potentiates G beta gamma activation of phospholipase C-beta3. Phospholipase C-beta (PLC-beta) isozymes (EC 3.1.4.11) hydrolyze the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to generate intracellular second messenger signaling molecules inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) in response to receptor activation and other cellular stimuli. PLCbeta1 and PLCbeta3 isozymes were previously demonstrated to bind the calcium-sensitive molecule calmodulin [McCullar JS, Larsen SA, Millimaki RA, Filtz TM. Calmodulin is a phospholipase C-{beta} interacting protein. J Biol Chem 2003;278(36):33708-13]. We have now shown through fluorescence anisotropy that calmodulin/PLCbeta3 affinities increase with increasing calcium in a physiologically relevant concentration range. The bimolecular affinity constants for calmodulin interaction with PLCbeta1 or PLCbeta3 were estimated as 260 and 200 nM, respectively, from fluorescence anisotropy data. There was no effect of calmodulin on basal or G alpha q-stimulated catalytic activity for either isozyme. However, the interaction between calmodulin and PLCbeta3 leads to potentiation of activation by the G-protein beta gamma\ntreatment of disease. Regulation of phospholipase C-beta 3 activity by Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 2. Among the phospholipase C that catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, four mammalian phospholipase C-beta (PLC-beta) isotypes (isotypes 1-4) are activated through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Although the regulation of the PLC-betas by GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins has been extensively studied, little is known about the molecular determinants that regulate their activity. The PLC-beta isozymes carry a putative PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) binding motif (X(S/T)X(V/L)COOH) at their carboxyl terminus, which is implicated in specific interactions with anchor proteins. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor 2 (NHERF2) as a protein that interacted with a C-terminal heptapeptide of PLC-beta3. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that NHERF2 interacts specifically with PLC-beta3, but not with other PLC-beta isotypes. Furthermore, PLC-beta3 interacted with NHERF2 rather than with other PDZ-containing proteins. This interaction required the COOH-terminal NTQL sequence of\nbinding assays indicated that LY294002 did not affect G protein-coupled receptors directly, suggesting a physiological role for PIP(3) in directly potentiating PLC-beta activity. When coexpressed with p110CAAX, fluorescence-tagged PLC-beta3 was increasingly localized to the plasma membrane. Additional observations suggest that the PH domain of PLC-beta is not important for p110CAAX-induced membrane association. Regulation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C. Eleven distinct isoforms of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC), which are grouped into four subfamilies (beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon), have been identified in mammals. These isozymes catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2] to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol in response to the activation of more than 100 different cell surface receptors. All PLC isoforms contain X and Y domains, which form the catalytic core, as well as various combinations of regulatory domains that are common to many other signaling proteins. These regulatory domains serve to target PLC isozymes to the vicinity of their\nfor CaM in modulation of PLC beta activity. There was no effect of CaM kinase II inhibitors, KN-93 and KN-62, on M1-muscarinic receptor stimulation of inositol phosphate hydrolysis, consistent with a direct interaction between PLC beta isoforms and CaM. PI(3,4,5)P3 potentiates phospholipase C-beta activity. Phospholipase C-beta (PLC-beta) isozymes are key effectors in G protein-coupled signaling pathways. Previously, we showed that PLC-beta1 and PLC-beta3 bound immobilized PIP(3). In this study, PIP(3) was found to potentiate Ca(2+)-stimulated PLC-beta activities using an in vitro reconstitution assay. LY294002, a specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor, significantly inhibited 10 min of agonist-stimulated total IP accumulation. Both LY294002 and wortmannin inhibited 90 sec of agonist-stimulated IP(3) accumulation in intact cells. Moreover, transfected p110CAAX, a constitutively activated PI 3-kinase catalytic subunit, increased 90 sec of oxytocin-stimulated IP(3) accumulation. Receptor-ligand binding assays indicated that LY294002 did not affect G protein-coupled receptors directly, suggesting a physiological role for PIP(3) in directly\nDiacylglycerol kinase converts diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid, a newly emerging intracellular mediator of hormone action that targets a number of signaling proteins. Activation of the Gq linked PLC-beta signaling pathway can also generate additional signaling lipids, including phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate, which regulate the activity and/or localization of a number of proteins. Novel feedback mechanisms, directed at the level of Gq and PLC-beta, have been identified. PLC-beta and regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) function as GTPase-activating proteins on Gq to control the amplitude and duration of stimulation. Protein kinases phosphorylate and regulate the activation of specific PLC-beta isoforms. Phosphatidic acid regulates PLC-beta1 activity and stimulation of PLC-beta1 activity by G proteins. These feedback mechanisms coordinate receptor signaling and cell activation. Feedback mechanisms constitute possible targets for pharmacological intervention in the treatment of disease. Regulation of phospholipase C-beta 3 activity by Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 2. Among the phospholipase C that\nPLC-beta1 and PLC-beta 3 are activated by bradykinin (BK) or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), respectively. BK-triggered phosphoinositides hydrolysis and subsequent Ca(2+) mobilization were abolished specifically by PLC-beta1 silencing, whereas LPA-triggered events were by PLC-beta 3 silencing. Secondly, we showed the evidence that PDZ scaffold proteins is a key mediator for the selective coupling between PLC-beta subtype and GPCR. We found PAR-3 mediates physical interaction between PLC-beta1 and BK receptor, while NHERF2 does between PLC-beta 3 and LPA(2) receptor. Consistently, the silencing of PAR-3 or NHERF2 blunted PLC signaling induced by BK or LPA respectively. Taken together, these data suggest that each subtype of PLC-beta is selectively coupled to GPCR via PDZ scaffold proteins in given cell types and plays differential role in the signaling of various GPCRs. Differential association of the pleckstrin homology domains of phospholipases C-beta 1, C-beta 2, and C-delta 1 with lipid bilayers and the beta gamma subunits\nmicrotubule formation was assessed by overexpression and silencing PLC-gamma1 in COS-7 cells, which resulted in altered microtubule dynamics in vivo. Cells overexpressing PLC-gamma1 showed higher microtubule densities than controls, whereas PLC-gamma1 silencing with small interfering RNAs led to decreased microtubule network densities as compared with control cells. Taken together, our results suggest that PLC-gamma1 and beta-tubulin transmodulate each other, i.e. that PLC-gamma1 modulates microtubule assembly by beta-tubulin, and beta-tubulin promotes PLC-gamma1 activity. Calmodulin is a phospholipase C-beta interacting protein. Phospholipase C-beta 3 (PLC beta 3) is an important effector enzyme in G protein-coupled signaling pathways. Activation of PLC beta 3 by G alpha and G beta gamma subunits has been fairly well characterized, but little is known about other protein interactions that may also regulate PLC beta 3 function. A yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse brain cDNA library with the amino terminus of PLC beta 3 has yielded potential\ncontrast, docking of the PH domain of PLC-beta2 with G-beta gamma is comparable to that of the full-length protein and may play a key role in G-beta gamma recognition. Novel mechanisms for feedback regulation of phospholipase C-beta activity. The receptor-regulated phospholipase C-beta (PLC-beta) signaling pathway is an important component in a network of signaling cascades that regulate cell function. PLC-beta signaling has been implicated in the regulation of cardiovascular function and neuronal plasticity. The Gq family of G proteins mediate receptor stimulation of PLC-beta activity at the plasma membrane. Mitogens stimulate the activity of a nuclear pool of PLC-beta. Stimulation of PLC-beta activity results in the rapid hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, with production of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, intracellular mediators that increase intracellular Ca2+ levels and activate protein kinase C activity, respectively. Diacylglycerol kinase converts diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid, a newly emerging intracellular mediator of hormone action that targets a number of\nisotypes. Furthermore, PLC-beta3 interacted with NHERF2 rather than with other PDZ-containing proteins. This interaction required the COOH-terminal NTQL sequence of PLC-beta3 and the second PDZ domain of NHERF2. Interestingly, NHERF2 potentiated the PLC-beta activation by carbachol in COS7 and HeLa cells, while mutant NHERF2, lacking the second PDZ domain, had no such effect. Taken together, the data suggest that NHERF2 may act as a modulator underlying the process of PLC-beta3-mediated signaling. The Pleckstrin homology domains of phospholipases C-beta and -delta confer activation through a common site. Mammalian inositol-specific phospholipase C-beta2 (PLC beta 2) and PLC delta 1 differ in their cellular activators. PLC beta 2 can be activated by G beta gamma subunits, whereas PLC delta 1 can be activated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). For both proteins, the N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain appears to mediate activation. Here, we have constructed a chimera in which we placed the N-terminal\nyeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse brain cDNA library with the amino terminus of PLC beta 3 has yielded potential PLC beta 3 interacting proteins including calmodulin (CaM). Physical interaction between CaM and PLC beta 3 is supported by a positive secondary screen in yeast and the identification of a CaM binding site in the amino terminus of PLC beta 3. Co-precipitation of in vitro translated and transcribed amino- and carboxyl-terminal PLC beta 3 revealed CaM binding at a putative amino-terminal binding site. Direct physical interaction of PLC beta 3 and PLC beta 1 isoforms with CaM is supported by pull-down of both isoenzymes with CaM-Sepharose beads from 1321N1 cell lysates. CaM inhibitors reduced M1-muscarinic receptor stimulation of inositol phospholipid hydrolysis in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells consistent with a physiologic role for CaM in modulation of PLC beta activity. There was no effect of CaM kinase II inhibitors, KN-93 and KN-62,\nthese PH domains bind to membrane surfaces composed of zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine with moderate affinity. Inclusion of the anionic lipid phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] and inclusion of G-beta gamma subunits had little affect on their membrane affinity. In contrast, binding of PLC-delta 1 or its PH domain was highly dependent on PI(4,5)P2. We also determined whether these domains laterally associate with G-beta gamma subunits bound to membrane surfaces using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Affinities for G-beta gamma were in the following order: PH-beta 2 >/= PH-beta 1 > PH-delta 1; the affinities of the native enzyme were as follows: PLC-beta 2 >> PLC-delta 1 > PLC-beta 1. Thus, the PH domain of PLC-beta 1 interacts with G-beta gamma in isolation, but not in the context of the native enzyme. By contrast, docking of the PH domain of PLC-beta2 with G-beta gamma is comparable to that of the full-length protein and\npleckstrin homology domains of phospholipases C-beta 1, C-beta 2, and C-delta 1 with lipid bilayers and the beta gamma subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains are recognized in more than 100 different proteins, including mammalian phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) isozymes (isotypes beta, gamma, and delta). These structural motifs are thought to function as tethering devices linking their host proteins to membranes containing phosphoinositides or beta gamma subunits of heterotrimeric GTP binding (G) proteins. Although the PH domains of PLC-delta and PLC-gamma have been studied, the comparable domains of the beta isotypes have not. Here, we have measured the affinities of the isolated PH domains of PLC-beta 1 and -beta 2 (PH-beta 1 and PH-beta 2, respectively) for lipid bilayers and G-beta gamma subunits. Like the intact enzymes, these PH domains bind to membrane surfaces composed of zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine with moderate affinity. Inclusion of the anionic lipid phosphatidylserine\ngenerated or eliminated in specific regions of the cell in response to changes in receptor status, the activation and deactivation of each PLC isoform are likely highly regulated processes. Subtype-specific role of phospholipase C-beta in bradykinin and LPA signaling through differential binding of different PDZ scaffold proteins. Among phospholipase C (PLC) isozymes (beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta and eta), PLC-beta plays a key role in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated signaling. PLC-beta subtypes are often overlapped in their distribution, but have unique knock-out phenotypes in organism, suggesting that each subtype may have the different role even within the same type of cells. In this study, we examined the possibility of the differential coupling of each PLC-beta subtype to GPCRs, and explored the molecular mechanism underlying the specificity. Firstly, we found that PLC-beta1 and PLC-beta 3 are activated by bradykinin (BK) or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), respectively. BK-triggered phosphoinositides hydrolysis and subsequent Ca(2+)\nare common to many other signaling proteins. These regulatory domains serve to target PLC isozymes to the vicinity of their substrate or activators through protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions. These domains (with their binding partners in parentheses or brackets) include the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain [PtdIns(3)P, beta gamma subunits of G proteins] and the COOH-terminal region including the C2 domain (GTP-bound alpha subunit of Gq) of PLC-beta; the PH domain [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] and Src homology 2 domain [tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] of PLC-gamma; the PH domain [PtdIns(4,5)P2] and C2 domain (Ca2+) of PLC-delta; and the Ras binding domain (GTP-bound Ras) of PLC-epsilon. The presence of distinct regulatory domains in PLC isoforms renders them susceptible to different modes of activation. Given that the partners that interact with these regulatory domains of PLC isozymes are generated or eliminated in specific regions of the cell in response to changes in receptor status, the activation and deactivation\npleckstrin homology (PH) domain appears to mediate activation. Here, we have constructed a chimera in which we placed the N-terminal PH domain of PLC delta 1 into remaining C-terminal regions of PLC beta 2. The PH delta PLC beta chimera showed PI(4,5)P2-dependent membrane binding similar to PLC delta 1 and a G beta gamma interaction energy close to that of PLC delta 1. Like PLC delta 1, the chimera was activated by PI(4,5)P2 through the PH domain but not by G beta gamma. Because these and previous results indicate a common site of contact between the PH and catalytic domains in these two enzymes, we computationally docked the known structures of the PH and catalytic domains of PLC delta 1. A synthetic peptide whose sequence matches a potential interaction site between the two domains inhibited the basal activity of PLC beta 2, PLC delta 1, and a G beta gamma-activable\nbetween the two domains inhibited the basal activity of PLC beta 2, PLC delta 1, and a G beta gamma-activable PH beta 2-PLC delta 1 chimera. Also, the peptide was able to inhibit PI(4,5)P2 and G beta gamma activation of the PH-PLC delta 1 PH-PLC beta 2 enzymes in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that this is the region responsible for PH domain-mediated activation of the catalytic core.\nfor either isozyme. However, the interaction between calmodulin and PLCbeta3 leads to potentiation of activation by the G-protein beta gamma dimer in an in vitro assay. 1321N1 cells treated with calmodulin inhibitors concurrent with and post-stimulation of muscarinic receptors significantly reduced [3H]PIP hydrolysis. Together these data are suggestive of cooperative role for calmodulin in the G-protein beta gamma dimer-stimulated activity of PLCbeta3. Pleckstrin homology domains of phospholipase C-gamma1 directly interact with beta-tubulin for activation of phospholipase C-gamma1 and reciprocal modulation of beta-tubulin function in microtubule assembly. Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLC-gamma1) has two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, an N-terminal domain and a split PH domain. Here we show that pull down of NIH3T3 cell extracts with PLC-gamma1 PH domain-glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry, identified beta-tubulin as a binding protein of both PLC-gamma1 PH domains. Tubulin is a main component of microtubules and mitotic\nidentified beta-tubulin as a binding protein of both PLC-gamma1 PH domains. Tubulin is a main component of microtubules and mitotic spindle fibers, which are composed of alpha- and beta-tubulin heterodimers in all eukaryotic cells. PLC-gamma1 and beta-tubulin colocalized in the perinuclear region in COS-7 cells and cotranslocated to the plasma membrane upon agonist stimulation. Membrane-targeted translocation of depolymerized tubulin by agonist stimulation was also supported by immunoprecipitation analyses. The phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) hydrolyzing activity of PLC-gamma1 was substantially increased in the presence of purified tubulin in vitro, whereas the activity was not promoted by bovine serum albumin, suggesting that beta-tubulin activates PLC-gamma1. Furthermore, indirect immunofluorescent microscopy showed that PLC-gamma1 was highly concentrated in mitotic spindle fibers, suggesting that PLC-gamma1 is involved in spindle fiber formation. The effect of PLC-gamma1 in microtubule formation was assessed by overexpression and silencing PLC-gamma1 in COS-7 cells, which resulted in altered microtubule dynamics in vivo.",

N 6-methyladenosine (m6A), a major modification of messenger RNAs (mRNAs), plays critical roles in RNA metabolism and function. In addition to the internal m6A, N 6, 2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) is present at the transcription start nucleotide of capped mRNAs in vertebrates. However, its biogenesis and functional role remain elusive. Using a reverse genetics approach, we identified PCIF1, a factor that interacts with the serine-5-phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, as a cap-specific adenosine methyltransferase (CAPAM) responsible for N 6-methylation of m6Am. The crystal structure of CAPAM in complex with substrates revealed the molecular basis of cap-specific m6A formation. A transcriptome-wide analysis revealed that N 6-methylation of m6Am promotes the translation of capped mRNAs. Thus, a cap-specific m6A writer promotes translation of mRNAs starting from m6Am. Mammalian WTAP is a regulatory subunit of the RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase. The methyltransferase\nimportant role in mRNA metabolism and functions. When adenosine is transcribed as the first cap-adjacent nucleotide, it is methylated at the ribose 2'-O and N6 positions, thus generating N6, 2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am). Phosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD)-interacting factor 1 (PCIF1) is a novel cap-specific adenine N6-methyltransferase responsible for m6Am formation. As PCIF1 specifically interacts with the Ser5-phosphorylated CTD of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), which is a marker for the early phase of transcription, PCIF1 is speculated to be recruited to the early elongating Pol II. In this study, subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that PCIF1 is mainly localized to the transcriptionally active chromatin regions in HeLa cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed that PCIF1 was predominantly localized to the promoter of a broad range of Pol II-transcribed genes, including several protein-coding genes and non-coding RNA genes. Moreover, PCIF1 accumulation on these promoters depended entirely on transcriptional activity and Ser5 phosphorylation of\nlevels in the indicated groups (n = 3). **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 by 1-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s multiple-comparison test. Interactome analysis of the human Cap-specific mRNA (nucleoside-2'-O-)-methyltransferase 1 (hMTr1) protein. In a previous study, we have shown that the gene promoter of a protein termed KIAA0082 is regulated by interferon and that this protein interacts with the RNA polymerase II. It has been subsequently shown that KIAA0082 is the human cap-specific messenger RNA (mRNA) (nucleoside-2'-O-)-methyltransferase 1 (hMTr1), which catalyzes methylation of the 2'-O -ribose of the first nucleotide of capped mRNAs. Pre-mRNAs are cotranscriptionally processed, requiring coordinate interactions or dissociations of hundreds of proteins. hMTr1 potentially binds to the 5'-end of the whole cellular pre-mRNA pool. Besides, it contains a WW protein interaction domain and thus is expected to be associated with several proteins. In this current study, we determined the composition of complexes isolated by hMTr1 immunoprecipitation\nand anti-PD-1 immunotherapy Effects of the m6Am methyltransferase PCIF1 on cell proliferation and survival in gliomas The comprehensive interactomes of human adenosine RNA methyltransferases and demethylases reveal distinct functional and regulatory features The mammalian cap-specific m6Am RNA methyltransferase PCIF1 regulates transcript levels in mouse tissues PCIF1-mediated deposition of 5\u2019-cap N6,2\u2019-O-dimethyladenosine in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA regulates susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection Mammalian WTAP is a regulatory subunit of the RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase Role of the unique N-terminal domain of CtBP2 in determining the subcellular localisation of CtBP family proteins MicroRNA-133a exerts tumor suppressive role in oral squamous cell carcinoma through the Notch signaling pathway via downregulation of CTBP2 TET2 as a tumor suppressor and therapeutic target in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia SNIP1 recruits TET2 to regulate c-MYC target genes and cellular DNA damage response TET2 suppresses VHL deficiency-driven clear cell renal cell carcinoma by inhibiting HIF signaling Tumor suppressor TET2 promotes\nN6-adenosine methylation m(6)A RNA methylation promotes XIST-mediated transcriptional repression Perturbation of m6A writers reveals two distinct classes of mRNA methylation at internal and 5\u2032 sites VIRMA mediates preferential m(6)A mRNA methylation in 3\u2032UTR and near stop codon and associates with alternative polyadenylation Identification of factors required for m6 A mRNA methylation in Arabidopsis reveals a role for the conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase HAKAI Zc3h13/Flacc is required for adenosine methylation by bridging the mRNA-binding factor Rbm15/Spenito to the m(6)A machinery component Wtap/Fl(2)d Mammalian WTAP is a regulatory subunit of the RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase Hakai is required for stabilization of core components of the m(6)A mRNA methylation machinery Role of Hakai in m(6)A modification pathway in Drosophila Sequence specificity of the human mRNA N6-adenosine methylase in vitro Cap-specific terminal N (6)-methylation of RNA by an RNA polymerase II-associated methyltransferase A novel synthesis and detection method for cap-associated adenosine modifications in mouse mRNA\nrelationships deduced for an effector function of the phosphorylated CTD. Role of PCIF1-mediated 5'-cap N6-methyladeonsine mRNA methylation in colorectal cancer and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Adenosine N6-methylation (m6A) and N6,2'-O-dimethylation (m6Am) are regulatory modifications of eukaryotic mRNAs. m6Am formation is catalyzed by the methyl transferase phosphorylated CTD-interacting factor 1 (PCIF1); however, the pathophysiological functions of this RNA modification and PCIF1 in cancers are unclear. Here, we show that PCIF1 expression is upregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) and negatively correlates with patient survival. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated depletion of PCIF1 in human CRC cells leads to loss of cell migration, invasion, and colony formation in vitro and loss of tumor growth in athymic mice. Pcif1 knockout in murine CRC cells inhibits tumor growth in immunocompetent mice and enhances the effects of anti-PD-1 antibody treatment by decreasing intratumoral TGF-\u03b2 levels and increasing intratumoral IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 levels, and tumor-infiltrating natural killer cells. We further show that PCIF1 modulates\ncytological, structural, and functional properties of human PCIF1. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that endogenous PCIF1 was colocalized with the phosphorylated Pol II and the transcription elongation factor DSIF in the cell nucleus. We also found that PCIF1 WW domain inhibits the CTD phosphatase activity of SCP1 in vitro. By examining the effect of either PCIF1 overexpression or knockdown on the transactivation of reporter gene expression by various transcriptional activation domains, we found that PCIF1 significantly repressed the transactivation depend on its CTD binding ability. These data suggest that PCIF1 modulates phosphorylation status of the CTD and negatively regulates gene expression by Pol II. The cap-specific m6A methyltransferase, PCIF1/CAPAM, is dynamically recruited to the gene promoter in a transcription-dependent manner. N 6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant modification in eukaryotic mRNAs, plays an important role in mRNA metabolism and functions. When adenosine is transcribed as the first cap-adjacent nucleotide, it is methylated at\nto the m7G cap in 30%\u201340% of mRNAs, more than those with m6A modification. Reversible and dynamic changes of mRNA m6Am play important roles in tumorigenesis through interfering with the stability, decapping, and translation of mRNA targets, including a variety of key oncogenes and tumor suppressors. The modification of m6Am is controlled by opposing activities of specific methyltransferases and demethylases. Phosphorylated RNA polymerase II CTD\u2013interacting factor 1 (PCIF1) is the sole known methyltransferase to catalyze the m6Am marks present in the m7G cap\u2013proximal nucleotide. However, it remains unknown whether modification of m6Am requires recruitment of cofactors to the target mRNA. On the other hand, fat mass\u2013 and obesity-associated protein (FTO) has been shown to preferentially demethylate cap m6Am of RNA transcripts. While the role of m6A modification in cancer biology is well known, the role of m6Am in tumor progression is still emerging.

These results illustrate how remodeling of the CTD phosphorylation array might influence the recruitment and dissociation of the capping enzymes during elongation. But how does the CTD structure itself dictate interactions with the RNA processing enzymes independent of the phosphorylation state? Using CTD-Ser5 phosphopeptides containing alanine substitutions at other positions of the heptad, we define essential roles for Tyr-1 and Pro-3 (but not Thr-4 or Pro-6) in the binding of Schizosaccharomyces pombe guanylyltransferase. Tyr-1 is also essential for binding and allosteric activation of mammalian guanylyltransferase by CTD Ser5-PO4, whereas alanine mutations of Pro-3 and Pro-6 reduce the affinity for the allosteric CTD-binding site. These are the first structure-activity relationships deduced for an effector function of the phosphorylated CTD.

To determine the independent prognostic value of CTBP2 in HNSCC, we first analyzed TCGA data. The results showed conspicuously higher CTBP2 expression in tumor tissues (Supplemental Figure 3A). The CTBP2 protein levels were also remarkably upregulated in HNSCC tissues from both cohorts (Supplemental Figure 3, B, C, I, and J). Importantly, a high CTBP2 protein level was significantly correlated with high tumor stage and tumor grade in cohort 1 (Supplemental Figure 3, D\u2013G), whereas a high CTBP2 protein level was significantly correlated with T classification, tumor stage, and lymph node metastasis status in cohort 2 (Supplemental Figure 3, K\u2013N). Meanwhile, there was a statistically significant difference in overall survival rates (P < 0.05) between patients with CTBP2-high and CTBP2-low tumors in both cohorts (Supplemental Figure 3, H and O).

Cells from the two dishes were combined, pelleted as one biological replicate, flash frozen and short-term stored at -80\u00b0C until affinity purification was performed. At least three independent biological replicates were prepared per cell line. AP was performed according to with minor modifications. Cell pellets were thawed on ice, lysed in 1.2 ml of lysis buffer per frozen pellet and homogenized with a 2 ml syringe and a 21 G \u00d7 1\u20131/2\u2019\u2019 needle followed by three cycles of sonication on ice (5s on, 10s off, amplitude 35, microtip). The insoluble part was removed by centrifugation 16 500 g 4\u00b0C 10 min. The supernatants (from two 100 mm cell culture dishes) were incubated with 150 \u03bcl of magnetic streptavidin beads (Dynabeads\u2122 MyOne\u2122 Streptavidin C1, Invitrogen) O/N\nfull-length CTBP2 (WT), CtBP-binding motif-1 (CB-1), CtBP-binding motif-2 (CB-2), CTBP2 without CtBP-binding motif-1 (\u0394CB-1), CTBP2 without CtBP-binding motif-2 (\u0394CB-2), and CTBP2 without CtBP-binding motif-1 or CtBP-binding motif-2 (\u0394CB-1/CB-2), were coexpressed with PCIF1 in SCC25 cells. PCIF1 was detected in the CtBP-binding motif-1 precipitates but not in other conditions, indicating that CtBP-binding motif-1 was responsible for the interactions with PCIF1 (Figure 3, D\u2013F). Next, our double immunofluorescent staining results revealed a strong colocalization of PCIF1 with CTBP2 in the nucleus of SCC25 cells using a confocal scanning laser microscope (Figure 3G). Additionally, correlation analysis revealed that PCIF1 is highly correlated with CTBP2 in TCGA data set (Figure 3H). Similarly, results from IHC assay demonstrated that the level of CTBP2 immunoreactivity was highly correlated with PCIF1 in both local cohorts (Figure 3, I and J). To determine the independent prognostic value of CTBP2 in HNSCC, we first analyzed TCGA data. The results\npromotes translation of mRNAs starting from m6Am. Mammalian WTAP is a regulatory subunit of the RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase. The methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3)-containing methyltransferase complex catalyzes the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) formation, a novel epitranscriptomic marker; however, the nature of this complex remains largely unknown. Here we report two new components of the human m6A methyltransferase complex, Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP) and methyltransferase like 14 (METTL14). WTAP interacts with METTL3 and METTL14, and is required for their localization into nuclear speckles enriched with pre-mRNA processing factors and for catalytic activity of the m6A methyltransferase in vivo. The majority of RNAs bound by WTAP and METTL3 in vivo represent mRNAs containing the consensus m6A motif. In the absence of WTAP, the RNA-binding capability of METTL3 is strongly reduced, suggesting that WTAP may function to regulate recruitment of the m6A methyltransferase complex to mRNA targets.

For example, Wang et al. reported that 172 of 2,811 m6Am-marked genes showed downregulated transcription. In our study, there is a lack of evidence supporting that m6Am modification is involved in the stability of mRNA. Rather, it inhibits the translation efficiency of target mRNA with m6Am modification. This discrepancy may be explained by different methods used in different studies. Hence, different functions attributed to m6Am require more systematic examination and clarification. The deposition of RNA modification often requires the corroboration of multiple proteins. For example, RNA m6A modification is catalyzed by protein complex formed by methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3), METTL14, and Wilms\u2019 tumor 1\u2013associating protein (WTAP). Moreover, METTL1 interacts with WD repeat\u2013containing protein 4 (WDR4) to mediate m7G transfer RNA modifications to promote mRNA translation. Here, we report that CTBP2 can interact with PCIF1 to regulate m6Am deposition in the\nthe NC group.

Prediction of interactions for the entire yeast proteome identified a large number of novel interactions, the majority of which co-localized or participated in the same processes. Our high confidence interaction network included both well-studied and uncharacterized proteins. Proteins with known function were involved in actin assembly and cell budding. Uncharacterized proteins interacted with proteins involved in reproduction and cell budding, thus providing putative biological roles for the uncharacterized proteins.CONCLUSION: AAC is a simple, yet powerful feature for predicting protein interactions, and can be used alone or in conjunction with protein domains to predict new and validate existing interactions. More importantly, AAC alone performs at par with existing, but more complex, features indicating the presence of sequence-level information that is predictive of interaction, but which is not necessarily restricted to domains.

Characterization of a highly conserved histone related protein, Ydl156w, and its functional associations using quantitative proteomic analyses. A significant challenge in biology is to functionally annotate novel and uncharacterized proteins. Several approaches are available for deducing the function of proteins in silico based upon sequence homology and physical or genetic interaction, yet this approach is limited to proteins with well-characterized domains, paralogs and/or orthologs in other species, as well as on the availability of suitable large-scale data sets. Here, we present a quantitative proteomics approach extending the protein network of core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, among which a novel associated protein, the previously uncharacterized Ydl156w, was identified. In order to predict the role of Ydl156w, we designed and applied integrative bioinformatics, quantitative proteomics and biochemistry approaches aiming to infer its function. Reciprocal analysis of Ydl156w protein interactions demonstrated a strong association with all four\nezrin. To date, the clinical relevance and functional role of SCYL3 in cancer remain uncharacterized. Herein, we uncover its crucial role in liver cancer progression. We show that it physically binds and regulates the stability and transactivating activity of ROCK2 leading to HCC tumor progression. Our data provide mechanistic insight that SCYL3-mediated ROCK2 protein stability plays a pivotal role in growth and metastasis of HCC cells. Targeting SCYL3/ROCK2 signaling cascade may be a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of HCC patients. SDH5, a gene required for flavination of succinate dehydrogenase, is mutated in paraganglioma. Mammalian mitochondria contain about 1100 proteins, nearly 300 of which are uncharacterized. Given the well-established role of mitochondrial defects in human disease, functional characterization of these proteins may shed new light on disease mechanisms. Starting with yeast as a model system, we investigated an uncharacterized but highly conserved mitochondrial protein (named here Sdh5). Both yeast and\ninteraction assays. In aggregate, these linkages describe the structure of large-scale networks, with the resulting yeast network composed of 3,875 linkages among 804 proteins, and the resulting pathogenic Escherichia coli network composed of 2,043 linkages among 828 proteins. The search of such networks for groups of uncharacterized, linked proteins led to the identification of 27 novel cellular systems from one nonpathogenic and three pathogenic bacterial genomes. Function prediction of uncharacterized proteins. Function prediction of uncharacterized protein sequences generated by genome projects has emerged as an important focus for computational biology. We have categorized several approaches beyond traditional sequence similarity that utilize the overwhelmingly large amounts of available data for computational function prediction, including structure-, association (genomic context)-, interaction (cellular context)-, process (metabolic context)-, and proteomics-experiment-based methods. Because they incorporate structural and experimental data that is not used in sequence-based methods, they can provide additional accuracy and reliability to protein function\nmethods focused on the fact that proteins sharing a significant number of interaction partners are likely to participate in common cellular processes as proposed by Jacq (2001). Recently, we have designed PRODISTIN, a method in which distance values between all protein pairs are computed from the number of common and specific interaction partners and used to build a classification tree. Functional classes are defined according to the tree topology and to the number of proteins sharing functional annotations. The functional predictions for yet uncharacterized proteins are then proposed based on their belonging to a particular functional class. An alternative method for predicting biological functions was proposed, which ranks protein pairs according to their probability for having the experimentally measured number of common interaction partners. A different method, which does not rely on common interaction partners was suggested by Vasquez et al.; it optimizes the annotations of uncharacterized proteins such as\na protein of unknown function, which was recently related to proteins involved in the progression of the cell cycle. Its partitioning in this particular class thus reinforces this recent experimental result and illustrates the adequacy of our method. Therefore, the method appears to not only group proteins involved in the same cellular processes but also to underline crosstalk between cellular processes. The protein classes built by the algorithm being biologically significant, we thus choose to assign them a functional annotation corresponding to the functions shared by at least 50% of the annotated proteins of the class. A new annotation procedure for uncharacterized proteins As already mentioned in the introduction, a popular annotation procedure for single uncharacterized proteins, once clusters of proteins are available, is the simple majority rule: the most frequent function, or those shared by more than d% of the annotated proteins in the class are assigned to proteins\nthis procedure is able to enhance the performances with respect to previous approaches. Finally, we propose a new annotation for 37 previously uncharacterized yeast proteins. Conclusion We believe that our results represent a significant improvement for the inference of cellular functions, that can be applied to other organism as well as to other type of interaction graph, such as genetic interactions. Background While more data become available, analyzing protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks appears as a particularly effective way to make functional predictions for proteins of unknown function. Most studies so far focused on the baker's yeast S. cerevisiae due to large available datasets, but recent experimental data for D. melanogaster will most probably broaden the field of investigations. It is therefore of crucial interest to develop reliable and efficient strategies allowing to infer a function to yet uncharacterized proteins based on interaction data. It was soon noticed that proteins of\nwas consequently verified by RNA-Seq experiments. Finally, using these approaches we generated a refined network of Ydl156w-associated proteins. Clustering proteins from interaction networks for the prediction of cellular functions Background Developing reliable and efficient strategies allowing to infer a function to yet uncharacterized proteins based on interaction networks is of crucial interest in the current context of high-throughput data generation. In this paper, we develop a new algorithm for clustering vertices of a protein-protein interaction network using a density function, providing disjoint classes. Results Applied to the yeast interaction network, the classes obtained appear to be biological significant. The partitions are then used to make functional predictions for uncharacterized yeast proteins, using an annotation procedure that takes into account the binary interactions between proteins inside the classes. We show that this procedure is able to enhance the performances with respect to previous approaches. Finally, we propose a new annotation for\nyeast as a model system, we investigated an uncharacterized but highly conserved mitochondrial protein (named here Sdh5). Both yeast and human Sdh5 interact with the catalytic subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, a component of both the electron transport chain and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Sdh5 is required for SDH-dependent respiration and for Sdh1 flavination (incorporation of the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor). Germline loss-of-function mutations in the human SDH5 gene, located on chromosome 11q13.1, segregate with disease in a family with hereditary paraganglioma, a neuroendocrine tumor previously linked to mutations in genes encoding SDH subunits. Thus, a mitochondrial proteomics analysis in yeast has led to the discovery of a human tumor susceptibility gene. Global functional atlas of Escherichia coli encompassing previously uncharacterized proteins. One-third of the 4,225 protein-coding genes of Escherichia coli K-12 remain functionally unannotated (orphans). Many map to distant clades such as Archaea, suggesting involvement in basic\nmetabolism (50%,1) ; RMD1 Meiosis (75%, 1) ; FIN1 Signal transduction (75%, 2) ; Differentiation (50%, 2) ; Predictions made by our method for 37 previously uncharacterized proteins (no annotation in SGD, version of February 3rd, 2004).

It was soon noticed that proteins of similar cellular functions tend to lie within a short distance in the interaction graph. Based on this property, Schwikowski et al. proposed a prediction method in which a protein of unknown function is assigned the three most frequent cellular functions represented among its direct interaction partners. This approach is strictly local, as it does not take into account the graph as a whole but only the immediate protein neighborhood. However, we have good reasons to believe that the organization of proteins inside the interactome goes beyond the one-step separation. Protein complexes and pathways are an example of more complicated relationships between proteins involved in a same biological process. Indeed, other methods focused on the fact that proteins sharing a significant number of interaction partners are likely to participate in common\nrely on common interaction partners was suggested by Vasquez et al.; it optimizes the annotations of uncharacterized proteins such as to minimize the number of interactions between proteins of different functional groups. These latter two approaches, while based on the interaction network, do not define any clusters of proteins. Biological knowledge teaches us that dense protein-protein interactions are the sign of the common involvement of those proteins in certain biological processes. We therefore tried to select dense classes of proteins sharing a high percentage of interactions in the interaction graph. Several clustering algorithms applied to protein interaction graphs have been proposed so far. They are based on a density function evaluated in each vertex x which is computed from the number of edges in its neighborhood. We adopted another approach, computing first an appropriate distance between vertices. Generally the length of a shortest path or the Czekanowski-Dice distance are used,\nthe functional annotations of their members following a classical majority rule. Finally, a refined annotation procedure is proposed to predict the cellular function(s) of uncharacterized proteins, taking into account the function(s) assigned to the class and the direct interaction partners of uncharacterized protein present within the class. Hence, interaction data is used at two levels (see figure 1): first to define the classes using our partitioning algorithm, but also to annotate uncharacterized proteins once the classes have been formed. Overall, the quality of the prediction will strongly depend on (a) the validity of the clustering algorithm which must reflect the biological reality, and (b) the annotation procedure within classes. Results Graph, classes and partitions We analyze the interaction network as a graph, such that proteins are the vertices and each interaction is an undirected edge. Our aim is to build clusters of proteins sharing a high percentage of interactions, as\nthe database and the web application are publicly available (https://github.com/ubioinformat/UPEfinder). Assigning function to yeast proteins by integration of technologies. Interpreting genome sequences requires the functional analysis of thousands of predicted proteins, many of which are uncharacterized and without obvious homologs. To assess whether the roles of large sets of uncharacterized genes can be assigned by targeted application of a suite of technologies, we used four complementary protein-based methods to analyze a set of 100 uncharacterized but essential open reading frames (ORFs) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins were subjected to affinity purification and mass spectrometry analysis to identify copurifying proteins, two-hybrid analysis to identify interacting proteins, fluorescence microscopy to localize the proteins, and structure prediction methodology to predict structural domains or identify remote homologies. Integration of the data assigned function to 48 ORFs using at least two of the Gene Ontology (GO) categories of biological process, molecular function, and\nfrom a list of binary protein-protein interactions.

In conclusion, the comparison with alternative methods proposed so far shows that our approach performs better and makes more reliable predictions. Discussion and conclusion We have proposed a new method to analyze the protein-protein interaction network grounded on the combination of a clustering algorithm of the vertices and a refined method allowing to assign a function to proteins of yet unknown function. This method builds classes of proteins which appear to be involved in the same or related biological process(es). Furthermore, the method proposes a number of highly biologically relevant classes that PRODISTIN was not able to pinpoint. The results of our method are very encouraging, since the improvement we propose is a very simple one and yields sizeable effects for a significant number of uncharacterized proteins.

Another improvement might come from using the extended classes of the clustering algorithm instead of the partitions, as the density of interactions inside the extended classes is higher than in the partitions.

Hydrodynamic properties of 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonic acid-solubilized channel were used to calculate the molecular mass of the channel. Velocity sedimentation in H2O or D2O gave a sharp peak with a sedimentation coefficient of 17.3 S. Gel filtration yielded a Stokes radius of 5.92 nm. These data indicate a multisubunit protein with a molecular mass of 193 kDa, calculated to contain 3.98 subunits. Together, these results demonstrate that Kir 2.2 channels are formed by the homotetrameric association of Kir 2.2 subunits and do not contain tightly associated auxiliary subunits. These studies suggest that Kir 2.2 channels differ in structure from related heterooctomeric ATP-sensitive K channels and heterotetrameric G-protein-regulated inward rectifier K channels.

BACKGROUND: Inherited forms of sinus node dysfunction (SND) clinically include bradycardia, sinus arrest, and chronotropic\nof this region is critical for inward rectifier function. G-protein mediated gating of inward-rectifier K+ channels. G-protein regulated inward-rectifier potassium channels (GIRK) are part of a superfamily of inward-rectifier K+ channels which includes seven family members. To date four GIRK subunits, designated GIRK1-4 (also designated Kir3.1-4), have been identified in mammals, and GIRK5 has been found in Xenopus oocytes. GIRK channels exist in vivo both as homotetramers and heterotetramers. In contrast to the other mammalian GIRK family members, GIRK1 can not form functional channels by itself and has to assemble with GIRK2, 3 or 4. As the name implies, GIRK channels are modulated by G-proteins; they are also modulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, intracellular sodium, ethanol and mechanical stretch. Recently a family of GTPase activating proteins known as regulators of G-protein signaling were shown to be the missing link for the fast deactivation kinetics of GIRK channels in native cells, which\nion channel signal transduction and supporting a channel-forming role for the GIRK3 subunit. Mutation of critical GIRK subunit residues disrupts N- and C-termini association and channel function. The subfamily of G-protein-linked inwardly rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs) is coupled to G-protein receptors throughout the CNS and in the heart. We used mutational analysis to address the role of a specific hydrophobic region of the GIRK1 subunit. Deletion of the GIRK1 C-terminal residues 330-384, as well as the point mutation I331R, resulted in a decrease in channel function when coexpressed with GIRK4 in oocytes and in COS-7 cells. Surface protein expression of GIRK1 I331R coexpressed with GIRK4 was comparable with wild type, indicating that subunits assemble and are correctly localized to the membrane. Subsequent mutation of homologous residues in both the GIRK4 subunit and Kir2.1 (Gbetagamma-independent inward rectifier) also resulted in a decrease in channel function. Intracellular domain associations resulted in the\nRectifying K+ Channel) Channel Function. BACKGROUND: Inherited forms of sinus node dysfunction (SND) clinically include bradycardia, sinus arrest, and chronotropic incompetence and may serve as disease models to understand sinus node physiology and impulse generation. Recently, a gain-of-function mutation in the G-protein gene GNB2 led to enhanced activation of the GIRK (G-protein activated inwardly rectifying K+ channel). Thus, human cardiac GIRK channels are important for heart rate regulation and subsequently, genes encoding their subunits Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 ( KCNJ3 and KCNJ5) are potential candidates for inherited SND in human.METHODS: We performed a combined approach of targeted sequencing of KCNJ3 and KCNJ5 in 52 patients with idiopathic SND and subsequent whole exome sequencing of additional family members in a genetically affected patient. A putative novel disease-associated gene variant was functionally analyzed by voltage-clamp experiments using various heterologous cell expression systems (Xenopus oocytes, CHO cells, and rat atrial cardiomyocytes).RESULTS: In a 3-generation\nsubunit and Kir2.1 (Gbetagamma-independent inward rectifier) also resulted in a decrease in channel function. Intracellular domain associations resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of the GIRK1 N and C termini and GIRK4 N and C termini. The point mutation I331R in the GIRK1 C terminus or L337R in the GIRK4 C terminus decreased the association between the N and C termini. Mutation of a GIRK1 N-terminal hydrophobic residue, predicted structurally to interact with the C-terminal domain, also resulted in a decrease in channel function and termini association. We hypothesize that the hydrophobic nature of this GIRK1 subunit region is critical for interaction between adjacent termini and is permissive for channel gating. In addition, the homologous mutation in cytoplasmic domains of Kir2.1 (L330R) did not disrupt association, suggesting that the overall structural integrity of this region is critical for inward rectifier function. G-protein mediated gating of inward-rectifier K+ channels. G-protein regulated inward-rectifier potassium\nchannels: their molecular heterogeneity and function. A variety of cells including cardiac myocytes and neuronal cells possess inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) channels through which currents flow more readily in the inward direction than outward. These K+ channels play pivotal roles in maintenance of the resting membrane potential, in regulation of the action potential duration, in receptor-dependent inhibition of cellular excitability, and in the secretion and absorption of K+ ions across cell membrane. Recent molecular biological dissection has shown that the DNAs encoding Kir channels constitute a new family of K+ channels whose subunits contain two putative transmembrane domains and a pore-forming region. So far, more than ten cDNAs of Kir channel subunits have been isolated and classified into four subfamilies: 1) IRK subfamily (IRK1-3/Kir1.1-1.3), 2) GIRK subfamily (GIRK1-4/Kir3.1-3.4), 3) ATP-dependent Kir subfamily (ROMK1/Kir1.1, K(AB)-2/Kir4.1), and 4) ATP-sensitive Kir subfamily (uKATP-1/Kir6.1, BIR/Kir6.2). Xenopus oocytes injected with the cRNAs of IRKs elicit\nnot yet been cloned. In this review, we overviewed the current understandings of the features of the molecular structures and functions of the four main subfamilies of Kir channels. Direct activation of inward rectifier potassium channels by PIP2 and its stabilization by Gbetagamma. Inward rectifier K+ channels, which modulate electrical activity in many cell types, are regulated by protein kinases, guanine-nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and probably actin cytoskeleton. Generation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) by ATP-dependent lipid kinases is known to activate inward rectifier K+ channels in cardiac membrane patches. Here we report that several cloned inward rectifier K+ channels directly bind PIP2, and that this binding correlates with channel activity. Application of ATP or PIP2 liposomes activates the cloned channels. Stabilized by lipid phosphatase inhibitors, PIP2 antibodies potently inhibit each channel with a unique rate (GIRK1/4 approximately GIRK2 >> IRK1 approximately ROMK. Consistent with the faster dissociation of PIP2 from\ncurrents by PIP2 antibodies by more than 10-fold. Thus Gbetagamma activates GIRK channels by stabilizing interactions between PIP2 and the K+ channel. Galphai1 and Galphai3 differentially interact with, and regulate, the G protein-activated K+ channel. G protein-activated K(+) channels (GIRKs; Kir3) are activated by direct binding of Gbetagamma subunits released from heterotrimeric G proteins. In native tissues, only pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins of the G(i/o) family, preferably Galpha(i3) and Galpha(i2), are donors of Gbetagamma for GIRK. How this specificity is achieved is not known. Here, using a pull-down method, we confirmed the presence of Galpha(i3-GDP) binding site in the N terminus of GIRK1 and identified novel binding sites in the N terminus of GIRK2 and in the C termini of GIRK1 and GIRK2. The non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate, reduced the binding of Galpha(i3) by a factor of 2-4. Galpha(i1-GDP) bound to GIRK1 and GIRK2 much weaker than Galpha(i3-GDP). Titrated\nGbetagamma-activated inwardly rectifying K(+) (GIRK) channel activation kinetics via Galphai and Galphao-coupled receptors are determined by Galpha-specific interdomain interactions that affect GDP release rates. Gbetagamma-activated inwardly rectifying K(+) (GIRK) channels have distinct gating properties when activated by receptors coupled specifically to Galpha(o) versus Galpha(i) subunit isoforms, with Galpha(o)-coupled currents having approximately 3-fold faster agonist-evoked activation kinetics. To identify the molecular determinants in Galpha subunits mediating these kinetic differences, chimeras were constructed using pertussis toxin (PTX)-insensitive Galpha(oA) and Galpha(i2) mutant subunits (Galpha(oA(C351G)) and Galpha(i2(C352G))) and examined in PTX-treated Xenopus oocytes expressing muscarinic m2 receptors and Kir3.1/3.2a channels. These experiments revealed that the alpha-helical N-terminal region (amino acids 1-161) and the switch regions of Galpha(i2) (amino acids 162-262) both partially contribute to slowing the GIRK activation time course when compared with the Galpha(oA(C351G))-coupled response. When present together, they fully reproduce Galpha(i2(C352G))-coupled GIRK kinetics. The Galpha(i2) C-terminal region (amino acids 263-355) had no\nactivation kinetics are due to intrinsic differences in receptor-catalyzed GDP release that rate-limit Gbetagamma production and is attributed to heterogeneity in Galpha(i) and Galpha(o) interdomain contacts. Evidence for oligomerization between GABAB receptors and GIRK channels containing the GIRK1 and GIRK3 subunits. The stimulation of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors, such as \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA(B) ) receptors, activates G protein-gated inwardly-rectifying K(+) (GIRK) channels, which influence membrane excitability. There is now evidence suggesting that G protein-coupled receptors and G protein-gated inwardly-rectifying K(+) [GIRK/family 3 of inwardly-rectifying K(+) (Kir3)] channels do not diffuse freely within the plasma membrane, but instead there are direct protein-protein interactions between them. Here, we used bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, co-immunoprecipitation, confocal and electron microscopy techniques to investigate the oligomerization of GABA(B) receptors with GIRK channels containing the GIRK3 subunit, whose contribution to functional channels is still unresolved. Co-expression of GABA(B) receptors and GIRK channels in human embryonic\nheart. Electrophysiological studies of channels expressed in heterologous systems have suggested that the pore-conducting pathway contains four subunits. However, inferences from electrophysiological studies have not been tested on native channels and do not address the possibility of nonconducting auxiliary subunits. Here, we investigate the subunit stoichiometry of endogenous inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir 2.2 (IRK2) from rat brain. Using chemical cross-linking, immunoprecipitiation, and velocity sedimentation, we report physical evidence demonstrating the tetrameric organization of the native channel. Kir 2.2 was sequentially cross-linked to produce bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis corresponding in size to monomer, dimer, trimer, and three forms of tetramer. Fully cross-linked channel was present as a single band of tetrameric size. Immunoprecipitation of biotinylated membranes revealed a single band corresponding to Kir 2.2, suggesting that the channel is composed of a single type of subunit. Hydrodynamic properties of 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonic acid-solubilized channel were used to calculate the molecular\nsignaling were shown to be the missing link for the fast deactivation kinetics of GIRK channels in native cells, which contrast with the slow kinetics observed in heterologously expressed channels. GIRK1, 2 and 3 are highly abundant in brain, while GIRK4 has limited distribution. Here, GIRK1/2 seems to be the predominant heterotetramer. In general, neuronal GIRK channels are involved in the regulation of the excitability of neurons and may contribute to the resting potential. Interestingly, only the GIRK1 and 4 subunits are distributed in the atrial and sinoatrial node cells of the heart and are involved in the regulation of cardiac rate. Our main objective of this review is to assess the current understanding of the G-protein modulation of GIRK channels and their physiological importance in mammals. Inwardly rectifying potassium channels: their molecular heterogeneity and function. A variety of cells including cardiac myocytes and neuronal cells possess inwardly rectifying K+\nby voltage-clamp experiments using various heterologous cell expression systems (Xenopus oocytes, CHO cells, and rat atrial cardiomyocytes).RESULTS: In a 3-generation family with SND we identified a novel variant in KCNJ5 which leads to an amino acid substitution (p.Trp101Cys) in the first transmembrane domain of the Kir3.4 subunit of the cardiac GIRK channel. The identified variant cosegregated with the disease in the family and was absent in the Exome Variant Server and Exome Aggregation Consortium databases. Expression of mutant Kir3.4 (\u00b1native Kir3.1) in different heterologous cell expression systems resulted in increased GIRK currents ( IK,ACh) and a reduced inward rectification which was not compensated by intracellular spermidine. Moreover, in silico modeling of heterotetrameric mutant GIRK channels indicates a structurally altered binding site for spermine.CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, an inherited gain-of-function mutation in the human GIRK3.4 causes familial human SND. The increased activity of GIRK channels is likely to lead to\nwith the disease has been described to date. Three-dimensional modeling was used to predict the structure of the KCNJ9 protein using the known structure of its homologs. According to the predictions, Phe326Ser change possibly disrupts the hydrophobic contacts with the valine side chain. Destabilization of the neighboring structures may undermine the formation of GIRK2/GIRK3 tetramers necessary for their proper functioning.CONCLUSIONS: We believe that the identified variant may be the cause of the disease in this patient but further studies, including the search for other patients with the KCNJ9 variants, are needed. Tetrameric subunit structure of the native brain inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir 2.2. Strongly inwardly rectifying potassium channels of the Kir 2 subfamily (IRK1, IRK2, and IRK3) are involved in maintenance and modulation of cell excitability in brain and heart. Electrophysiological studies of channels expressed in heterologous systems have suggested that the pore-conducting pathway contains four subunits. However, inferences\nKir subfamily (ROMK1/Kir1.1, K(AB)-2/Kir4.1), and 4) ATP-sensitive Kir subfamily (uKATP-1/Kir6.1, BIR/Kir6.2). Xenopus oocytes injected with the cRNAs of IRKs elicit classical Kir channel currents. GIRKs, as heteromultimers, compose the G protein-gated Kir (KG) channels, which are regulated by a variety of Gi/Go-coupled inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors such as m2-mus-carinic, serotonergic (5HT1A), GABAB, somatostatin and opioid (mu, delta, kappa) receptors. ROMK1 and KAB-2 are characterized with a Walker type-A ATP-binding motif in their carboxyl termini, and may be involved in K+ transport in renal epithelial and brain glial cells. uKATP-1 and BIR form with sulfonylurea receptors, the so-called ATP-sensitive K+ channels. Thus, it is a feature of the Kir channel family that each subfamily plays a specific physiological functional role. The (Na+)-activated Kir channels identified electrophysiologically in neurons and cardiac myocytes have not yet been cloned. In this review, we overviewed the current understandings of the features of the molecular structures and\nchannel with a unique rate (GIRK1/4 approximately GIRK2 >> IRK1 approximately ROMK. Consistent with the faster dissociation of PIP2 from the GIRK channels, the carboxy terminus of GIRK1 binds 3H-PIP2 liposomes more weakly than does that of IRK1 or ROMK1. Mutation of a conserved arginine to glutamine at position 188 reduces the ability of ROMK1 to bind PIP2 and increases its sensitivity to inhibition by PIP2 antibodies. Interactions between GIRK channels and PIP2 are modulated by the betagamma subunits of the G protein (Gbetagamma). When GIRK1/4 channels are allowed to run down completely, they are not activated by addition of Gbetagamma alone, but application of PIP2 activates them in minutes without Gbetagamma and in just seconds with Gbetagamma. Finally, coexpression of Gbetagamma with GIRK channels slows the inhibition of K+ currents by PIP2 antibodies by more than 10-fold. Thus Gbetagamma activates GIRK channels by stabilizing interactions between PIP2 and the\nGIRK3 subunit, whose contribution to functional channels is still unresolved. Co-expression of GABA(B) receptors and GIRK channels in human embryonic kidney-293 cells in combination with co-immunoprecipitation experiments established that the metabotropic receptor forms stable complexes with GIRK channels. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, we have shown that, in living cells under physiological conditions, GABA(B) receptors interact directly with GIRK1/GIRK3 heterotetramers. In addition, we have provided evidence that the receptor-effector complexes are also found in vivo and identified that the cerebellar granule cells are one neuron population where the interaction probably takes place. Altogether, our data show that signalling complexes containing GABA(B) receptors and GIRK channels are formed shortly after biosynthesis, probably in the endoplasmic reticulum and/or endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus complex, suggesting that this might be a general feature of receptor-effector ion channel signal transduction and supporting a channel-forming role for the GIRK3 subunit. Mutation of critical GIRK subunit residues disrupts\nthe binding of Galpha(i3) by a factor of 2-4. Galpha(i1-GDP) bound to GIRK1 and GIRK2 much weaker than Galpha(i3-GDP). Titrated expression of components of signaling pathway in Xenopus oocytes and their activation by m2 muscarinic receptors revealed that G(i3) activates GIRK more efficiently than G(i1), as indicated by larger and faster agonist-evoked currents. Activation of GIRK by purified Gbetagamma in excised membrane patches was strongly augmented by coexpression of Galpha(i3) and less by Galpha(i1). Differences in physical interactions of GIRK with GDP-bound Galpha subunits, or Galphabetagamma heterotrimers, may dictate different extents of Galphabetagamma anchoring, influence the efficiency of GIRK activation by Gbetagamma, and play a role in determining signaling specificity. De Novo Variant in the KCNJ9 Gene as a Possible Cause of Neonatal Seizures. BACKGROUND: The reduction in next-generation sequencing (NGS) costs allows for using this method for newborn screening for monogenic diseases (MDs). In this report, we describe a\nGalpha(oA(C351G))-coupled response. When present together, they fully reproduce Galpha(i2(C352G))-coupled GIRK kinetics. The Galpha(i2) C-terminal region (amino acids 263-355) had no significant effect on GIRK kinetics. Complementary responses were observed with chimeras substituting the Galpha(o) switch regions into the Galpha(i2(C352G)) subunit, which partially accelerated the GIRK activation rate. The Galpha(oA)/Galpha(i2) chimera results led us to examine an interaction between the alpha-helical domain and the Ras-like domain previously implicated in mediating a 4-fold slower in vitro basal GDP release rate in Galpha(i1) compared with Galpha(o). Mutations disrupting the interdomain contact in Galpha(i2(C352G)) at either the alphaD-alphaE loop (R145A) or the switch III loop (L233Q/A236H/E240T/M241T), significantly accelerated the GIRK activation kinetics consistent with the Galpha(i2) interdomain interface regulating receptor-catalyzed GDP release rates in vivo. We propose that differences in Galpha(i) versus Galpha(o)-coupled GIRK activation kinetics are due to intrinsic differences in receptor-catalyzed GDP release that rate-limit Gbetagamma production and is attributed to heterogeneity\nmutation in the human GIRK3.4 causes familial human SND. The increased activity of GIRK channels is likely to lead to a sustained hyperpolarization of pacemaker cells and thereby reduces heart rate. Modulation of human GIRK channels may pave a way for further treatment of cardiac pacemaking.",

A block to mRNA nuclear export in S. cerevisiae leads\ntristetraprolin mechanistically functions, we biopanned with a phage-display library for proteins that interact with tristetraprolin and retrieved, among others, a fragment of poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1, which assists in the 3'-polyadenylation of mRNA by binding to immature poly(A) tails and thereby increases the activity of poly(A) polymerase, which is directly responsible for polyadenylation. The tristetraprolin/poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 interaction was characterized using tristetraprolin and poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 deletion mutants in pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Tristetraprolin interacted with the carboxyl-terminal region of poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 via its tandem zinc finger domain and another region. Although tristetraprolin and poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 are located in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, they interacted in vivo in only the nucleus. In vitro, tristetraprolin bound both poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 and poly(A) polymerase and thereby inhibited polyadenylation of AU-rich element-containing mRNAs encoding tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, GM-CSF, and interleukin-10.

Structure and function of the C-terminal PABC domain of human\npoly(A) binding protein, Paip2. The eukaryotic mRNA 3' poly(A) tail acts synergistically with the 5' cap structure to enhance translation. This effect is mediated by a bridging complex, composed of the poly(A) binding protein (PABP), eIF4G, and the cap binding protein, eIF4E. PABP-interacting protein 1 (Paip1) is another factor that interacts with PABP to coactivate translation. Here, we describe a novel human PABP-interacting protein (Paip2), which acts as a repressor of translation both in vitro and in vivo. Paip2 preferentially inhibits translation of a poly(A)-containing mRNA, but has no effect on the translation of hepatitis C virus mRNA, which is cap- and eIF4G-independent. Paip2 decreases the affinity of PABP for polyadenylate RNA, and disrupts the repeating structure of poly(A) ribonucleoprotein. Furthermore, Paip2 competes with Paip1 for PABP binding. Thus, Paip2 inhibits translation by interdicting PABP function. Proteomic analysis reveals that wildtype and alanine-expanded nuclear poly(A)-binding protein exhibit differential interactions in\nassociation of the translation factors polyadenylate-binding protein-1 (PABP) and eIF4G is essential for high-level expression of polyadenylated mRNAs.

Our NMR and crystallographic data show that eIF4G interacts with the RRM2 domain of PABP. Analysis of the interaction by small-angle X-ray scattering, isothermal titration calorimetry, and electromobility shift assays reveals that this interaction is allosterically regulated by poly(A) binding to PABP. Furthermore, we have confirmed the importance of poly(A) for the endogenous PABP and eIF4G interaction in immunoprecipitation experiments using HeLa cell extracts. Our findings reveal interdomain allostery as a mechanism for cooperative assembly of RNP complexes. Paip1 interacts with poly(A) binding protein through two independent binding motifs.

A newly identified N-terminal amino acid sequence of human eIF4G binds poly(A)-binding protein and functions in poly(A)-dependent translation. The yeast poly(A)-binding protein Pab1p stimulates in vitro poly(A)-dependent and cap-dependent translation by distinct mechanisms.

Paip1 interacts with poly(A)-binding protein\npolymerase and thereby inhibited polyadenylation of AU-rich element-containing mRNAs encoding tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, GM-CSF, and interleukin-10. A tandem zinc finger domain-deleted tristetraprolin mutant was a less effective inhibitor. Expression of a tristetraprolin mutant restricted to the nucleus resulted in downregulation of an AU-rich element-containing tumor necrosis factor \u03b1/luciferase mRNA construct.CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: In addition to its known cytosolic mRNA-degrading function, tristetraprolin inhibits poly(A) tail synthesis by interacting with poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 in the nucleus to regulate expression of AU-rich element-containing mRNA. Nuclear poly(A) binding protein 1 (PABPN1) and Matrin3 interact in muscle cells and regulate RNA processing. The polyadenylate binding protein 1 (PABPN1) is a ubiquitously expressed RNA binding protein vital for multiple steps in RNA metabolism.

Autoregulation of poly(A)-binding protein synthesis in vitro. Translational control of poly(A)-binding protein expression. Negative control of the poly(A)-binding protein mRNA translation is mediated by the adenine-rich region of its 5'-untranslated\nwith the polyadenylation complex; it initially interacts with CPEB, but after polyadenylation, it binds the poly(A) tail. ePAB dissociation from CPEB is regulated by RINGO (Rapid Inducer of G(2)/M progression in Oocytes), a cyclin B1-like cofactor that activates cdk1, a protein kinase that phosphorylates CPEB. Subsequent ePAB binding to the poly(A) tail is necessary to protect the homopolymer from degradation by deadenylating enzymes. Poly(A)-bound ePAB also interacts with eIF4G, which instigates translation initiation of CPEB-bound mRNAs. Promiscuous modification of the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein by multiple protein-arginine methyltransferases does not affect the aggregation behavior. The mammalian nuclear poly(A)-binding protein, PABPN1, carries 13 asymmetrically dimethylated arginine residues in its C-terminal domain. By fractionation of cell extracts, we found that protein-arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs)-1, -3, and -6 are responsible for the modification of PABPN1.

The yeast\ninhibits translation by interdicting PABP function. Proteomic analysis reveals that wildtype and alanine-expanded nuclear poly(A)-binding protein exhibit differential interactions in skeletal muscle. Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset, primarily autosomal dominant disease caused by a short GCN expansion in the PABPN1 (polyadenylate-binding protein nuclear 1) gene that results in an alanine expansion at the N terminus of the PABPN1 protein. Expression of alanine-expanded PABPN1 is linked to the formation of nuclear aggregates in tissues from individuals with OPMD. However, as with other nuclear aggregate-associated diseases, controversy exists over whether these aggregates are the direct cause of pathology. An emerging hypothesis is that a loss of PABPN1 function and/or aberrant protein interactions contribute to pathology in OPMD. Here, we present the first global proteomic analysis of the protein interactions of WT and alanine-expanded PABPN1 in skeletal muscle tissue. These data provide both insight into the function of PABPN1 in muscle\npoly(A)-binding activity and in the absence of a poly(A) tail. With the exception of the yeast requirement that Pab1p be bound to poly(A) in order to interact with eIF4G, this implies that, at least with respect to translational stimulation, poly(A) simply provides a binding site for PABP. The failure of yeast Pab1p to function in the absence of bound poly(A) may reflect the selective inability of yeast eIF4G to stabilize the packing of poly(A)-associated RRMs 1 and 2 in a manner comparable to that achieved by the eIF4Gs of other species. Tethered function assays also reveal that RRMs 1 and 2, or RRMs 3 and 4, of Xenopus PABP are as capable of translational stimulation as the full-length protein, despite the fact that RRMs 3 and 4 lack the ability to interact with eIF4G or Paip1.

Multiple functions for the poly(A)-binding protein in mRNA decapping and deadenylation in yeast. Decapping of stabilized, polyadenylated mRNA in yeast pab1 mutants. mRNA stabilization by poly(A) binding protein is independent of poly(A) and requires translation. The poly(A)-poly(A)-binding protein complex is a major determinant of mRNA stability in vitro. The poly(A) tail inhibits the assembly of a 3'-to-5' exonuclease in an in vitro RNA stability system. Poly(A)-binding proteins regulate both mRNA deadenylation and decapping in yeast cytoplasmic extracts. An mRNA stability complex functions with poly(A)-binding protein to stabilize mRNA in vitro. The deadenylating nuclease (DAN) is involved in poly(A) tail removal during the meiotic maturation of Xenopus oocytes. The poly(A)-binding protein and an mRNA stability protein jointly regulate an endoribonuclease activity. Two distinct destabilizing elements in the c-fos message trigger deadenylation as a first\nfor the RNA helicase eIF4A. Not surprisingly, Paip1 also interacts with eIF4A, and is capable of stimulating the translation of a reporter mRNA when overexpressed in cultured cells. Paip2, a low-molecular-weight acidic protein, binds PABP at two sites, one in RRMs 2 and 3 and one in the carboxyl terminus. Binding of Paip2 to the RRM2-3 region competes effectively for binding of Paip1 to PABP, reduces PABP binding to poly(A), and inhibits the translation of polyadenylated mRNA. Tethered-function assays in yeast and Xenopus that exploit PABP fusions to the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein also underscore the intricate nature of PABP's stimulatory effects on translation. PABP tethered at specific MS2 coat binding sites stimulates translation of a reporter mRNA in cis, but not in trans, and can do so without its poly(A)-binding activity and in the absence of a poly(A) tail. With the exception of the yeast requirement that Pab1p be\nof ubiquitin-protein ligases, but there is no evidence that PABPs play any role in protein degradation. The carboxy-terminal domain is, however, the site of interaction with factors regulating polyadenylation, deadenylation, translation initiation, and translation termination (see below). Nuclear PABPs The structure of the nuclear PABPs is not as well understood as that of the cytoplasmic PABPs, largely because crystal and NMR structures have yet to be determined, but it is known that they typically have an acidic amino terminus followed by a single RRM and an arginine-rich carboxy-terminal domain. Recognition of poly(A) requires both the RRM and the arginine-rich domain. A run of alanines in PABN1 is expanded in the recessive disease oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (see Figure 2). In yeast, the nuclear PABP is essential for viability and is encoded by the NAB2 gene. Unlike other poly(A)-binding proteins, Nab2p uses an Arg-Gly-Gly (RGG) domain for binding. This protein also contains\nbinding of the Lsm1-7p-Pat1p complex, and decapping by the decapping proteins Dcp1p and Dcp2p, and subsequent (h) 5'-to-3' degradation of the mRNA by the exonuclease Xrn1p or (i) 3'-to-5' degradation by the exosome.

        "desc": "cell growth under nutritional stress. The recent discovery of TA loci in obligatory intracellular species of the Rickettsia genus has prompted new research to establish whether they work as stress response elements or as addiction systems that might be toxic for the host cell. VapBC2 is a TA locus from R. felis, a pathogen responsible for flea-borne spotted fever in humans. The VapC2 toxin is a PIN-domain protein, whereas the antitoxin, VapB2, belongs to the family of swapped-hairpin \u03b2-barrel DNA-binding proteins. We have used a combination of biophysical and structural methods to characterize this new toxin/antitoxin pair. Our results show how VapB2 can block the VapC2 toxin. They provide a first structural description of the interaction between a swapped-hairpin \u03b2-barrel protein and DNA. Finally, these results suggest how the VapC2/VapB2 molar ratio can control the self-regulation of the TA locus transcription. Structure-function analysis of VapB4 antitoxin identifies critical features of\nspecificity of VapB1 by making a mutation that would allow it to neutralize its noncognate toxin. A mutation in VapB1 to contain the tryptophan residue identified herein as important in the VapB2-VapC2 interaction resulted in a VapB1 mutant (the T47W mutant) that binds to and neutralizes both its cognate VapC1 and noncognate VapC2 toxins. This represents the first example of a single mutation causing relaxed specificity in a type II antitoxin.IMPORTANCE: Toxin-antitoxin systems are of particular concern in pathogenic organisms, such as nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, as they can elicit dormancy and persistence, leading to chronic infections and failure of antibiotic treatment. Despite the importance of the TA interaction, the specificity determinants for VapB-VapC complex formation remain uncharacterized. Thus, our understanding of how antitoxins control toxin-induced dormancy and bacterial persistence requires thorough investigation of antitoxin specificity for its cognate toxin. This study characterizes the crucial residues of the VapB2 antitoxin from\nthorough investigation of antitoxin specificity for its cognate toxin. This study characterizes the crucial residues of the VapB2 antitoxin from NTHi necessary for its interaction with VapC2 and provides the first example of a single amino acid change altering the toxin specificity of an antitoxin. Mechanism of regulation and neutralization of the AtaR-AtaT toxin-antitoxin system. GCN5-related N-acetyl-transferase (GNAT)-like enzymes from toxin-antitoxin modules are strong inhibitors of protein synthesis. Here, we present the bases of the regulatory mechanisms of ataRT, a model GNAT-toxin-antitoxin module, from toxin synthesis to its action as a transcriptional de-repressor. We show the antitoxin (AtaR) traps the toxin (AtaT) in a pre-catalytic monomeric state and precludes the effective binding of ac-CoA and its target Met-transfer RNAfMet. In the repressor complex, AtaR intrinsically disordered region interacts with AtaT at two different sites, folding into different structures, that are involved in two separate functional roles, toxin neutralization and placing\nnutrient starvation or antibiotic treatment, cellular proteases degrade the antitoxin, and the toxin functions to arrest bacterial growth. We characterized the specificity determinants of the interactions between VapB antitoxins and VapC toxins from nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) in an effort to gain a better understanding of how antitoxins control toxin activity and bacterial persistence. We studied truncated and full-length antitoxins with single amino acid mutations in the toxin-binding domain. Coexpressing the toxin and antitoxin in Escherichia coli and measuring bacterial growth by dilution plating assayed the ability of the mutant antitoxins to neutralize the toxin. Our results identified two single amino acid residues (W48 and F52) in the C-terminal region of the VapB2 antitoxin necessary for its ability to neutralize its cognate VapC2 toxin. Additionally, we attempted to alter the specificity of VapB1 by making a mutation that would allow it to neutralize its noncognate toxin. A mutation in VapB1\nVapBC toxin-antitoxin family. We tested a spectrum of pair-wise combinations of cognate and noncognate Mtb toxin-antitoxins using in vivo toxicity and rescue experiments along with in vitro interaction experiments. Surprisingly, we uncovered several examples of noncognate toxin-antitoxin association, even among different families (e.g. MazF toxins and VapB antitoxins). These results challenge the \"one toxin for one antitoxin\" dogma and suggest that M. tuberculosis may enlist a sophisticated toxin-antitoxin network to alter its physiology in response to environmental cues. Structural Determinants for Antitoxin Identity and Insulation of Cross Talk between Homologous Toxin-Antitoxin Systems. Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are ubiquitous in bacteria and archaea, where they play a pivotal role in the establishment and maintenance of dormancy. Under normal growth conditions, the antitoxin neutralizes the toxin. However, under conditions of stress, such as nutrient starvation or antibiotic treatment, cellular proteases degrade the antitoxin, and the toxin functions to arrest bacterial growth. We characterized\nRapid Identification of Secondary Structure and Binding Site Residues in an Intrinsically Disordered Protein Segment. Mycobacterium tuberculosis harbours nine toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems of the MazEF family. MazEF TA modules are of immense importance due to the perceived role of the MazF toxin in M. tuberculosis persistence and disease. The MazE antitoxin has a disordered C-terminal domain that binds the toxin, MazF and neutralizes its endoribonuclease activity. However, the structure of most MazEF TA complexes remains unsolved till date, obscuring structural and functional information about the antitoxins. We present a facile method to identify toxin binding residues on the disordered antitoxin. Charged residue scanning mutagenesis was used to screen a yeast surface displayed MazE6 antitoxin library against its purified cognate partner, the MazF6 toxin. Binding residues were deciphered by probing the relative reduction in binding to the ligand by flow cytometry. We have used this to identify putative antitoxin interface residues\nrelative reduction in binding to the ligand by flow cytometry. We have used this to identify putative antitoxin interface residues and local structure attained by the antitoxin upon interaction in the MazEF6 TA system and the same methodology is readily applicable to other intrinsically disordered protein regions. Structure-function studies of Escherichia coli RnlA reveal a novel toxin structure involved in bacteriophage resistance. Escherichia coli RnlA-RnlB is a newly identified toxin-antitoxin (TA) system that plays a role in bacteriophage resistance. RnlA functions as a toxin with mRNA endoribonuclease activity and the cognate antitoxin RnlB inhibits RnlA toxicity in E. coli cells. Interestingly, T4 phage encodes the antitoxin Dmd, which acts against RnlA to promote its own propagation, suggesting that RnlA-Dmd represents a novel TA system. Here, we have determined the crystal structure of RnlA refined to 2.10 (Dmd-binding domain), which is an organization not previously observed among known toxin structures. Small-angle\nmolar ratio can control the self-regulation of the TA locus transcription. Structure-function analysis of VapB4 antitoxin identifies critical features of a minimal VapC4 toxin-binding module. UNLABELLED: Bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems play a critical role in the regulation of gene expression, leading to developmental changes, reversible dormancy, and cell death. Type II toxin-antitoxin pairs, composed of protein toxins and antitoxins, exist in nearly all bacteria and are classified into six groups on the basis of the structure of the toxins. The VapBC group comprises the most common type II system and, like other toxin-antitoxin systems, functions to elicit dormancy by inhibiting protein synthesis. Activation of toxin function requires protease degradation of the VapB antitoxin, which frees the VapC toxin from the VapBC complex, allowing it to hydrolyze the RNAs required for translation. Generally, type II antitoxins bind with high specificity to their cognate toxins via a toxin-binding domain and endow the complex\ninterface of the PaParDE1 TA system, guided by an X-ray crystal structure, to determine contributions of antitoxin amino acids to interaction kinetics and affinity. These studies identified a \"hotspot\" position that alters the binding mode and resulting affinity (KD) from 152 pM for a 1:1 model for wild type to 25.5 and 626 nM for a 2:1 model with mutated antitoxin. This correlates with an altered induced secondary structure upon complexation with PaParE1 and increased kinetics of Lon protease digestion of the antitoxin despite the toxin presence. However, the decreased affinity at this hotspot was essentially reversed when the antitoxin dimerization region was deleted, yielding insights into complex interactions involved in the tight association. Removal of the antitoxin C-terminal seven amino acids, corresponding to the site of a disorder-to-order transition, completely prevents association. These studies combine to provide a model for the initiation of the TA interaction and highlight how\ndifferent TA families (MazF1Bif toxin and RelBBif antitoxin) in JDM301. This work provides insight into the regulatory mechanisms of TA systems implicated in the stress responses of bifidobacteria. ParD Antitoxin Hotspot Alters a Disorder-to-Order Transition upon Binding to Its Cognate ParE Toxin, Lessening Its Interaction Affinity and Increasing Its Protease Degradation Kinetics. Type-II toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are comprised of two tightly interacting proteins, and operons encoding these systems have been identified throughout the genomes of bacteria. In contrast to secretion system effector-immunity pairs, TA systems must remain paired to protect the host cell from toxicity. Continual depletion of the antitoxin results in a shorter half-life than that of the toxin, though it is unclear if antitoxins can be effectively degraded when complexed with toxins. The current work probed the protein-protein interface of the PaParDE1 TA system, guided by an X-ray crystal structure, to determine contributions of antitoxin amino acids to\ncompletely prevents association. These studies combine to provide a model for the initiation of the TA interaction and highlight how manipulation of the sequence can impact the antitoxin disorder-to-order transition, weakening the affinity and resulting in increased antitoxin susceptibility to degradation. Comprehensive Functional Analysis of the 18 Vibrio cholerae N16961 Toxin-Antitoxin Systems Substantiates Their Role in Stabilizing the Superintegron. UNLABELLED: The role of chromosomal toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems, which are ubiquitous within the genomes of free-living bacteria, is still debated. We have scanned the Vibrio cholerae N16961 genome for class 2 TA genes and identified 18 gene pair candidates. Interestingly, all but one are located in the chromosome 2 superintegron (SI). The single TA found outside the SI is located on chromosome 1 and is related to the well-characterized HipAB family, which is known to play a role in antibiotic persistence. We investigated this clustering within the SI and its possible\nat two different sites, folding into different structures, that are involved in two separate functional roles, toxin neutralization and placing the DNA-binding domains of AtaR in a binding-compatible orientation. Our data suggests AtaR neutralizes AtaT as a monomer, right after its synthesis and only the toxin-antitoxin complex formed in this way is an active repressor. Once activated by dimerization, later neutralization of the toxin results in a toxin-antitoxin complex that is not able to repress transcription. Crystal structure of the DNA-bound VapBC2 antitoxin/toxin pair from Rickettsia felis. Besides their commonly attributed role in the maintenance of low-copy number plasmids, toxin/antitoxin (TA) loci, also called 'addiction modules', have been found in chromosomes and associated to a number of biological functions such as: reduction of protein synthesis, gene regulation and retardation of cell growth under nutritional stress. The recent discovery of TA loci in obligatory intracellular species of the Rickettsia genus has\nat least seven MazF orthologs, designated MazF-mt1 through MazF-mt7, four of which have been demonstrated to function as mRNA interferases that selectively target mRNA for cleavage at distinct consensus sequences. As is characteristic of all toxin-antitoxin systems, each of the mazF-mt toxin genes is organized in an operon downstream of putative antitoxin genes. However, only one of the seven putative upstream antitoxins (designated MazE-mt1 through MazE-mt7) has significant sequence similarity to Escherichia coli MazE, the cognate antitoxin for E. coli MazF. Interestingly, the M. tuberculosis genome contains two independent operons encoding E. coli MazE orthologs, but they are not paired with mazF-mt-like genes. Instead, the genes encoding these two MazE orthologs are each paired with proteins containing a PIN domain, indicating that they may be members of the very large VapBC toxin-antitoxin family. We tested a spectrum of pair-wise combinations of cognate and noncognate Mtb toxin-antitoxins using in vivo toxicity\nGenerally, type II antitoxins bind with high specificity to their cognate toxins via a toxin-binding domain and endow the complex with DNA-binding specificity via a DNA-binding domain. Despite the ubiquity of VapBC systems and their critical role in the regulation of gene expression, few functional studies have addressed the details of VapB-VapC interactions. Here we report on the results of experiments designed to identify molecular determinants of the specificity of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis VapB4 antitoxin for its cognate VapC4 toxin. The results identify the minimal domain of VapB4 required for this interaction as well as the amino acid side chains required for binding to VapC4. These findings have important implications for the evolution of VapBC toxin-antitoxin systems and their potential as targets of small-molecule protein-protein interaction inhibitors.IMPORTANCE: VapBC toxin-antitoxin pairs are the most widespread type II toxin-antitoxin systems in bacteria, where they are thought to play key roles in stress-induced\nJDM301, a widely used commercial strain in China, encodes at least two MazEF-like modules and one RelBE-like toxin-antitoxin (TA) system in its chromosome, designated MazE1F1Bif, MazE2F2Bif, and RelBEBif, respectively. Bacterial TA systems play an important role in several stress responses, but the relationship between these TA systems is largely unknown. In this study, the interactions between MazF1Bif and MazE2Bif or RelBBif were assessed in B. longum strain JDM301. MazF1Bif caused the degradation of tufABif mRNA, and its toxicity was inhibited by forming a protein complex with its cognate antitoxin, MazE1Bif Notably, MazF1Bif toxicity was also partially neutralized when jointly expressed with noncognate antitoxin MazE2Bif or RelBBif Our results show that the two noncognate antitoxins also inhibited mRNA degradation caused by MazF1Bif toxin. Furthermore, the physical interplay between MazF1Bif and its noncognate antitoxins was confirmed by immunoprecipitation. These results suggest that MazF1Bif can arrest cell growth and that MazF1Bif toxicity can\nnoncognate antitoxins was confirmed by immunoprecipitation. These results suggest that MazF1Bif can arrest cell growth and that MazF1Bif toxicity can be neutralized by its cognate and noncognate antitoxins. These results imply that JDM301 uses a sophisticated toxin-antitoxin interaction network to alter its physiology when coping with environmental stress.IMPORTANCE Although toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems play an important role in several stress responses, the regulatory mechanisms of multiple TA system homologs in the bacterial genome remain largely unclear. In this study, the relationships between MazE1F1Bif and the other two TA systems of Bifidobacterium longum strain JDM301 were explored, and the interactions between MazF1Bif and MazE2Bif or RelBBif were characterized. In addition, the mRNA degradation activity of MazF1Bif was demonstrated. In particular, the interaction of the toxin with noncognate antitoxins was shown, even between different TA families (MazF1Bif toxin and RelBBif antitoxin) in JDM301. This work provides insight into the regulatory mechanisms of TA\nare the most widespread type II toxin-antitoxin systems in bacteria, where they are thought to play key roles in stress-induced dormancy and the formation of persisters. The VapB antitoxins are critical to these processes because they inhibit the activity of the toxins and provide the DNA-binding specificity that controls the synthesis of both proteins. Despite the importance of VapB antitoxins and the existence of several VapBC crystal structures, little is known about their functional features in vivo. Here we report the findings of the first comprehensive structure-function analysis of a VapB toxin. The results identify the minimal toxin-binding domain, its modular antitoxin function, and the specific amino acid side chains required for its activity. Physical and Functional Interplay between MazF1Bif and Its Noncognate Antitoxins from Bifidobacterium longum. Bifidobacterium longum strain JDM301, a widely used commercial strain in China, encodes at least two MazEF-like modules and one RelBE-like toxin-antitoxin (TA) system\nrole of TA systems in stabilizing the massive SI cassette array of V. cholerae.IMPORTANCE: The chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems have been shown to play various, sometimes contradictory roles, ranging from genomic stabilization to bacterial survival via persistence. Determining the interactions between TA systems hosted within the same bacteria is essential to understand the hierarchy between these different roles. We identify here the full set of class 2 TAs carried in the Vibrio cholerae N16961 genome and found they are all, with a single exception, located in the chromosome 2 superintegron. Their characterization, in terms of functionality, expression, and possible cross-interactions, supports their main role as being the stabilization of the 176-cassette-long array of the superintegron but does not exclude dual roles, such as stress response elements, persistence, and bacteriophage defense through abortive infection mechanisms.\nwhich is known to play a role in antibiotic persistence. We investigated this clustering within the SI and its possible biological consequences by performing a comprehensive functional analysis on all of the putative TA systems. We demonstrate that the 18 TAs identified encode functional toxins and that their cognate antitoxins are able to neutralize their deleterious effects when expressed in Escherichia coli. In addition, we reveal that the 17 predicted TA systems of the SI are transcribed and expressed in their native context from their own promoters, a situation rarely found in integron cassettes. We tested the possibility of interactions between noncognate pairs of all toxins and antitoxins and found no cross-interaction between any of the different TAs. Although these observations do not exclude other roles, they clearly strengthen the role of TA systems in stabilizing the massive SI cassette array of V. cholerae.IMPORTANCE: The chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems have been\nstructure of RnlA refined to 2.10 (Dmd-binding domain), which is an organization not previously observed among known toxin structures. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis revealed that RnlA forms a dimer in solution via interactions between the DBDs from both monomers. The in vitro and in vivo functional studies showed that among the three domains, only the DBD is responsible for recognition and inhibition by Dmd and subcellular location of RnlA. In particular, the helix located at the C-terminus of DBD plays a vital role in binding Dmd. Our comprehensive studies reveal the key region responsible for RnlA toxicity and provide novel insights into its structure-function relationship. Noncognate Mycobacterium tuberculosis toxin-antitoxins can physically and functionally interact. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome harbors a striking number (>40) of toxin-antitoxin systems. Among them are at least seven MazF orthologs, designated MazF-mt1 through MazF-mt7, four of which have been demonstrated to function as mRNA interferases",

It was shown, moreover, that synthesis of sulfate permeases is coordinated with the synthesis of the other methionine biosynthetic enzymes thus far studied in our laboratory. An additional specific regulation of sulfate permeases by inhibition of their activity by endogenous sulfate and adenosyl phosphosulfate (an intermediate metabolite in sulfate assimilation) has been shown. A mutant unable to concentrate sulfate has been selected. This strain carried mutations in two independent genes. These two mutations, separated in two different strains, lead to modified kinetics of sulfate uptake.

Sulfate uptake in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: biochemical and genetic study. Sulfate uptake is the first step of the sulfate assimilation pathway, which has been shown in our laboratory to be part of the methionine biosynthetic pathway. Kinetic study of sulfate uptake has shown a biphasic curve in a Lineweaver-Burk plot. The analysis of this plot indicates that two enzymes participate in sulfate uptake. One (permease I) has a high affinity for the substrate (K(m) = 0.005 mM); the other (permease II) shows a much lower affinity for sulfate (K(m) = 0.35 mM). Regulation of the synthesis of both permeases\nAstA is twice that of the main sulfate transporter SB per mg of dry weight (DW) of mycelium (1.53 vs. 0.85 nmol/min, respectively). Amino acid substitutions in CCL did not abolish sulfate uptake, but affected its kinetic parameters. Mutants affected in the lysine residues forming the postulated sulfate-interacting pocket in AstA were able to grow and uptake sulfate, indicating that CCL is not crucial for sulfate transportation. However, these mutants exhibited altered values of K\u03c4 and Vmax, suggesting that CCL is involved in control of the transporter activity. Functional complementation of internal deletion mutants in the lactose permease of Escherichia coli. Using the lactose permease of Escherichia coli, a well-characterized membrane protein with 12 transmembrane domains, we demonstrated that certain paired in-frame deletion constructs complement each other functionally. Although cells expressing the deletion mutants individually are unable to catalyze active lactose accumulation, cells simultaneously expressing specific pairs of deletions catalyze\nthe spiroplasmal genome, suggesting that the IIBC(Tre) permease probably functions with the IIA(Glc) domain. In agreement with this statement, yeast two-hybrid system experiments revealed that the IIA(Glc) domain interacted not only with IIB(Glc) but also with the IIB(Tre) domain. The results are discussed with respect to the ability of the spiroplasma to adapt from the phloem sap of the host plant to the haemolymph and salivary gland cells of the insect vector. Functional characterization of solute carrier (SLC) 26/sulfate permease (SulP) proteins in membrane mimetic systems. Solute carrier (SLC) 26 or sulfate permease (SulP) anion transporters, belong to a phylogenetically ancient family of secondary active transporters. Members of the family are involved in several human genetic diseases and cell physiological processes. Despite their importance, the substrates for transport by this family of proteins have been poorly characterized. In this study, recombinant StmYchM/DauA, a SulP from Salmonella typhimurium was purified to\nin this paper that part of the unphosphorylated form of enzyme IIMtl can also be extracted from the membrane as a dimer. We further demonstrate that both phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of the permease and conditions promoting turnover of the enzyme decrease the amount of extractable dimer. Thus, the dimer of these forms of the enzyme appears to be less stable than that of the unmodified form, at least in detergent solution. In contrast, inorganic phosphate, which activates the permease-catalyzed phospho exchange between mannitol 1-phosphate and mannitol (\"transphosphorylation\"), stabilizes the dimer. These results support the hypothesis that the mannitol permease dimer is more active in transphosphorylation than the monomer. Treatment of minicell membranes with oxidizing agents produced heat-stable, high molecular weight aggregates of the permease on dodecyl sulfate gels, but no heat-stable dimer could be detected. The nonionic detergent Lubrol PX decreased the amount of dimer extractable at 30 degrees C with\nGap1p and Fur4p, and probably also other proteins. Molecular characterization of central cytoplasmic loop in Aspergillus nidulans AstA transporter. AstA (alternative sulfate transporter) belongs to a large, but poorly characterized, Dal5 family of allantoate permeases of the Major Facilitator Superfamily. The astA gene has been cloned from an IAM 2006 Japanese strain of Aspergillus nidulans by complementation of a sulfate permease-deficient mutant. In this study we show that conserved lysine residues in Central Cytoplasmic Loop (CCL) of the AstA protein may participate in anion selectivity, and control kinetic properties of the AstA transporter. A three-dimensional model containing four clustered lysine residues was created, showing a novel substrate-interacting structure in Major Facilitator Superfamily transporters. The assimilation constant (K\u03c4) of wild type AstA protein is 85 \u03bcM, while Vmax/mg of DW of AstA is twice that of the main sulfate transporter SB per mg of dry weight (DW) of mycelium (1.53 vs.\nbetween the products of these two genes. Membrane disposition of the Escherichia coli mannitol permease: identification of membrane-bound and cytoplasmic domains. Two proteolytic fragments of the Escherichia coli mannitol permease (EIImtl) have been identified on autoradiograms of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and mapped with respect to the membrane. EIImtl was selectively radiolabeled with either [35S]methionine or a mixture of 14C-labeled amino acids in E. coli minicells harboring a plasmid containing the mannitol operon. The intact permease (Mr 65,000) in everted vesicles derived from labeled minicells was cleaved by mild trypsinolysis into two smaller fragments (Mr 34,000 and 29,000). The 34,000-dalton fragment remained in the membrane and was insensitive to further proteolysis by trypsin. This fragment was identified as the N-terminal half of the protein by comparing the amount of the original [35S]methionine label that it retained with the known differential distribution of methionine in the two halves of EIImtl. The\nthe FUR4-encoded uracil permease catalyzes the first step of the pyrimidine salvage pathway. The availability of uracil has a negative regulatory effect upon its own transport. Uracil causes a decrease in the level of uracil permease, partly by decreasing the FUR4 mRNA level in a promoter-independent fashion, probably by increasing its instability. Uracil entry also triggers more rapid degradation of the existing permease by promoting high efficiency of ubiquitination of the permease that signals its internalization. A direct binding of intracellular uracil to the permease is possibly involved in this feedback regulation, as the behavior of the permease is similar in mutant cells unable to convert intracellular uracil into UMP. We used cells impaired in the ubiquitination step to show that the addition of uracil produces rapid inhibition of uracil transport. This may be the first response prior to the removal of the permease from the plasma membrane. Similar down-regulation\nexpressing the deletion mutants individually are unable to catalyze active lactose accumulation, cells simultaneously expressing specific pairs of deletions catalyze transport up to 60% as do cells expressing wild-type permease. Moreover, complementation clearly does not occur at the level of DNA but probably occurs at the protein level. Remarkably, functional complementation is observed only with pairs of permease molecules containing large deletions and is not observed with missense mutations or point deletions. Although the mechanism of functional complementation is obscure, the findings indicate that certain pairs of permease molecules containing specific internal deletions can interact to form a functional complex in the same way phenomenologically as do independently expressed polypeptides corresponding to different N- and C-terminal portions of the permease. Uracil-induced down-regulation of the yeast uracil permease. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the FUR4-encoded uracil permease catalyzes the first step of the pyrimidine salvage pathway. The availability of uracil has a negative\ntransport. This may be the first response prior to the removal of the permease from the plasma membrane. Similar down-regulation of uracil uptake, involving several processes, was observed under adverse conditions mainly corresponding to a decrease in the cellular content of ribosomes. These results suggest that uracil of exogenous or catabolic origin down-regulates the cognate permease to prevent buildup of excess intracellular uracil-derived nucleotides. Subunit interactions of the Escherichia coli mannitol permease: correlation with enzymic activities. A fraction of the phosphorylated form of the Escherichia coli mannitol permease (enzyme IIMtl) of the sugar phosphotransferase system can be extracted from the membrane in a dimeric form [Roossien, F.F., & Robillard, G.T. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 5682-5685]. Using E. coli minicells in which this protein can be specifically labeled with [35S]methionine, we show in this paper that part of the unphosphorylated form of enzyme IIMtl can also be extracted from the membrane as\nsuppressor of purine-cytosine permease from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Possible role of Ser272 in the base translocation process. The purine-cytosine permease from Saccharomyces cerevisiae mediates the active transport through the plasma membrane of adenine, hypoxanthine, guanine and cytosine using the proton electrochemical potential difference as an energy source. Analysis of the activity of strains mutated in a hydrophilic segment (371-377) of the polypeptidic chain has shown the involvement of this segment in the maintenance of the active three-dimensional structure of the carrier. In an attempt to identify permease domains that could interact functionally and/or physically with this segment, we looked for second-site mutations that could suppress the effects of amino acid changes in this region. This paper describes a positive screen that has allowed the isolation of one suppressor from a permease mutant displaying the N374I change (fcy2-20 allele), a substitution that induces a dramatic decrease in the affinity of the carrier\nII (EII(Glc) and EII(Tre)) of the S. citri phosphoenolpyruvate : glucose and phosphoenolpyruvate : trehalose phosphotransferase systems (PTS) were characterized. Mapping studies revealed that the EII(Glc) complex was split into two distinct polypeptides, IIA(Glc) and IICB(Glc), encoded by two separate genes, crr and ptsG, respectively. As expected, S. citri polypeptides IIA(Glc) and IICB(Glc) were more phylogenetically related to their counterparts from Gram-positive than to those from Gram-negative bacteria. The trehalose operon consisted of three genes treR, treP and treA, encoding a transcriptional regulator, the PTS permease (EII(Tre)) and the amylase, respectively. However, in contrast to the fructose-PTS permease, which is encoded as a single polypeptide (IIABC(Fru)) containing the three domains A, B and C, the trehalose-PTS permease (IIBC(Tre)) lacks its own IIA domain. No trehalose-specific IIA could be identified in the spiroplasmal genome, suggesting that the IIBC(Tre) permease probably functions with the IIA(Glc) domain. In agreement with this statement, yeast\noriginal [35S]methionine label that it retained with the known differential distribution of methionine in the two halves of EIImtl. The 29,000-dalton fragment, which was released into the soluble fraction and was sensitive to further trypsinolysis, therefore corresponds to the C-terminal half of the mannitol permease. Both fragments were shown to be antigenically related to EIImtl by immunoblotting with anti-EIImtl antibody. The 34,000-dalton fragment was further shown to form an oligomer under conditions which allow the intact enzyme to dimerize, suggesting that this domain plays an important role in EIImtl subunit interactions. These results support a model in which EIImtl consists of two domains of approximately equal size: a membrane-bound, N-terminal domain with a tendency to self-associate, and a cytoplasmic C-terminal domain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Screening of an intragenic second-site suppressor of purine-cytosine permease from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Possible role of Ser272 in the base translocation process. The purine-cytosine permease from\nstrain showed that, by itself, the S272 L change induced an improvement in the base-binding step that could account for its global suppressive effect. Moreover, S272 L induced a decrease in the turnover of the permease, thus showing the involvement of S272 in the translocation process. Taking into account the topological model of the permease proposed here, this Ser residue is probably located in a transmembrane amphipathic alpha-helix (TM5). The location and the observed decrease in the turnover of the carrier observed with the S272 L change lead us to propose that S272 could be part of a hydrophilic pore involved in the translocation of the base and/or the proton.\nfumarate may serve as substrate under different conditions indicating multiple functions of SulP. NPl1, an essential yeast gene involved in induced degradation of Gap1 and Fur4 permeases, encodes the Rsp5 ubiquitin-protein ligase. When yeast cells growing on a poor nitrogen source are supplied with NH4+ ions, several nitrogen permeases including the general amino acid permease (Gap1p) are rapidly and completely inactivated. This report shows that inactivation by NH4+ of the Gap1 permease is accompanied by its degradation. A functional NPl1 gene product is required for both inactivation and degradation of Gap1p. Molecular analysis of the NPl1 gene showed that it is identical to RSP5. The RSP5 product is a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3 enzyme) whose physiological function was, however, unknown. Its C-terminal region is very similar to that of other members of the E6-AP-like family of ubiquitin-protein ligases. Its N-terminal region contains a single C2 domain that may be a Ca(2+)-dependent\nGlucose and trehalose PTS permeases of Spiroplasma citri probably share a single IIA domain, enabling the spiroplasma to adapt quickly to carbohydrate changes in its environment. Spiroplasma citri is a plant-pathogenic mollicute phylogenetically related to Gram-positive bacteria. Spiroplasma cells are restricted to the phloem sieve tubes and are transmitted from plant to plant by the leafhopper vector Circulifer haematoceps. In the plant sieve tubes, S. citri grows on glucose and fructose, whereas in the leafhopper haemolymph the spiroplasma must grow on trehalose, the major sugar in insects. Previous studies in this laboratory have shown that fructose utilization was a key factor of spiroplasmal pathogenicity. To further study the implication of sugar metabolism in the interactions of S. citri with its plant host and its leafhopper vector, genes encoding permease enzymes II (EII(Glc) and EII(Tre)) of the S. citri phosphoenolpyruvate : glucose and phosphoenolpyruvate : trehalose phosphotransferase systems (PTS) were characterized.\nmutant displaying the N374I change (fcy2-20 allele), a substitution that induces a dramatic decrease in the affinity of the carrier for adenine, cytosine and hypoxanthine. The second-site mutation corresponds to the replacement of the Ser272 residue by Leu. Its suppressive effect is shown to be a partial restoration of the binding of cytosine and hypoxanthine to the permease. To test whether this second-site mutation is specific for the fcy2-20 allele, two double mutants were constructed (Fcy2pT213I, S272L and Fcy2pS272L, N377G). Results obtained with these two double mutants showed that the suppressive effect of S272 L replacement was not specific for the original N374I change. To understand the general effect of this amino acid replacement for the three distinct double mutants, a strain overexpressing Fcy2pS272I, was constructed. Kinetic analysis of this strain showed that, by itself, the S272 L change induced an improvement in the base-binding step that could account for\nof the E6-AP-like family of ubiquitin-protein ligases. Its N-terminal region contains a single C2 domain that may be a Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid interaction motif, followed by several copies of a recently identified domain called WW(P). The Npi1/Rsp5 protein has a homologue both in humans and in mice, the latter being involved in brain development. Stress-induced degradation of the uracil permease (Fur4p), a process in which ubiquitin is probably involved, was also found to require a functional NPl1/RSP5 product. Chromosomal deletion of NPl1/RSP5 showed that this gene is essential for cell viability. In the viable npi1/rsp5 strain, expression of NPl1/RSP5 is reduced as a result of insertion of a Ty1 element in its 5' region. Our results show that the Npi1/Rsp5 ubiquitin-protein ligase participates in induced degradation of at least two permeases, Gap1p and Fur4p, and probably also other proteins. Molecular characterization of central cytoplasmic loop in Aspergillus nidulans AstA transporter. AstA\nfamily of proteins have been poorly characterized. In this study, recombinant StmYchM/DauA, a SulP from Salmonella typhimurium was purified to homogeneity and functionally characterized. StmYchM/DauA was found to be a dimer in solution as determined by size exclusion chromatography coupled to multiple angle light scattering. We report a functional characterization of the SulP proteins in two membrane mimetic systems and reveal a dual nature of anionic substrates for SulP. StmYchM/DauA functionally incorporated into nanodiscs could bind fumarate with millimolar affinities (KD = 4.6 \u00b1 0.29 mM) as detected by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence quench studies. In contrast, electrophysiological experiments performed in reconstituted liposomes indicate a strong bicarbonate transport in the presence of chloride but no detectable electrogenic fumarate transport. We hence suggest that while SulP acts as an electrogenic bicarbonate transporter, fumarate may serve as substrate under different conditions indicating multiple functions of SulP.

Although the mechanism of functional complementation is obscure, the findings indicate that certain pairs of permease molecules containing specific internal deletions can interact to form a functional complex in the same way phenomenologically as do independently expressed polypeptides corresponding to different N- and C-terminal portions of the permease. Uracil-induced down-regulation of the yeast uracil permease. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the FUR4-encoded uracil permease catalyzes the first step of the pyrimidine salvage pathway. The availability of uracil has a negative\ntransport. This may be the first response prior to the removal of the permease from the plasma membrane. Similar down-regulation of uracil uptake, involving several processes, was observed under adverse conditions mainly corresponding to a decrease in the cellular content of ribosomes. These results suggest that uracil of exogenous or catabolic origin down-regulates the cognate permease to prevent buildup of excess intracellular uracil-derived nucleotides. Subunit interactions of the Escherichia coli mannitol permease: correlation with enzymic activities. A fraction of the phosphorylated form of the Escherichia coli mannitol permease (enzyme IIMtl) of the sugar phosphotransferase system can be extracted from the membrane in a dimeric form [Roossien, F.F., & Robillard, G.T. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 5682-5685]. Using E. coli minicells in which this protein can be specifically labeled with [35S]methionine, we show in this paper that part of the unphosphorylated form of enzyme IIMtl can also be extracted from the membrane as\nsuppressor of purine-cytosine permease from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Possible role of Ser272 in the base translocation process. The purine-cytosine permease from Saccharomyces cerevisiae mediates the active transport through the plasma membrane of adenine, hypoxanthine, guanine and cytosine using the proton electrochemical potential difference as an energy source. Analysis of the activity of strains mutated in a hydrophilic segment (371-377) of the polypeptidic chain has shown the involvement of this segment in the maintenance of the active three-dimensional structure of the carrier. In an attempt to identify permease domains that could interact functionally and/or physically with this segment, we looked for second-site mutations that could suppress the effects of amino acid changes in this region. This paper describes a positive screen that has allowed the isolation of one suppressor from a permease mutant displaying the N374I change (fcy2-20 allele), a substitution that induces a dramatic decrease in the affinity of the carrier\nII (EII(Glc) and EII(Tre)) of the S. citri phosphoenolpyruvate : glucose and phosphoenolpyruvate : trehalose phosphotransferase systems (PTS) were characterized. Mapping studies revealed that the EII(Glc) complex was split into two distinct polypeptides, IIA(Glc) and IICB(Glc), encoded by two separate genes, crr and ptsG, respectively. As expected, S. citri polypeptides IIA(Glc) and IICB(Glc) were more phylogenetically related to their counterparts from Gram-positive than to those from Gram-negative bacteria. The trehalose operon consisted of three genes treR, treP and treA, encoding a transcriptional regulator, the PTS permease (EII(Tre)) and the amylase, respectively. However, in contrast to the fructose-PTS permease, which is encoded as a single polypeptide (IIABC(Fru)) containing the three domains A, B and C, the trehalose-PTS permease (IIBC(Tre)) lacks its own IIA domain. No trehalose-specific IIA could be identified in the spiroplasmal genome, suggesting that the IIBC(Tre) permease probably functions with the IIA(Glc) domain. In agreement with this statement, yeast\noriginal [35S]methionine label that it retained with the known differential distribution of methionine in the two halves of EIImtl. The 29,000-dalton fragment, which was released into the soluble fraction and was sensitive to further trypsinolysis, therefore corresponds to the C-terminal half of the mannitol permease. Both fragments were shown to be antigenically related to EIImtl by immunoblotting with anti-EIImtl antibody. The 34,000-dalton fragment was further shown to form an oligomer under conditions which allow the intact enzyme to dimerize, suggesting that this domain plays an important role in EIImtl subunit interactions. These results support a model in which EIImtl consists of two domains of approximately equal size: a membrane-bound, N-terminal domain with a tendency to self-associate, and a cytoplasmic C-terminal domain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Screening of an intragenic second-site suppressor of purine-cytosine permease from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Possible role of Ser272 in the base translocation process. The purine-cytosine permease from\nstrain showed that, by itself, the S272 L change induced an improvement in the base-binding step that could account for its global suppressive effect. Moreover, S272 L induced a decrease in the turnover of the permease, thus showing the involvement of S272 in the translocation process. Taking into account the topological model of the permease proposed here, this Ser residue is probably located in a transmembrane amphipathic alpha-helix (TM5). The location and the observed decrease in the turnover of the carrier observed with the S272 L change lead us to propose that S272 could be part of a hydrophilic pore involved in the translocation of the base and/or the proton.\nfumarate may serve as substrate under different conditions indicating multiple functions of SulP. NPl1, an essential yeast gene involved in induced degradation of Gap1 and Fur4 permeases, encodes the Rsp5 ubiquitin-protein ligase. When yeast cells growing on a poor nitrogen source are supplied with NH4+ ions, several nitrogen permeases including the general amino acid permease (Gap1p) are rapidly and completely inactivated. This report shows that inactivation by NH4+ of the Gap1 permease is accompanied by its degradation. A functional NPl1 gene product is required for both inactivation and degradation of Gap1p. Molecular analysis of the NPl1 gene showed that it is identical to RSP5. The RSP5 product is a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3 enzyme) whose physiological function was, however, unknown. Its C-terminal region is very similar to that of other members of the E6-AP-like family of ubiquitin-protein ligases. Its N-terminal region contains a single C2 domain that may be a Ca(2+)-dependent\nGlucose and trehalose PTS permeases of Spiroplasma citri probably share a single IIA domain, enabling the spiroplasma to adapt quickly to carbohydrate changes in its environment. Spiroplasma citri is a plant-pathogenic mollicute phylogenetically related to Gram-positive bacteria. Spiroplasma cells are restricted to the phloem sieve tubes and are transmitted from plant to plant by the leafhopper vector Circulifer haematoceps. In the plant sieve tubes, S. citri grows on glucose and fructose, whereas in the leafhopper haemolymph the spiroplasma must grow on trehalose, the major sugar in insects. Previous studies in this laboratory have shown that fructose utilization was a key factor of spiroplasmal pathogenicity. To further study the implication of sugar metabolism in the interactions of S. citri with its plant host and its leafhopper vector, genes encoding permease enzymes II (EII(Glc) and EII(Tre)) of the S. citri phosphoenolpyruvate : glucose and phosphoenolpyruvate : trehalose phosphotransferase systems (PTS) were characterized.\nmutant displaying the N374I change (fcy2-20 allele), a substitution that induces a dramatic decrease in the affinity of the carrier for adenine, cytosine and hypoxanthine. The second-site mutation corresponds to the replacement of the Ser272 residue by Leu. Its suppressive effect is shown to be a partial restoration of the binding of cytosine and hypoxanthine to the permease. To test whether this second-site mutation is specific for the fcy2-20 allele, two double mutants were constructed (Fcy2pT213I, S272L and Fcy2pS272L, N377G). Results obtained with these two double mutants showed that the suppressive effect of S272 L replacement was not specific for the original N374I change. To understand the general effect of this amino acid replacement for the three distinct double mutants, a strain overexpressing Fcy2pS272I, was constructed. Kinetic analysis of this strain showed that, by itself, the S272 L change induced an improvement in the base-binding step that could account for\nof the E6-AP-like family of ubiquitin-protein ligases. Its N-terminal region contains a single C2 domain that may be a Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid interaction motif, followed by several copies of a recently identified domain called WW(P). The Npi1/Rsp5 protein has a homologue both in humans and in mice, the latter being involved in brain development. Stress-induced degradation of the uracil permease (Fur4p), a process in which ubiquitin is probably involved, was also found to require a functional NPl1/RSP5 product. Chromosomal deletion of NPl1/RSP5 showed that this gene is essential for cell viability. In the viable npi1/rsp5 strain, expression of NPl1/RSP5 is reduced as a result of insertion of a Ty1 element in its 5' region. Our results show that the Npi1/Rsp5 ubiquitin-protein ligase participates in induced degradation of at least two permeases, Gap1p and Fur4p, and probably also other proteins. Molecular characterization of central cytoplasmic loop in Aspergillus nidulans AstA transporter. AstA\nfamily of proteins have been poorly characterized. In this study, recombinant StmYchM/DauA, a SulP from Salmonella typhimurium was purified to homogeneity and functionally characterized. StmYchM/DauA was found to be a dimer in solution as determined by size exclusion chromatography coupled to multiple angle light scattering. We report a functional characterization of the SulP proteins in two membrane mimetic systems and reveal a dual nature of anionic substrates for SulP. StmYchM/DauA functionally incorporated into nanodiscs could bind fumarate with millimolar affinities (KD = 4.6 \u00b1 0.29 mM) as detected by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence quench studies. In contrast, electrophysiological experiments performed in reconstituted liposomes indicate a strong bicarbonate transport in the presence of chloride but no detectable electrogenic fumarate transport. We hence suggest that while SulP acts as an electrogenic bicarbonate transporter, fumarate may serve as substrate under different conditions indicating multiple functions of SulP.

        "desc": "MazF homodimer is a bidentate endoribonuclease equipped with two identical binding sites for mRNA processing and that a single MazE molecule occupying one of the binding sites can affect the conformation of both sites, hence efficiently hindering the activity of MazF. Noncognate Mycobacterium tuberculosis toxin-antitoxins can physically and functionally interact. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome harbors a striking number (>40) of toxin-antitoxin systems. Among them are at least seven MazF orthologs, designated MazF-mt1 through MazF-mt7, four of which have been demonstrated to function as mRNA interferases that selectively target mRNA for cleavage at distinct consensus sequences. As is characteristic of all toxin-antitoxin systems, each of the mazF-mt toxin genes is organized in an operon downstream of putative antitoxin genes. However, only one of the seven putative upstream antitoxins (designated MazE-mt1 through MazE-mt7) has significant sequence similarity to Escherichia coli MazE, the cognate antitoxin for E. coli MazF. Interestingly, the M. tuberculosis\nprocessed to individual functional proteins by virus-encoded specific proteases. These proteases have been used as targets for drug development. Here, instead of targeting these proteases to inhibit viral infection, we utilized the protease activity to activate a toxic protein to prevent viral infection. We engineered the MazE-MazF antitoxin-toxin system of Escherichia coli to fuse a C-terminal 41-residue fragment of antitoxin MazE to the N-terminal end of toxin MazF with a linker having a specific protease cleavage site for either HIV PR (HIV-1 protease), NS3 protease (HCV protease), or factor Xa. These fusion proteins formed a stable dimer (instead of the MazF(2)-MazE(2)-MazF(2) heterohexamer in nature) to inactivate the ACA (sequence)-specific mRNA interferase activity of MazF. When the fusion proteins were incubated with the corresponding proteases, the MazE fragment was cleaved from the fusion proteins, releasing active MazF, which then acted as an ACA-specific mRNA interferase cleaving single-stranded MS2 phage RNA. The\nof MazF4 with its RNA substrate and with a new EDF homolog originating from M. tuberculosis The EDF homolog discovered here possesses a positively charged residue at the C terminus, making this EDF distinct from previously reported EDFs. Overall, our results suggest that M. tuberculosis evolved a unique MazF and EDF and that the distinctive EDF sequence could serve as a starting point for designing new anti-tuberculosis drugs. We therefore conclude that this study might contribute to the development of a new line of anti-tuberculosis agents. Intramolecular regulation of the sequence-specific mRNA interferase activity of MazF fused to a MazE fragment with a linker cleavable by specific proteases. The genomes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) consist of single-stranded RNA encoding polyproteins, which are processed to individual functional proteins by virus-encoded specific proteases. These proteases have been used as targets for drug development. Here,\nsystems participate as gene regulators within bacteria. The TA systems contribute to the long-term dormancy of Mtb within the host-cell environment. Mtb's toxin MazF4 (Rv1495) that is part of the MazEF4 TA system has been shown to have dual activities as endoribonuclease and topoisomerase I inhibitor. We have developed a complementary assay using an Escherichia coli strain with temperature-sensitive topA mutation to provide new insights into the MazF4 action. The assay showed that E. coli is not sensitive to the endoribonuclease activity of Mtb MazF4 but became vulnerable to MazF4 growth inhibition when recombinant Mtb TopA relaxation activity is required for growth. Results from the complementation by Mtb TopA mutants with C-terminal deletions showed that the lysine-rich C-terminal tail is required for interaction with MazF4. Site-directed mutagenesis is utilized to identify two lysine residues within a conserved motif in this C-terminal tail that are critical for MazF4 inhibition. We performed\nMycobacterium growth in different stress conditions and, thus, targeting Rv1636 makes M. tuberculosis vulnerable to host-derived stress conditions. Structural basis of mRNA recognition and cleavage by toxin MazF and its regulation by antitoxin MazE in Bacillus subtilis. MazF is an mRNA interferase, which, upon activation during stress conditions, cleaves mRNAs in a sequence-specific manner, resulting in cellular growth arrest. During normal growth conditions, the MazF toxin is inactivated through binding to its cognate antitoxin, MazE. How MazF specifically recognizes its mRNA target and carries out cleavage and how the formation of the MazE-MazF complex inactivates MazF remain unclear. We present crystal structures of MazF in complex with mRNA substrate and antitoxin MazE in Bacillus subtilis. The structure of MazF in complex with uncleavable UUdUACAUAA RNA substrate defines the molecular basis underlying the sequence-specific recognition of UACAU and the role of residues involved in the cleavage through site-specific mutational studies. The\nunderlying the sequence-specific recognition of UACAU and the role of residues involved in the cleavage through site-specific mutational studies. The structure of the heterohexameric (MazF)2-(MazE)2-(MazF)2 complex in Bacillus subtilis, supplemented by mutational data, demonstrates that the positioning of the C-terminal helical segment of MazE within the RNA-binding channel of the MazF dimer prevents mRNA binding and cleavage by MazF. Localization of Mycobacterium tuberculosis topoisomerase I C-terminal sequence motif required for inhibition by endogenous toxin MazF4. Only about half the multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases are successfully cured. Thus, there is an urgent need of new TB treatment against a novel target. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) topoisomerase I (TopA) is the only type IA topoisomerase in this organism and has been validated as an essential target for TB drug discovery. Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems participate as gene regulators within bacteria. The TA systems contribute to the long-term dormancy of Mtb within the host-cell\nof which have been suggested to play a role in the establishment and maintenance of latent tuberculosis. Nine of these toxin-antitoxin loci belong to the mazEF family, encoding the intracellular toxin MazF and its antitoxin inhibitor MazE. Nearly every MazF ortholog recognizes a unique three- or five-base RNA sequence and cleaves mRNA. As a result, these toxins selectively target a subset of the transcriptome for degradation and are known as \"mRNA interferases.\" Here we demonstrate that a MazF family member from M. tuberculosis, MazF-mt6, has an additional role--inhibiting translation through targeted cleavage of 23S rRNA in the evolutionarily conserved helix/loop 70. We first determined that MazF-mt6 cleaves mRNA at (5')UU\u2193CCU(3') sequences. We then discovered that MazF-mt6 also cleaves M. tuberculosis 23S rRNA at a single UUCCU in the ribosomal A site that contacts tRNA and ribosome recycling factor. To gain further mechanistic insight, we demonstrated that MazF-mt6-mediated cleavage of rRNA\na sophisticated toxin-antitoxin network to alter its physiology in response to environmental cues. ACA-specific RNA sequence recognition is acquired via the loop 2 region of MazF mRNA interferase. MazF is an mRNA interferase that cleaves mRNAs at a specific RNA sequence. MazF from E. coli (MazF-ec) cleaves RNA at A^CA. To date, a large number of MazF homologs that cleave RNA at specific three- to seven-base sequences have been identified from bacteria to archaea. MazF-ec forms a dimer, in which the interface between the two subunits is known to be the RNA substrate-binding site. Here, we investigated the role of the two loops in MazF-ec, which are closely associated with the interface of the MazF-ec dimer. We examined whether exchanging the loop regions of MazF-ec with those from other MazF homologs, such as MazF from Myxococcus xanthus (MazF-mx) and MazF from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MazF-mt3), affects RNA cleavage specificity. We found\nCharacterization of dual substrate binding sites in the homodimeric structure of Escherichia coli mRNA interferase MazF. MazF and MazE constitute a so-called addiction module that is critical for bacterial growth arrest and eventual cell death in response to stress. The MazF toxin was recently shown to possess mRNA interferase (MIase) activity, and acts as a protein synthesis inhibitor by cleaving cellular mRNA. As a cognate regulator, the short-lived antitoxin, MazE, inhibits MazF MIase activity and hence maintains the delicate homeostasis between these two components. In the present study, we have shown that the MazF homodimer contains two symmetric binding sites, each of which is capable of interacting with a MazE C-terminal peptide, MazEp(54-77). The slow exchange phenomenon between free and peptide-bound MazF on the NMR timescale indicates relatively high affinities for MazEp(54-77) at both sites (Kd,K'd < 10(-7) M). However, the observed sequential binding behavior suggests a negative cooperativity between\nhomologs, such as MazF from Myxococcus xanthus (MazF-mx) and MazF from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MazF-mt3), affects RNA cleavage specificity. We found that exchanging loop 2 of MazF-ec with loop 2 regions from either MazF-mx or MazF-mt3 created a new cleavage sequence at (A/U)(A/U)AA^C in addition to the original cleavage site, A^CA, whereas exchanging loop 1 did not alter cleavage specificity. Intriguingly, exchange of loop 2 with 8 or 12 consecutive Gly residues also resulted in a new RNA cleavage site at (A/U)(A/U)AA^C. The present study suggests a method for expanding the RNA cleavage repertoire of mRNA interferases, which is crucial for potential use in the regulation of specific gene expression and for biotechnological applications. Functional and structural characterization of Deinococcus radiodurans R1 MazEF toxin-antitoxin system, Dr0416-Dr0417. In prokaryotes, toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are commonly found. They likely reflect the adaptation of pathogenic bacteria or extremophiles to various unfavorable environments by slowing their\nsite that contacts tRNA and ribosome recycling factor. To gain further mechanistic insight, we demonstrated that MazF-mt6-mediated cleavage of rRNA can inhibit protein synthesis in the absence of mRNA cleavage. Finally, consistent with the position of 23S rRNA cleavage, MazF-mt6 destabilized 50S-30S ribosomal subunit association. Collectively, these results show that MazF toxins do not universally act as mRNA interferases, because MazF-mt6 inhibits protein synthesis by cleaving 23S rRNA in the ribosome active center. Structural analyses of the MazEF4 toxin-antitoxin pair in Mycobacterium tuberculosis provide evidence for a unique extracellular death factor. The bacterial toxin-antitoxin MazEF system in the tuberculosis (TB)-causing bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis is activated under unfavorable conditions, including starvation, antibiotic exposure, and oxidative stress. This system contains the ribonucleolytic enzyme MazF and has emerged as a promising drug target for TB treatments targeting the latent stage of M. tuberculosis infection and reportedly mediates a cell death process via a\nMazE-mt7) has significant sequence similarity to Escherichia coli MazE, the cognate antitoxin for E. coli MazF. Interestingly, the M. tuberculosis genome contains two independent operons encoding E. coli MazE orthologs, but they are not paired with mazF-mt-like genes. Instead, the genes encoding these two MazE orthologs are each paired with proteins containing a PIN domain, indicating that they may be members of the very large VapBC toxin-antitoxin family. We tested a spectrum of pair-wise combinations of cognate and noncognate Mtb toxin-antitoxins using in vivo toxicity and rescue experiments along with in vitro interaction experiments. Surprisingly, we uncovered several examples of noncognate toxin-antitoxin association, even among different families (e.g. MazF toxins and VapB antitoxins). These results challenge the \"one toxin for one antitoxin\" dogma and suggest that M. tuberculosis may enlist a sophisticated toxin-antitoxin network to alter its physiology in response to environmental cues. ACA-specific RNA sequence recognition is acquired via\nthe fusion proteins, releasing active MazF, which then acted as an ACA-specific mRNA interferase cleaving single-stranded MS2 phage RNA. The intramolecular regulation of MazF toxicity by proteases as demonstrated may provide a novel approach for preventive and therapeutic treatments of infection by HIV-1, HCV, and other single-stranded RNA viruses. Potential Efficacy of \u03b2-Amyrin Targeting Mycobacterial Universal Stress Protein by In Vitro and In Silico Approach. The emergence of drug resistance and the limited number of approved antitubercular drugs prompted identification and development of new antitubercular compounds to cure Tuberculosis (TB). In this work, an attempt was made to identify potential natural compounds that target mycobacterial proteins. Three plant extracts (A. aspera, C. gigantea and C. procera) were investigated. The ethyl acetate fraction of the aerial part of A. aspera and the flower ash of C. gigantea were found to be effective against M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Furthermore, the GC-MS analysis of\nfor TB treatments targeting the latent stage of M. tuberculosis infection and reportedly mediates a cell death process via a peptide called extracellular death factor (EDF). Although it is well established that the increase in EDF-mediated toxicity of MazF drives a cell-killing phenomenon, the molecular details are poorly understood. Moreover, the divergence in sequences among reported EDFs suggests that each bacterial species has a unique EDF. To address these open questions, we report here the structures of MazF4 and MazEF4 complexes from M. tuberculosis, representing the first MazEF structures from this organism. We found that MazF4 possesses a negatively charged MazE4-binding pocket in contrast to the positively charged MazE-binding pockets in homologous MazEF complex structures from other bacteria. Moreover, using NMR spectroscopy and biochemical assays, we unraveled the molecular interactions of MazF4 with its RNA substrate and with a new EDF homolog originating from M. tuberculosis The EDF homolog discovered\nidentify two lysine residues within a conserved motif in this C-terminal tail that are critical for MazF4 inhibition. We performed molecular dynamics simulations to predict the Mtb TopA-MazF4 complex. Our simulation results show that the complex is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions established by residues in the TopA C-terminal tail including the two conserved lysines. The mechanism of Mtb TopA inhibition by MazF4 could be useful for the discovery of novel inhibitors against a new antibacterial target in pathogenic mycobacteria for treatment of both TB and diseases caused by the non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM).\nfor MazEp(54-77) at both sites (Kd,K'd < 10(-7) M). However, the observed sequential binding behavior suggests a negative cooperativity between the two sites (Kd < K'd). A 13 base single-stranded DNA, employed as an uncleavable RNA substrate analog, can also bind to both sites on the MazF homodimer with moderate affinity (Kd approximately 10(-5) -10(-6) M). Chemical shift perturbation data deduced from NMR experiments indicates that the two binding sites for the MazEp peptide coincided with those for the single-stranded DNA competitive inhibitor. These dual substrate-binding sites are located on the concave interface of the MazF homodimer, consisting of a highly basic region underneath the S1-S2 loop and two hydrophobic regions containing the H1 helix of one subunit and the S3-S4 loop of the opposing subunit. We show that the MazF homodimer is a bidentate endoribonuclease equipped with two identical binding sites for mRNA processing and that a single MazE\nthe flower ash of C. gigantea were found to be effective against M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Furthermore, the GC-MS analysis of the plant fractions confirmed the presence of active compounds in the extracts. The Mycobacterium target proteins, i.e., available PDB dataset proteins and proteins classified in virulence, detoxification, and adaptation, were investigated. A total of ten target proteins were shortlisted for further study, identified as follows: BpoC, RipA, MazF4, RipD, TB15.3, VapC15, VapC20, VapC21, TB31.7, and MazF9. Molecular docking studies showed that \u03b2-amyrin interacted with most of these proteins and its highest binding affinity was observed with Mycobacterium Rv1636 (TB15.3) protein. The stability of the protein-ligand complex was assessed by molecular dynamic simulation, which confirmed that \u03b2-amyrin most firmly interacted with Rv1636 protein. Rv1636 is a universal stress protein, which regulates Mycobacterium growth in different stress conditions and, thus, targeting Rv1636 makes M. tuberculosis vulnerable to host-derived stress conditions. Structural basis\nan important role in survival. To understand the regulatory mechanism at the molecular level, we determined the first high-resolution structures of DrMazF alone and of the DrMazE-MazF complex. In contrast with the hetero-hexameric state of typical MazE-MazF complexes found in other species, DrMazE-MazF crystal structure consists of a hetero-trimer, with the DNA-binding domain of DrMazE undergoing self-cleavage at the flexible linker loop. Our structure revealed that the unique residue R54 provides an additional positive charge to the substrate-binding pocket of DrMazF, its mutation significantly affects the endonuclease activity. Thus, our work reports the unique structural and biochemical features of the DrMazE-MazF system. Mycobacterial toxin MazF-mt6 inhibits translation through cleavage of 23S rRNA at the ribosomal A site. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome contains an unusually high number of toxin-antitoxin modules, some of which have been suggested to play a role in the establishment and maintenance of latent tuberculosis. Nine of these\nare commonly found. They likely reflect the adaptation of pathogenic bacteria or extremophiles to various unfavorable environments by slowing their growth rate. Genomic analysis of the extremophile Deinococcus radiodurans R1 revealed the presence of eight type II TA systems, including the genes dr0417, dr0660, dr1530, dr0690, and dr1807. Expression of these toxin genes led to inhibition of Escherichia coli growth, whereas their antidote antitoxins were able to recover the growth defect. Remarkably, Dr0417 (DrMazF) showed endoribonuclease activity toward rRNAs as well as mRNAs, as determined by in vivo and in vitro RNA cleavage assays, and this activity was inhibited by Dr0416 (DrMazE). It was also found that the expression of dr0416-0417 module is directly regulated by the DrMazE-MazF complex. Furthermore, this TA module was induced under stress conditions and plays an important role in survival. To understand the regulatory mechanism at the molecular level, we determined the first high-resolution structures",
